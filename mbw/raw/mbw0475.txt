[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.960]   Say hello to Chris Markward, all the way from Toobingon.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   And over now.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.760]   And over.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.760]   The viewfinder villa.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.760]   Look.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.520]   I'm right up.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.160]   Oh, my hair.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.600]   Oh, my hair.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.560]   He's got a face.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.640]   He's got-- wow, that's so exciting.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.360]   So glad to have you.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.000]   You were in the States for a couple of workshops.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.880]   Yeah, I was in San Diego holding a workshop,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.840]   a photo workshop.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.040]   I will do another one in New York City next weekend.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.600]   And then I'll spend a few more days in upstate New York
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.440]   and then I'll fly back home.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.940]   Nice.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.080]   Love upstate New York.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.200]   Chris, of course, is the photo guy on the radio show,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.600]   the tech-eye radio show.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.240]   But he's been a longtime friend of the podcast.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.280]   Since the first podcast expo, when
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.440]   I met you with your Nokia P90 video phone--
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680]   Video phone and you wanted to take it away from me.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.160]   I did.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.800]   I have one now, but I don't use it anymore.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   I'm sad to say.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.300]   Yeah?
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.360]   It was a pretty nice machine now for the time.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.480]   It was.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.080]   And in the beautiful-- in the nation's capital,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.360]   it's Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.120]   But actually, with a green screen, he really could be anywhere.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.880]   I know.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.200]   But I am in DC for the moment.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.440]   That picture behind you is not the actual capital building.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.600]   Well, no, no.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.360]   It's not a green screen.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.640]   It's actually a TV.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.840]   You should have stopped it with it's not a green screen.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.360]   OK.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.600]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.640]   Nice to have you.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.600]   But there's no window here.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.080]   So it's quieter that way because we're right next to traffic.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.560]   It's good.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.760]   Right, exactly.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.840]   Exactly.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.960]   And of course, sitting next to him
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.320]   from Montreal, Canada, Renee Richie, iMoor.com.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.520]   It's been busy, busy, busy.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.320]   Just published this morning.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.280]   His 8 million word synopsis of everything
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.520]   in the new iPhone 6S.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.640]   Only 10,000 Leo.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.400]   I stopped short.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.200]   10,000?
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.400]   Why?
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.520]   That's Europe, punter.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.080]   That's nothing.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.720]   I know.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.480]   I feel lazy.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.760]   And we had Andrew Cunningham on Twitter, and I asked him
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.160]   how many words he wrote to replace Syracuse's mammoth reviews
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.040]   of El Capitan and a mere 14,000.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.240]   And Syracuse is one person.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.320]   That's the outlandish thing.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.680]   That's true.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.920]   It took three to write the 14,000.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.480]   Still another great R's Technica review
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.240]   of El Capitan.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.520]   We'll talk about that.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.480]   Finally, Andy Enoco, who's not in his normal lair,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.240]   but has emerged.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.560]   Yes, as you can see, but just like Alex,
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.600]   I have the signature background that you just look,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.920]   and you know that, oh, he must be a New York City.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.880]   There's the--
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.320]   I see Times Square.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.760]   The light bulb, the famous--
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.000]   Is that the ball that drops at midnight on New Year's Eve?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.960]   Behind you there.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.720]   Oh, you can see that?
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.960]   But what they told me to do is just put little X's
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.200]   on the screen, and that's where they're
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.560]   going to mat in all the signature bills.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.920]   Yeah, later.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.920]   And those are great--
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.760]   --cranky marks.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.680]   Later, we'll be putting that in.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.560]   Andy, you're in New York for the Microsoft event.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.080]   Yep, I just came right from there about 10 blocks away
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.720]   near Penn Station.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.560]   So I've got about my own like 2,500 words,
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.760]   worth of notes and phones full of pictures of stuff.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   Where was it?
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   Was it in the old post office?
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.480]   --frememcatered food, so--
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.280]   Was it in the old post office?
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.200]   Yeah, they made a space that--
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.000]   That's kind of a big camera.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.840]   --and I actually got tossed and corrected up.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.040]   Yeah, it looked kind of comfy, though.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.480]   They had an armchairs, leather, a polstered armchairs.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.880]   Did you see Paul and Mary Jo there?
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.160]   I saw Mary Jo.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.960]   I didn't say hi, because we were both stripped
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.000]   to the past of the night.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.120]   But yeah, it's like--
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.720]   You know how it is in these events?
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.360]   It's like a combination of, oh my god,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.400]   Neil, I haven't seen you in a while.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.960]   OK, well, I've got to take this picture.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.360]   Why don't you finish your interview?
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.200]   I'm kind of busy.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.560]   We'll see each other the next time we're broken.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.600]   I know this is the Mac show, but Apple took front and center
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.320]   at the Microsoft event.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.440]   Both the Surface Pro 4 and the new Surface Book
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.280]   were directly aimed at the MacBook Air
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.600]   and the MacBook Pro, respectively.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.880]   Well, there are a couple of reasons for that.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.280]   I mean, obviously, it would not be polite for them
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.200]   to compete against Dell and Acer and Lenovo.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.600]   So the only ones that can really--
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.960]   hardware they can really compare themselves to without offending
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.160]   any of their partners is Mac.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.040]   But yeah, that was all over the place.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.760]   It was funny.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.400]   When they're showing off new Surface Pro,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.800]   they were showing off an architecture sketch program.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.240]   And the first sketch that was up there for all of, like, five
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.360]   seconds was a technical drawing of a refrigerator
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.160]   with toaster slots on it before they got into that.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.360]   He said he was punked by his colleagues,
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.000]   Penos Pena, who was showing the new Surface.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.840]   But they pulled a little Apple at the event.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.440]   First of all, very well done.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.800]   Unique Microsoft styling, wood paneling,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.000]   and all that very Pacific Northwest.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.480]   But they pulled one more thing.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   We knew rumor mill was pretty accurate in its predictions
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.120]   about the new two new phones, the 950, the 950 XL.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.080]   We knew everything there was to know about the Surface Pro 4.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.760]   But then at the very end, they pulled something out of a hat
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.200]   that no one had thought about.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.800]   Mary Jofoli said last week she felt there
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.320]   was going to be a big one more thing,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.080]   but she didn't know what it was.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.000]   What did you think?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.400]   They call it the Surface Book.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.880]   Really, really cool.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   Essentially, what they did was they took the Surface Pro,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.520]   took a couple of components out of it,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.000]   and put it into this really good-- it's not even a keyboard
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   dock.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.960]   And so basically, you have a really, really slick, elegant,
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.320]   really, really fast 12-hour battery life i7 Windows notebook.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.880]   But then you press a button and you can pull the top off of it.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.520]   It leaves behind a GPU and half of its battery,
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.880]   and you wind up with a tablet that can do everything
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.360]   the Surface 4 can do.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.280]   But it's much, much lighter and it's much, much slimmer.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.600]   The design is really, really cool, too.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.120]   The keyboard is about the best I've ever experienced
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.480]   on a notebook.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.440]   And just the styling is really cool.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.600]   They have this sort of like a link chain.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.120]   They can just sort of like a link chain, if you could imagine.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.360]   So instead of being like one hinge put in like this,
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.240]   it's like a suspension bridge.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.440]   And so as a result, when you hold it in your hand,
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.720]   it's like holding like a folded newspaper or a folded notebook
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.240]   where it's kind of thicker where your hand is gripping it.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.760]   Nonetheless, when you take it apart,
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.200]   pulls apart really easily, it holds together so solidly.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.720]   You can hold it by one corner.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.880]   Really, really nice device.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.480]   They also, they're putting touch in this.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.080]   And this is something Apple has resisted doing
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.640]   in the MacBook Pro for some time.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.080]   Not just touch, but there's a pen with an eraser on the tip.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.760]   And they had a little nudge at Apple by--
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.600]   - One little nudge there with 1024 levels
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.000]   of pressure sensitivity.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.800]   I mean, I gotta tell you, it was my real thought
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.120]   as I was watching this, as soon as they did the trick
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.480]   where I actually was finished, like,
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.320]   look like they were wrapping up that section.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.920]   And so I was taking notes, say, okay, is it convertible?
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.440]   Is it the screen, a cut screen?
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.560]   Is it really just a notebook?
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.920]   And that's when they showed the same
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.840]   in product introduction video a second time,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.280]   only now with demonstrating the pull apart stuff.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.640]   And that's when I said that if this were a MacBook,
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.560]   I wouldn't even be aware of the MacBook Pro
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.840]   or the MacBook Air or the iPad Pro.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.760]   This would absolutely no question be the notebook
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.600]   that I would buy.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.080]   The only problem with it for me is that it runs Windows.Mac.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.360]   It was kind of my thought in the back of my head.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.960]   Shame about the operating system now.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.040]   (laughs)
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.880]   What nice hardware.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.960]   One of the things they did, they have a,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.040]   the attachment mechanism is using a kind of wire
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.280]   that shrinks when it's charged, it's called memory wire.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.000]   So the attachment mechanism is not physical,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.520]   at least from the user's point of view,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.640]   you have a key on the keyboard, an electronic key.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.560]   When you push it, it charges the wire and it shrinks
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.720]   and it pops right off.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.920]   That is a remarkable feature.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.320]   An Apple, dare I say, an Apple-esque feature,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.200]   new materials and so forth.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.040]   - Yeah, the whole thing is Apple-esque.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.680]   When you hold both the Surface Pro and the notebook
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.200]   in your hand, there are no seams, there are no gaps.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.360]   It's all metal, it feels solidly constructed.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.800]   You like the design notes,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.520]   it just is a static object, it's a really beautiful thing.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.360]   Again, if this were announced as a Mac notebook,
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.560]   if it didn't light up and you didn't know
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.920]   there was a touchscreen or anything like that,
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.520]   you would think that while it's interesting
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.200]   that they're taking another turn in design language.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.720]   But this is exactly why Microsoft has to do stuff like this
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   because Dell and Acer and the rest,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.800]   it's not really in their best interest
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.120]   to make really supremely nicely styled notebooks
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.440]   because their customers aren't the sort of people
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.880]   who would be willing to spend extra money
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.880]   for really nice style and that sort of stuff.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.840]   But I spent about half hour, 45 minutes in the demo room,
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.320]   just a lot of it was just holding it in my hands
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.760]   and turning it over and over and over.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.880]   And like I said, it's just a really beautiful object.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.400]   - And Apple priced, I might add, they started 14.99
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.880]   but the one you want is probably twice, almost twice that.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.160]   If you want the i7 and the 16 gigs of RAM and the big SSD,
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.960]   they go up to a terabyte but they start at 128.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.520]   But what it really raises-- - You're gonna do it
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.720]   and you're gonna do it anytime with it.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.280]   - What it raises for me in the context of Apple,
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.600]   and I love the whole panel to comment on this,
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.080]   is as bad as Windows 8 was,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.240]   it was Microsoft trying to integrate touch
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.000]   and tab it like features into a desktop OS.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.680]   It was a horrible mismatch.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.760]   Windows 10 fixes a lot of that.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.760]   But it gave Microsoft in a way a lead in a touch first OS.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.480]   It made Windows a touch OS.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.800]   Apple has always said, you know,
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.920]   nobody's gonna wanna touch a laptop screen
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.720]   so we're just not gonna do it.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   Our touch OS is iOS.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.360]   Now I'm wondering, was that a mistake, Chris?
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.400]   What do you think?
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.240]   You're a photographer, I could see some real uses
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.520]   in Lightroom and Photoshop with the pen.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.800]   - Well, and at least those are available on Windows.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.080]   They are not just on the Mac, so that could certainly work.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.360]   It looks interesting, even if they even have a glass trackpad.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.200]   (laughs)
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.800]   - It's a MacBook. - It is a MacBook,
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.040]   you know, but with an SD card slot,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.000]   it looks very similar to a MacBook.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's got a Thunderbolt, I don't know if it's Thunderbolt,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.840]   it's got a mini DisplayPort connector.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.000]   - And USB 3s and stuff.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.800]   - 6 megapixel screen though, I mean, it's crazy.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.720]   - It's crazy. - Phenomenal.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.680]   - That is crazy. - 3000 by 2000.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.400]   Also, taking a play from the Apple Playbook,
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.560]   it's a three by two screen.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.200]   It's not a wide 16 by nine.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.480]   - Which is the same form factor,
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.120]   or the same aspect ratio that DSLRs have.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.040]   - Yeah, and SLRs. - It's a photographer's.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.400]   - From that point of view, certainly.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.480]   I haven't really played with Windows 10 yet,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.280]   and I'm not sure how this whole thing works.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.640]   - You might make a great hack and touch.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.120]   Except there's no touch in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.520]   - I'm firmly rooted in the Apple ecosystem,
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.120]   so I'm used to this operating system
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.040]   on a desktop or laptop,
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.960]   and an operating system on the touch devices.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.560]   For me, that works.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.000]   But I'm pretty sure this is gonna be very appealing.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   - This is in a way aimed at the iPad Pro
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.560]   as much as it is at the MacBook.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.040]   - Well, it's gonna pan, so.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.920]   - Yeah.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.440]   - Is that, do we know about the pen?
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.640]   Like, is it touch sensitive?
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   - It is, it's a 1024, as Andy said, 1024 pressure levels.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.440]   I don't know about the angle sensitive.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.280]   They did show that it has detachable tips.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.160]   - 'Cause that's what Apple does.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.520]   You go, you go at an angle.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.360]   - Yeah, I like that.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.520]   - And you do like with a pencil, you can't--
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.360]   - I suspect it doesn't do that.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.400]   Andy, did you try that?
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.240]   - I did try it.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.840]   I don't believe it has angle sensitivity.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.680]   - Yeah.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.520]   - But that was...
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   - Let me ask Alex Lindsay,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.320]   for one feel like a felt tip, whatever you wanna do.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.720]   - Right, I love that you could replace it
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.360]   with a variety of different tips
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.480]   that give it a different feel.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.720]   - Oh, that's a jabbed wake on.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.680]   - Yeah, it's really, now also a jab at Apple,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.520]   it's not a rechargeable.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.360]   I think some people thought it was a little odd,
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.160]   they rechargeable pen for the iPad Pro.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.600]   This has a year-long battery
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   and you'd presumably replace the battery
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   as you do with some other styluses.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.840]   Alex is a professional who does this kind of work 3D work
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.160]   and photo work.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.800]   Is it attractive to you?
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.640]   - Yeah, it's very attractive.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.680]   I have the Surface 3,
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.600]   I'm very happy with the Surface 3.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.120]   And I got it specifically because I needed it.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.600]   I wanted something with a real operating system
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.440]   and I need to say it that way,
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.480]   but the iOS is not a real operating system.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.440]   I mean, it's a consumer operating system.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.240]   So I wanted something that I could actually put
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.080]   stuff like Photoshop on
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.400]   and then also be able to have a touchscreen.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.920]   And I really didn't feel like, I feel like Apple,
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.720]   I understand the Apple way of doing this
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.520]   and the need for making sure
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.960]   that they really thought through the touch thing.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.520]   But I'd be happy with just a screen that I could touch.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.480]   I don't need them to do anything to it.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.040]   Just where I put my,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.800]   if anyone's ever used a touchscreen capable
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.080]   my Mac or whatever, where they put a Surface over it
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.920]   and make it touchable,
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.120]   that's really all I need and I'd be happy.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.240]   But it's one of the big reasons
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.240]   that I moved to the Surface 3.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.560]   But it's also for the PC stuff that I do
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.240]   in some of the stuff that I have to go back and forth
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.560]   rather than dual booting my machine.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.040]   It's just nice to have a little surface
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.880]   that I can use.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.440]   And so I'm very tempted.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.760]   I don't know if I'm ready to,
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.800]   I didn't get my Surface 3 too long ago,
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.240]   so I'll probably hang on to it for a little while.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.840]   But I've been very, very happy with it.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.960]   And if I didn't have it, I'd be very tempted to get this one.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.880]   - What do you think, Renee?
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.480]   - I like what Microsoft's been doing.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.360]   I mean, I liked it for a long time
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.760]   when they made the original Lumia.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.200]   It was not at all like an iPhone
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.920]   and that I think is always an advantage.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.640]   If I don't want an iPhone, I don't want an iPhone
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.000]   in the same way if I don't want a MacBook.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.160]   I don't want a MacBook.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.280]   And I like that they, it's really weird
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.680]   that the biggest software company in the world
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.840]   is becoming innovative with hardware, not becoming.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.840]   They've been doing it for years now.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.400]   And sort of whether they win or lose,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.680]   they evolve the language.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.400]   Everyone's got flatter interfaces now
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.040]   and everyone is doing sort of more hybrid like devices now.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.480]   And whether this one is good or not,
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.920]   I don't know, I haven't had a chance to try it.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.240]   Like Andy has or not.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   But I still like when I compare Google,
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.840]   the last Google event to this,
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.480]   this to me is way more interesting.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.640]   The stuff that Microsoft is doing
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.840]   is way more interesting.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.320]   And I'm super happy as a consumer,
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.240]   just to have those additional options.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.800]   - The ordering page is now gone up at surface.com.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.840]   And we now can see the pricing options.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.480]   And whoo, starts at $14.99.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.640]   But for that you get 128 gig high drive
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.240]   and I-5 and an 8 gigabyte.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.240]   - You choose expensive.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.080]   - If you want to go up to the top of the line,
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   $2,700, 1.6 pounds though, 12 hour battery life.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.760]   It includes the Surface Pen.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.220]   We weren't sure about that.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.560]   They're very high res screen.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.440]   And with this you get an NVIDIA,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.440]   a dedicated NVIDIA GPU as well as a 512 gig.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.000]   I don't see the terabyte size,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.520]   it drives 512 gig drive at 16 gigs of RAM.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.920]   If you want 16 gigs of RAM,
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.440]   you're gonna be spending $2,700.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   That's a lot of money, but it's Mac money, right?
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.760]   Isn't it?
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.200]   - It is. - That's the same market.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.040]   - I mean, I travel with the MacBook Air,
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.880]   with the 11 in. - A little baby.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.280]   - I need the real light thing to travel
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.960]   because just the amount of travel I do
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   means I have really the need to travel light.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.320]   I have to pair down my options
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.640]   and it also has to be a bit more creative
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.040]   if you have less options.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.240]   It makes you have to be creative
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.840]   and have to think about how you're gonna do things.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.300]   So for me, I wanna have three pounds.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.920]   - It's not three pounds, it's under two pounds.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.280]   - You can take the keyboard off and just take the panels
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.160]   and that would be a tablet. - Right, then it's a tablet.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.000]   - Yeah.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   - But if you remember that,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.440]   it might not be very studly for,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.920]   it becomes a high performance machine,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.480]   like it becomes a $2,000 machine
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.040]   when it's connected to the keyboard
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.560]   'cause it's not against, it's a GPU in there,
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.560]   not just the battery.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.200]   When to, if the Surface 4 is fast enough
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.320]   for what you do in Photoshop, though, that's fine.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.720]   - Yeah.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.120]   - Really, I mean, I don't mean to make this
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.560]   a Microsoft show, but it is gonna be the big story of the day.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.080]   And-- - I mean, it's nice.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.400]   It's nice to compare things too.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.680]   I mean, one of the other things I really liked was
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.160]   they upgraded the keyboard cover for the Surface
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.840]   and Alex, you can actually use this new keyboard cover
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.800]   with the old one.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.600]   And I'll be damned if the keys on that thin keyboard cover
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.800]   for the Surface 3 and 4 aren't about as good
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.600]   as what I have here on my MacBook Pro.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.080]   Given that I've always complained about the stupid flat
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.960]   keyboard on the MacBook Pro,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.840]   but it's like the rest of the old keyboard cover
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.600]   was really flat keys, really chunky, really square.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.640]   You could certainly use it,
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.480]   but it wasn't what you'd call really comfortable experience.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.720]   It felt like I was using a real notebook keyboard.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.760]   And I haven't had the chance yet to try the iPad Pro
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.120]   keyboard cover, but I'd be surprised.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.240]   I've used fabric covered covers like keyboards
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.560]   like that before, and they're fine, they're kind of okay,
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.880]   but they're nothing like, the ones that I've used
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.360]   have been nothing like the new keyboard cover
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.800]   by Microsoft has.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.200]   Alex, you think this dims the, maybe some of the professional
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.240]   interest in the iPad Pro?
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   I don't know.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.040]   I mean, I think that there's a lot of people that are pretty,
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.440]   I mean, I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.560]   So there's, I think that I'm still interested in the iPad Pro
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.480]   as a professional.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.360]   I think that it's going to be really interesting to see.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.240]   I think a lot of folks like Chris in some ways
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.920]   are already using iOS, already using the Mac OS
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.480]   and not that interested in moving to Windows.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.920]   And so I think that for a lot of professional artists
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.520]   that are already in that realm, I think it's going to be
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.640]   something they're still very interested in.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.160]   I think that my guess is, and one thing that we'll have to see
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.760]   is how the printers, you know, how the pens both react
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.400]   because artists can be very, very sensitive to
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   exactly how that, so if the iPad Pro's pen performance
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.640]   is better than this, it will be a pretty quick decision
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.480]   for a lot of them.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.160]   Do we know the sample rate for the pen?
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.760]   Yeah, there's things like that we don't know
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.680]   and that you're absolutely right.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.160]   So how many inches is going to be behind your pen, you know?
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.320]   If you paint.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.680]   If you had to pick one company to do a right of the Apple.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.000]   And you know, I look at things like Adobe Max yesterday,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.160]   Adobe announced some really nice iOS apps,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.720]   really moving Adobe Photoshop and other apps
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.600]   kind of more towards a touch-first interface.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.280]   It perfectly makes sense on a photography side
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.640]   to be able to touch what you're doing.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.280]   Just paint in some adjustments into a picture.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.520]   That is, on a screen is just so much more intuitive
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.440]   than going through this intermediary thing
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.320]   of a trackpad or a mouse or even a tablet
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.480]   that's lying next to your computer.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.520]   Always have this translation work between
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.640]   moving something here and something is happening here
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.000]   on the screen and with a tablet, yeah, touch it.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.200]   And I think that is really appealing.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.240]   I have to say that--
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.080]   I think that also it's--
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.720]   Don't you at this point, Alex, feel like, gosh,
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   I wish Apple had an eraser on the pencil.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.720]   It's like, that's a huge--
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.520]   like, miss.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.480]   I mean, the Wacom's have an eraser.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.280]   That's what Apple does.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.160]   I mean, they do a version one and then there's a version two
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.120]   and that has the eraser and everyone's going to be, hey,
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.080]   hey, you're going to be an eraser.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.360]   So, yeah, I don't--
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.200]   I don't-- you know, I've had Wacom's tablet
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.680]   almost since they were built.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.800]   And they have erasers, right?
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.400]   And they have erasers and I never use them.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   No, OK.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.000]   So it's always kind of weird because it's
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   in a different state than I want it to be in all the time.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.960]   And so I just never use it.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.880]   So that makes sense.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.240]   Apple just--
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.040]   Wouldn't bother me that much.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.540]   Sure.
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.200]   Like, shape to face.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.800]   The one thing I'll say is that I think that a lot of business
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.600]   folks will also really like both with the iPad Pro, which
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.880]   they're going to push pretty hard, probably,
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.640]   and also with any of the surfaces.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.200]   But you're going to be able to easily mark up paper, like,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.000]   when you're working on slide decks and when you're working
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.040]   on PDFs and so on and so forth.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.320]   I think a lot of those technologies, for a lot of companies,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.760]   are a little far behind.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.160]   But as those catch up, being able to do that
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.160]   is a real piece where you start to replace paper.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.240]   But of course, you know, response rate
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.280]   is the thing that, you know, the latency is oftentimes
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.320]   the real problem in that area.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.160]   But Microsoft has that technology.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.840]   I remember a few years ago, I've seen a tech demo by Microsoft
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.640]   where they had, I don't know, a super high sample rate.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.080]   And it apparently was really, really quick and fast
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.840]   and very-- like when you put on an Oculus Rift today,
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.480]   the tracking is so good now.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.320]   That kind of tracking--
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   It's not key.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.400]   That is key.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.360]   And I know that Microsoft does have the technology.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.080]   So I think we might be seeing something in here.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.600]   I think I'll get the i7, but the smaller memory
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.040]   and the smaller drive, because that's a $700.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.160]   $600 jump.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.040]   Big difference.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.040]   So it looks like the sweet spot is really the $2,099,
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.040]   which is still a lot of money version of this thing.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.160]   Well, all right, enough.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.600]   We could talk a little bit about the Microsoft phones,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.640]   which were very impressive.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.320]   They brought that PureView camera back.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.000]   They introduced that-- no key introduced that with the 808.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.640]   Remember the 41 megapixel 808 and then the 1020.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.160]   The PureView brand remains.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.280]   The new camera's 20 megapixels.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.640]   They didn't talk a whole lot about micron size or lens
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.120]   elements and all of that.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.640]   But there's a pretty good heritage for the camera
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.120]   in the Lumia phones.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.200]   So are those 20 actual megapixels?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.320]   Or do they do like sub pixels now and do the pixel binning
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.080]   that they did before?
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:04.080]   Oh, no.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   They didn't talk about that at all.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.920]   The 950, 950 XL are fairly aggressively priced.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.480]   The 950 starts at $549, the 950 XL at $649,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.480]   which is the same price concept.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.600]   And the Qualcomm is water cooled, which is unusual.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.640]   Is it a Snapdragon in there?
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.120]   Yeah, well, I don't know if it's a Snapdragon.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.920]   I didn't check the branding, but they were all talking
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920]   about how it's a water cooled--
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920]   Yeah, they're water cooled, which is--
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.960]   Yeah, in a phone?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.160]   Apparently, I didn't know this.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.960]   The surface has water cooling, so this is their same technology.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.240]   It's interesting to see what the heat problem might be,
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.240]   because a big part of the demo was them saying, well,
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.960]   if you don't even want to travel with a laptop,
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.120]   if you just-- you can plug this into a keyboard,
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.200]   you can plug this into a screen, and then you get,
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.160]   essentially, the full Windows 10 experience only
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.840]   without the legacy desktop stylapse.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.280]   And it's fast, it's fluid.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.400]   It's not like you get a blown up phone screen.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.360]   It really does look like you're using a Windows laptop,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.920]   whether someone would rather travel with a docking--
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.560]   a little hockey puck-sized Apple TV style docking station
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.920]   so that they can plug in a screen and plug in a keyboard
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.240]   and a Bluetooth mouse when they get there.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   I don't know, but it works nicely for what it does.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.320]   The real problem, of course, with Windows Phone
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.680]   is a beautiful operating system.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.640]   The hardware has been, in some cases, really superb,
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.040]   is the lack of apps.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.800]   Google's refused to do apps for the Windows Phone,
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.120]   and that's kind of kept me out of the game.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.800]   But this is a real test of the new Microsoft strategy
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:39.160]   of one program running on all of its Windows devices.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.120]   And the Universal Windows app-- so yeah, it is an 810.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.360]   Remember the 810 had horrible overheating problems.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.680]   HTC decided not to use it for that reason.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.520]   I think that's why the Nvidia stuff is increasingly
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.080]   popular with Android.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.560]   I don't think Qualcomm just can't keep up.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.480]   I think they were flummoxed and flat-footed when Apple went 64-bit.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.880]   And I think if they're not careful,
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.640]   Nvidia is going to do to them, what Intel did AMD?
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.600]   This is-- Microsoft's market share is 3.5%.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.200]   It's kind of almost sad to see such nice hardware running
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.880]   an operating system that is just, unfortunately, too little.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.320]   It's also really weird that the guy--
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.560]   and I had a hard time listening to him because he came across
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.400]   as such a salesman.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.760]   Like, we have USB-C.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.760]   USB-C.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.360]   And he spent three minutes introducing
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.720]   what was essentially the iPhone 4S antenna, which
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.640]   I think is really strange.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.040]   Yeah, a tunable antenna.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.240]   Gee, where have I seen that before?
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.880]   And there are so many interesting features.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.640]   I would have just not mentioned that at all.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.080]   Yeah, right.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.840]   Well, they've put a very Microsoft thing in there,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.120]   a dedicated camera button.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   Apple would never do that.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.160]   Yeah, I do like that.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.200]   But that's something the Lumia phones, most Lumia phones
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:41.760]   have had.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.800]   They left it off on a couple of recent models,
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.640]   and people were upset.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.400]   So I'm glad they brought that back.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.640]   And a triple LED.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.520]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.920]   Two is good, three must be better.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   One more than Apple.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.680]   Windows Phone makes me kind of sad, because as you said,
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.720]   they really decided to do something completely different.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.640]   But it was just too late to get on the market.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.000]   And I think there's really not much hope at this point.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.640]   For it, Microsoft's going to continue to do it, of course.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.240]   So there you go.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.200]   A little analysis of what Microsoft announced
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   and how it impacts Apple.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.000]   But there's a lot of Apple stuff to talk about.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.800]   We're going to do that in just a moment.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.120]   Renee Richie is here from iMore.com.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.600]   He's got blisters on his fingers.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.080]   Too late.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.960]   There's so many blisters.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.040]   Broke the 4 million word mark.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.440]   Right?
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:33.960]   4 million?
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.640]   Was that right?
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.120]   Amazing.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.280]   I don't even know how you do that.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.400]   I need to be put down.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:38.960]   Obvious.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.480]   [SIGHS]
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.640]   Not just for one article, folks.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.760]   Don't worry.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.280]   That's his total output.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.560]   And iMore.com.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.160]   Alex Lindsay also here from Washington,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   DC, the nation's capital, where he'll
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.960]   be appearing on CNN and then later on.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   I feel like I should have a suit now.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.460]   No.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.000]   I want analysis.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.640]   Exactly.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.080]   Also here from New York, New York,
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.480]   where he's just come from the Microsoft event.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.800]   And thank you for doing that, Andy.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.880]   I know you had to leave a little early, Andy and not go.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.640]   Where are you?
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.120]   I am actually at a co-working space that might be--
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.080]   Assuming the Wi-Fi stays stable, it
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   might be my pick of the week.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.120]   Nice.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.160]   It's nice to have somewhere like that.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.920]   I put Paul up at the Yale Club.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.880]   I didn't realize you guys could have been roommates.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.120]   I know you were going.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:24.560]   Oh, well.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.480]   [LAUGHS]
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.920]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.760]   Now I notice that up to you in the days before I ever--
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.320]   I'm going to be-- can I cover your Comic Con this week
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.200]   on this week in Texas?
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:37.560]   Yes.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.400]   I owe you a little something-something.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.120]   After that.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.760]   And Chris Markwar, who is here in studio with us,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.600]   normally in Germany, at the viewfinder villa.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.440]   Got it right this time.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.160]   The viewfinder villa, that's right.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.280]   A new place.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.320]   Looks really sweet.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:52.920]   That's amazing.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.440]   It's nice.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   And you're doing workshops there.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.680]   It's an over 100-year-old brownstone building.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.520]   We have two floors.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.800]   We have four dedicated rooms for workshops and things.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.880]   We have a dark room, actually.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.480]   We're setting up our analog stuff again,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.520]   our film photography.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.280]   Oh, good.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.280]   We have a digital suite.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.360]   We have a seminar room.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:08.720]   So--
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.640]   Well, isn't Hanover where Seabit is?
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.080]   Yes, it is.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.760]   We might have an excuse to come visit you.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.680]   Well, yeah, we were welcome.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.160]   Mm.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.960]   I think that's the biggest computer show in the world, Seabit.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.800]   Well, I think they have a dedicated, huge building
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.760]   just for that show that doesn't do anything
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.360]   for the rest of the years.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.640]   Yeah, that's the Seabit building.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.120]   The Seabit.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.520]   I used to be there a lot.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.040]   I bet.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.520]   And one of my previous lives.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.400]   Yes, when you were an engineer.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.280]   Our show today brought to you by, of course, a company that's
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.680]   going to help you get your new phone.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.400]   Gazelle, are you sitting there with an old iPhone
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:48.280]   and just pining for the iPhone 6S?
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.200]   You know, it may be more affordable and more available
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.720]   than you think.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.040]   If you go to gazelle.com right now with your old phone,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.600]   you might just get a quote.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.560]   That's the way to do it.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.600]   Just find out how much your old phone's worth.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.920]   That quote's guaranteed for 30 days,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.800]   which means you have plenty of time to decide, buy, install,
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.240]   get running, do the works.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:16.080]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, gazelle.com.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.880]   And by the way, they not only buy, they sell at gazelle too.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.720]   In fact, they'll sell you a new old phone if you want.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.280]   Certified pre-owned phones.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.440]   They're all thoroughly tested through their 30 point
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.120]   inspection.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.520]   They also-- everything's functional.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.040]   The screen looks great.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.880]   They have different levels of quality.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.320]   There's certified like new.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.120]   There's slightly used, slightly worn, loved.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.600]   We say a loved phone.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.440]   But if the kids or you break your phone,
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.600]   this is a great way to get a new one.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.080]   Shipping is free for most items.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.080]   Gazelle, when you're selling it, will even provide you
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.480]   with a box so you can just pack it in.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.200]   In fact, why don't you do everything?
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.920]   Get everything out of those drawers.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.360]   Get some cash and then figure out
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.040]   what you want to buy next.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.720]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, gazelle.com.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.440]   They'll pay you with a check, PayPal credit,
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.560]   if you're in a hurry.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.840]   Or if you want a little extra and you shop on Amazon,
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.880]   get the Amazon gift card.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.840]   They'll bump the value of your offer by 5%.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:21.400]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, gazelle.com.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:27.440]   So Renee, Richie, you have released now your official iPhone 6S.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.960]   Was it a 6S or 6S Plus review or both?
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.680]   I did the 6S Plus for entities doing the 6S.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.200]   I think this is the phone, isn't it?
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.640]   6S Plus.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.520]   I really like it.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.120]   Battery life is astounding.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.040]   I can now say that having had it for a week.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.600]   However I've used this, I've yet to kill it.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.760]   I've left mine off the charge right night just to test it.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.840]   It drops about 4%.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.080]   And I still have almost a third of it left.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.520]   Apple really knows what they're doing in terms of keeping
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.480]   the consumption to a minimum.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   Because this is actually a smaller battery than last year.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.880]   Yeah, they had to fit the Taptic Engine in.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.360]   So there was slightly less battery geometry
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.080]   in it than last time.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.240]   Anything we haven't found out that you discovered for this review,
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.520]   anything we ought to know about?
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.480]   And there's lots of just really clever,
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.920]   especially in the 3D touch segment.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.560]   There's just so much that works off 3D touch.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.640]   Now even if you go to Safari and you hit Print,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   you can peek into the preview of the Print
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.360]   and then pop in and you get a full PDF of that page
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.960]   that you can then share directly from the Force Touch interface.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.040]   It's just, there's so much, it's one of those things
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.200]   like iOS 9 where when Apple talked about it,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.560]   they gave you five or six or seven or eight bullet points.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.640]   And you're kind of like, yeah, okay, that's nice.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.640]   But then when you go and use it, you just start discovering more
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.720]   and more stuff and how all of those small things works together.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.200]   And it really makes for a better experience.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.280]   It's not just a bigger, it's much better.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:54.000]   Does 3D touch learn?
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.560]   Somebody sent me an email saying,
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.280]   it seems to be better as I use it.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.320]   Like it knows better what offers, what pop ups to do.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   I mean, I know for sure the first thing I,
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.520]   well, it wasn't the first thing,
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.560]   but one of the early things I figured out was in my favorites,
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.920]   the top three favorites are always going to show up
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.080]   when I 3D touch the phone icon.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.960]   So I rearranged my favorite so that I'd easily be able
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.920]   to get to the top three people I'd want to call.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.960]   Messages seems to remember people, where is it?
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   There it is.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.960]   Messages seems to remember people you've messaged recently.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.600]   That doesn't, that doesn't really compute for me.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.440]   The, the selection on the messages for us touch for me
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.040]   seems completely random.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.320]   So it has an algorithm.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.520]   It's very similar to how it works in the minus one homepage,
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.880]   the series search homepage, where it tries to do it
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.720]   based on time of day frequency and recency.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.600]   So if you typically--
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.120]   Oh, it's trying to outsmart me, okay.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.080]   Oh, so it's actually saying, oh, you usually do these people
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:50.560]   at this time.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   At this time, wow.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.320]   So even if you don't text Lisa all the time,
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.960]   but it knows you always text her in the morning,
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.960]   it's going to try to make sure she's there for the morning.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.640]   Oh, that makes a lot more sense now.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.520]   So there is some learning involved.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:01.800]   It wasn't obvious though.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.000]   Yeah, so it's time and also location based.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.040]   So if it knows that you tend to do something in one location
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.560]   more than the other, it'll try to promote that in that location.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.000]   Interesting.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.400]   Do commands change?
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   Find the very slow learner though.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.000]   Say again?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.400]   I would just say I find to be a very slow learner though.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.400]   There's some apps that I only ever use,
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.440]   like at the, at the commuter rail station.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.960]   And I've been using this phone for about a week,
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.520]   and not once has it actually surfaced that app
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.520]   at the commuter rail station.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.760]   So, OK.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.000]   Of course it helps as well.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.760]   If you have a certain regularity in your life,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.320]   if you're like all over the place like I am,
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.800]   it doesn't really do anything.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.160]   Right, right.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.080]   Having regularity.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.280]   Developers are starting to integrate it too,
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:39.840]   which is really nice.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.600]   There's more and more.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.200]   And like for example, Smule just put a version of Magic Piano.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:43.720]   Oh, nice.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.840]   It uses pressure sensitivity for the music playing.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.360]   That's nice.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.240]   So we're getting there.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.840]   Yeah, so the only one I-- oh, by the way, find my iPhones great
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.600]   because it gives you your foremost recent devices.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.560]   But the only third party I know of is Instagram,
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.680]   but I think that's a great one.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.760]   And it does it not only when you force touch or 3D touch
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.800]   the icon, but actually within the program, for instance,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.680]   if you-- and I think we mentioned this before,
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.360]   but you 3D touch the person's name,
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.680]   you'll get their most recent images.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.280]   I mean, this is--
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.040]   It's nice.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.280]   I would love to see this in more apps.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.280]   So Smule has a lift of them.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:19.880]   Yes, they do.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.360]   The access is horizontal.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.400]   Yeah, so there's Dropbox and there's
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.720]   a variety of other apps that have put it in already.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.960]   Nice.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.840]   Let me see what Dropbox works.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.560]   It's really a mental convenience
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.880]   because tapping the camera icon and then tapping selfie
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.680]   is not really faster than tapping the camera icon
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.120]   and tapping the flip button.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.960]   But it's the same thing like keyboard shortcuts.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.280]   It's the way our brain registers the processes.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.880]   They don't really count it as two separate acts.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.880]   So it just feels faster to us.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.040]   I've heard of people who now put the camera back
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.760]   on the front page, on the home page,
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.480]   because when they touch the button,
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.080]   it opens up so quickly they can't actually slide up
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.000]   for the camera.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.040]   And in addition to that, they can then
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.480]   decide if they want to shoot a video, which originally
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.760]   they would have slid up for.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.120]   Right.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.760]   And then side-swiped the video.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.040]   You have to relearn it.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.840]   But this is quicker, apparently.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.680]   You go in, you press the-- you force touch the camera
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.320]   and then you go--
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.480]   I guess if you got used to turning on the screen
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.600]   with the on/off switch, you still could do that.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.840]   The speed is ridiculous.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.160]   I registered a different finger.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.480]   I don't use this one.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.840]   Ah, clever.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.360]   So you have one finger that is unknown.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.200]   Several, but I'm not going to tell you which.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:26.720]   And you used--
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.640]   So if I did this with the pinky, I'd be able to--
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.640]   Oh.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.560]   Oh, the pinky, right.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.400]   And the speed of the device in general,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.200]   I mean, Apple gave figures for how fast it is.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.800]   But when you start using it, everything
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.520]   from the Touch ID to Siri to app launching,
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.080]   to transitions, when you pull down
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.320]   the notification center, all of that,
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.480]   it's really interesting to see what Apple's
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.520]   done with their chipsets.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.960]   Because we're talking about Qualcomm before,
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.680]   Apple doesn't have to support both Microsoft and Google's
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.480]   platforms, DirectX and OpenGL.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.640]   They don't have to do all that.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.920]   They can make this chip just hardware
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.920]   coded exactly for what they want to do.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.440]   And they can just put as much technology as they want behind it
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.080]   because they don't have to sell it at a profit.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.120]   They don't have to worry about the whole phone profit.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.640]   So they're making incredibly fast chipsets.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.040]   And it just-- it flies on these iPhones.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.440]   They really does feel remarkably faster.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.240]   And more than even the 1.8 times faster
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:19.200]   than the Apple quotes for the GPU.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.280]   I mean, the CPU.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.840]   Yeah, it really does feel snappy.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.120]   I got--
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   It's called Twister this year.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.440]   So we can make it all the joke.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:26.920]   Twister.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.000]   Twister.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.200]   Anything else from the review that we don't know about here?
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.040]   Just the-- I mean, the cameras, I was--
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.240]   Oh, yeah, let's talk about the camera.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.920]   I've had great images.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.200]   I think I feel very good about the quality images.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.880]   And of course, we've got Chris Markward here.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.800]   Have you been playing with the new success?
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.480]   Well, I get a 6S.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.480]   And I'm completely happy with the camera.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.320]   I've heard that the 6S Plus is even better.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.520]   And it's kind of why, yes, of course.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.720]   But from what I've done, and I've tested video,
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.320]   I mean, the video stabilization in the 6S
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.720]   is so aggressive now that it's almost--
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.480]   it's over that point where it feels good to me.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.960]   I think I want it to be a bit more shaky.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.640]   It's a feel kind of almost--
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.160]   You play the video.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.000]   Artificial, yeah.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.800]   It's a bit like you're walking through molasses.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.120]   I want that a bit more shake, actually.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.480]   I want to wait to switch it back to dial it back just slightly.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.320]   Do you have a video on iMOR as a site that we can show?
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.640]   Yeah, if you go to the camera section,
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.600]   there's a picture of Georgia, and you can click that.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.800]   And it'll play the video of iPhone 6 Plus
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.720]   versus iPhone 6S Plus video stabilization.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   It's not very long, but it's--
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:37.600]   Is the optical image stabilization that much better
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.000]   than the one on the 6S?
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.800]   Well, you'll see on the video, it's not that it's better.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   It's just incredibly smooth.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.600]   It's less artificial, I think.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.800]   OK, that's what I was wondering about, not as artificial.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.120]   It's Georgia Dow.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.600]   So the left is the 6 Plus, and the right is the 6S Plus.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.040]   Yeah, that's a significant difference.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.880]   Significant difference there.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.440]   But when you shot that, you didn't really
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.360]   make an effort to hold it still, right?
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.480]   I just picked it up and walked.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.200]   Wow.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   Yeah, maybe--
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.680]   So just imagine not the gimbal, some sort,
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.560]   like these little digital things.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.320]   That'll be--
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.440]   I don't need a gimbal anymore.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.360]   I bought a gimbal.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.640]   I don't need a gimbal anymore.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.200]   And I actually did go out, and I forgot to bring it today.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.040]   Showed it yesterday on iOS today.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:29.120]   But Shuram now makes a lightning microphone, the SM88.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.240]   Yes, that is unbelievable.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.440]   It's got two capsules, condenser capsules.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.720]   You can rotate it, and then you can set it in the settings
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.840]   on the phone.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.480]   You can tell it how you want one rear-facing, one forward-facing.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.560]   Do you want cardioid?
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.240]   Do you want omnidirectional?
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.320]   And the quality superb-- this is now, I think--
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.800]   this is a filmmaking device.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.920]   I mean, this is really remarkable with a good--
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.800]   You see the story today about the Swiss television
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.960]   studio that's switched to iPhones?
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.400]   Yeah, the French Swiss studio, who I think
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.400]   laid off their camera people.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.560]   Now, they gave the reporters--
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.480]   Oh, that's sad.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.200]   --selfie sticks and iPhones.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.360]   And now they are doing it all themselves.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.400]   That's very sad.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.600]   I've been very happy.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.240]   The low light performance-- this is, again, of the 6S Plus.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.960]   It's been great.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.600]   Lots of detail.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.280]   It feels fairly refined.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.120]   This is a low light picture.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.520]   And I took your advice, Renee, and I'll repeat it,
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.840]   for those who don't know.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.960]   For low light, turn off live photos,
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.000]   you're going to get a better picture, right, Renee?
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.160]   Yeah, because it's not capturing video at the same time
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.080]   that it's not capturing a whole bunch of frames at once.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.560]   It's just concentrating on that one frame.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   I was also finding at the event today
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.800]   that it was focusing a lot faster
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.640]   once I turned off live pictures.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.840]   Just I'm only been using it as a camera for the past three,
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.240]   four days, but I'm already trying to figure out,
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.000]   is it worth to keep live pictures turned off
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.920]   unless you think that there is a good reason
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.240]   to have it turned on?
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.680]   Because it's not the first time that--
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.960]   also, now that I'm looking at all the pictures I've
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.840]   been taking over the past three or four days,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   very few of them are actually enhanced by live picture.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.640]   It's such a short thing.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.440]   Well, also because there has to be stuff happening
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.840]   in order for it to be interesting.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.080]   Otherwise, it's more like, here's a few seconds of me
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.240]   stabilizing the camera before I actually take a picture.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.640]   I realize, I do kind of a utility thing that I do
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.160]   is to take pictures of anybody who gives me a business card.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.440]   I take a picture because I lose their parts almost immediately.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.040]   And I realized, I took me a little while to register that,
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.360]   oh, right, I have these little live photos of me taking pictures.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.960]   Yeah, just shaky camera photos.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.360]   But the quality seems to be very-- these are all
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.520]   brought daylight pictures.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.520]   I was at the Getty Museum on Friday,
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.240]   and so I took a lot of images.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.280]   But I think some of the images I got,
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.920]   I feel are as good as an image I might have taken with a DSLR.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.400]   I mean, I really--
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.520]   I'm very happy with some of the quality--
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.160]   Oh, it's full light.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.160]   That is amazing.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.280]   Well, and at least in the future update,
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.720]   I think in 9.1, apparently they're going to fix the--
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:14.040]   take the camera down, show the taking the camera down
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.440]   after the live video.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.440]   Yeah, I have a lot of--
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.280]   You have to relearn.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.120]   You have to relearn.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.240]   Way too many of those.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.600]   So this is a picture I took illicitly as it turned out.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.560]   I took it, and then it was told by the guard you're not--
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.200]   and the Getty is nice because you could take pictures
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.240]   of the paintings, except some paintings, apparently, you can't.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.400]   You can press that and sell it now.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.200]   This is a Picasso I've never seen.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   And it's a very-- apparently, very rare Picasso.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.040]   It was in a private collection.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.320]   So this is inside, and not perfect light,
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.320]   although the Getty is a very light museum.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.200]   But I feel like you can see the brush strokes.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.840]   You can see the detail in ways.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.240]   Just remarkable, frankly.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.040]   It's a Christmas point.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.200]   The thing with the live photos that I think confuses people
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.520]   is they treat it like a tiny video where you press the button,
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.000]   and then you expect to get three seconds, where it's really--
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.240]   you press the button, and you get 1.5 before and 1.5 after.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.080]   So you just have to mentally fix that idea that you're
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.880]   taking a still photo that later will happen to animate,
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.400]   and then you'll get much better results.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.760]   What I found a bit disappointing with the live pictures
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.840]   is that in the keynote, they showed them quite fluid.
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.240]   And they're not always, aren't they?
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.640]   They're like 10 to 12 frames a second, I think.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.920]   They can be a little jerky.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.760]   They're 15 max.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.480]   That was a bit of a letdown, I think.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.720]   Here's a very-- a tough picture because it's bright sky.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.800]   I mean, you might have used a polarizer-graduated filter
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.360]   on this.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.120]   But you know that Apple does all sorts of processing now,
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.200]   including detecting what type of stuff is in the pictures.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.720]   So they will now treat the sky different from the grass,
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   for example.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.120]   There's one of those.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.040]   There's one of those.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.280]   Just putting the camera down after I shoot the life.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.080]   I got a lot of those.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.760]   I actually-- I do turn it off now.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.840]   And I think it-- I think turn it on when you think you're
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.400]   going to want it.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.840]   There's some things that lend themselves to it.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.400]   But yeah, this is-- and I presume
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.800]   I have auto HDR turned on.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.840]   I don't know if this has the HDR on or not.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.080]   I think it'll show you.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:03.960]   It should show you.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.560]   It should not.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:04.720]   It should not.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.200]   It's somewhere.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.080]   I wish it would indicate live photo as well.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.120]   It only does that on the share screen.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.240]   If you hover over it.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:09.920]   No, no.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.440]   If you remove the lower third, you can see--
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.920]   If you hover it right down--
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.560]   You're not on the Mac, yeah.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.240]   This is on El Capitan.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.280]   Of course, you have to have El Capitan on a Macintosh.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.320]   I just-- I'm very happy.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.080]   There's certainly the daylight imagery quality superb.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.880]   And Andy was saying, weekend and week,
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.840]   out both with the 4K and the 12 megapixels,
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.960]   it lets you crop and do all sorts of other things
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.920]   to that image if you don't need all of those pixels.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.520]   I find myself switching between the live pictures
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.000]   and the non-life pictures frequently, actually,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   because when I shoot a picture of a price tag of receipt
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.840]   or something, I'm not going to need the live picture.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.400]   But then if I'm among people, I kind of want that.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.040]   I wish they had on the force touch,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.280]   they had a button that says, with live pictures
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.320]   and non-life pictures.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:00.960]   Just to--
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.480]   To a remain with thing, I was using the digital zoom
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.080]   in front of the New York Public Library yesterday.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.520]   And notice something that with the--
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.520]   when you use the digital zoom on the new 12 megapixel sensor,
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.560]   not only do you get more detail, but it will, of course,
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.320]   try to up sample the image.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.640]   So you wind up with a 12 megapixel image.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.320]   And sometimes it looks a lot better.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.400]   Oftentimes, it gives you sort of a slightly watercolor
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.920]   sort of effect that you may or may not like.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.720]   But it's certainly better than what you get
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.680]   in the digital zoom on the iPhone 6 Plus.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.400]   I bought the 6 Plus and the 6S Plus with me here in this group.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.600]   I put this to the extreme on the 6S.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.280]   Holy cow.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.120]   Here's your zoom.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.040]   This is San Diego daylight.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:43.800]   The moon is out.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.480]   I have zoomed in all the way on live view
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.080]   and then cropped the picture as far as it could go.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.480]   Yeah, but get much worse than that.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.440]   There's not much detail left in that one.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.160]   But it kind of still shows you that you can get quite a lot
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.720]   out of the camera, even with digital zoom.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:03.160]   Now the moon, there's no point in trying to even do that
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.560]   with the smartphone unless you have a telescope in front of it.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.120]   But it's a nice little experiment, at least.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.640]   Here's an example of the kind of disappointing frame
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.480]   rate on the live photo.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.160]   Had I known this, I probably should have shot this as a video.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.360]   I wanted to capture the bubbles in the champagne going up.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.440]   And you can see that the frame rate is a little jerky.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.920]   So a video-- don't consider a live photo a replacement
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.160]   for a video, right?
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.320]   I wonder why during the keynote and in the marketing
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.400]   materials, they showed a faster frame rate.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.080]   Because I think that's--
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.000]   It did look pretty smooth.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.320]   Yeah, but that's not really Apple.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.720]   They were usually quite honest in advertising
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.760]   with showing the speed of how fast the animations are
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.240]   on the screens.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.480]   And that one is one of those things that--
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.760]   Is it possible right now that the camera does different
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.960]   frame rates depending on--
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.760]   Yeah, well, they say up to, I think, up to 15 frames per second.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.240]   So it is possible, depending on what
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.160]   all the phone is doing at the time, either when it's
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.760]   capturing it or playing it back.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.720]   It could also have something to do with how much light you have.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.560]   And I guess I'm shooting it when it's bright or dark.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.880]   Exposure to not.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.080]   This is-- I didn't bring a camera to Los Angeles.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.800]   I wanted to just force myself to use.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.160]   And this is an example of, boy, this
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.120]   would have been a great shot.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:14.920]   I have a good camera.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.840]   And I could have zoomed in on the light standards and the moon.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.880]   However, I have to say, for a camera in the dark,
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.440]   this is pretty impressive.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.240]   I've had a lot of shots over the last few days
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:30.760]   that I could not have taken with my 5S, which was my last phone.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.960]   And now, really dark, still detail, still something
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.800]   to see in the picture.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.040]   So alone, that is a pretty good change.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.200]   Yeah, it's really fun.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.880]   And you can do 1080p for the slow motion, at least the 120
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.440]   frame per second slow motion.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.400]   And the FaceTime camera, it went from 1.2 megapixels
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.800]   to 5 megapixels with the retina flash.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.680]   So all your live flash selfies look fantastic, Nellio.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:59.000]   I shoot 60 frames per second, 1080p.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.360]   Let me show you, just as an example, this is the sure microphone.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.000]   Let me-- should I do this one?
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.840]   This is the sure microphone, a little microphone test.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.000]   I wanted to see how-- could I do interviews?
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.800]   But you know--
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.680]   All right, so I'm talking to Jason--
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.680]   really is quite a good microphone.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.320]   I'm a so-- I'm behind the camera.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.240]   I'm interviewing him.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.920]   And I'm over here on the--
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.560]   oh, actually, no.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.600]   Oh, you want to be honest?
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.080]   Yeah, I just want to-- if you can hear me, really well.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.920]   I didn't have a set right for us off-axis rejection.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.560]   The other guy who's not in there--
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.840]   But I said, the poorly is very good.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.080]   And this is 60 frames, so it's very smooth, 1080p.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.200]   And the sound is--
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.320]   The sound is from that SM-88A from the sure, which I think
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.240]   is remarkable.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.120]   I mean, Alex, you always have been the one who said,
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.160]   I want to do really shooting CES.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.080]   Well, not just that.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.640]   It's a lot of history, you know?
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.160]   And I've--
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:50.160]   And I've--
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.080]   And I've been--
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.200]   And that's what I've been--
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.400]   I kind of moved to that.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.520]   We used to have camera crews and all kinds of other stuff.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:00.280]   And I really found that covering CES and NAB with my--
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.200]   with my mic and a headset mic was enough for me.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.960]   And I really didn't feel like I needed to go back.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.320]   So I think that a lot of this stuff, especially
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.600]   with good noise cancellation, I think
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.680]   that what really makes it work is XLR interfaces.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.120]   So there's a couple of interfaces that will take an XLR
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:16.800]   into an iPhone.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.520]   And I think that really turns up the notches a couple.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.160]   I think that the--
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:20.720]   I think you should try this.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   Sure.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.200]   I can't hold it.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:24.960]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.460]   You can't.
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.640]   But it's pretty directional.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.840]   I wonder if this is a live photo of these kitties.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.440]   I think it is.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:29.800]   But it's not--
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.080]   And Serenity, we just did a bunch of tests
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:34.120]   with the 4K camera cropping, zooming in 50 and 100%
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.720]   because we were thinking of doing the same thing
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.440]   when you can't get close enough to the products with an iPhone.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.040]   But then you can shoot it 4K and still get really good 1080p
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:41.960]   out of it.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.240]   You know where live photos great?
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.480]   Kids and animals.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.760]   Because--
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.600]   People living things in general.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.040]   The living thing, obviously living.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.000]   But kids, you can't say, hey, hold on.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.280]   Let me get the video going.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.120]   Not that you cannot pull any of those additional frames out.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:57.600]   I know.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.200]   You have a middle frame.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.360]   The rest is video.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:00.520]   It's--
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.320]   One thing interesting.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.840]   --in a moth container.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.720]   I turned on Google Photos for upload.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.480]   And Google Photos at first did not
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   know what to do with live photo.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.320]   Now it uploads to still.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.680]   And it uploads the MOV.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.080]   Oh, oh.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.920]   And it sees both, which is awesome.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.600]   Does it combine them in a way that makes sense?
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.920]   It doesn't combine them, but you now have the still
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.840]   and you have the MOV.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.960]   So that's better than nothing, right?
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.360]   And Apple's made an API for it.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.640]   So hopefully everyone will update it.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.400]   Yeah, at some point, somebody will see if I can--
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.440]   Because the video in front and behind the video,
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.560]   the shot is full resolution, right?
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.440]   Right.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.600]   So it should be possible.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:40.160]   So you can, in fact, see what these appear to be videos.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.360]   These are just the three second live photo videos
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.120]   that are just in there.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.200]   But the frame rate's terrible.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.000]   Yeah, up to 15 frames per second.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:51.760]   We'll disappointing.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.280]   I mean--
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.880]   Disappointed about a feature that we didn't have--
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.880]   I know, I know.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.880]   I know.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.800]   I have on 7, it'll be 30 frames per second.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.480]   And then we'll have--
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.040]   I have on 7, as it'll be 60 frames.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.720]   See my shaky Picasso.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.120]   The move at the end is when the guard came over and grabbed me.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.120]   So--
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.160]   Leo, how do I keto flip him?
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.040]   No, in all honesty, you can take pictures there.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:17.360]   And I just didn't know.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.760]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.720]   It's been thought, how many guts you have as a photographer?
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.720]   Because you know that you saw the side that said,
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.880]   no photography.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.000]   But you think, OK, I bet that means you can't take pictures.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.760]   But I bet that means they won't make me delete the one picture
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.760]   that I accidentally put.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.280]   Thank God.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.120]   Before they told me.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.320]   Thank God.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.000]   No, there was no sign that said no pictures.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.800]   It's just, I think, because it's a private collection painting
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.240]   mixed with the other-- because the Getty, which is amazing,
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.000]   you can take pictures.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.200]   You can take pictures of the Van Gogh irises.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.080]   Oh, lots of museums have switched to allowing pictures.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.200]   I love allowing pictures.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.960]   You know, it's good business.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.200]   You post it on Instagram.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.400]   People are going to come.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:58.160]   You're not going to replace the guidebook.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.000]   It's basically recommendation marketing.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.920]   You go somewhere, you show them the pictures.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.680]   You want to come.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   All right.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.440]   Anything else we want to talk about with a new phone?
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.920]   We've certified it two thumbs up.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:15.480]   If you really care, get the 6 Plus, 6S Plus, because of OIS.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.360]   It's too big for me.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   Because of OIS, because of better battery life,
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.720]   you really ought to just get the 6S Plus.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.040]   It's not that big.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.080]   I want to go the direction.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.560]   I had a 6 Plus, and I went to the 6.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.200]   But does it knock you really tiny?
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.320]   It does feel smaller, but I kind of like it.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.400]   So I can't decide.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.040]   I kind of carry them both around at the moment.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.880]   I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.680]   So I had this next to an iPhone 4S.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.120]   And you want it tiny?
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.640]   The iPhone 4S looks like it's something wrong with it.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.840]   You know, one thing--
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.440]   and I'm a fan of this.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.320]   Even the 6 is a bit too big for my taste, though.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:53.000]   And one thing I really have an issue with is I can't stand it
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.560]   on its side anymore.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.120]   Because I used to do this a lot as an ad hoc tripod.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.440]   You could put it somewhere on its side.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.640]   Hope, hope that it doesn't tumble.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.520]   Boy, we're really grasping at stress.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.560]   You know, the frame rate is only--
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.120]   and they can't stand it on its side anymore.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.520]   No, it's clearly the best iPhone Apple's ever made.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.080]   There's just no question about that.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.600]   And I guess if you don't--
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.440]   I love 3D touch so much.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.080]   You know, they sold me on that.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   I was so skeptical.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.600]   And it's only going to get better as more developers
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.920]   keep supporting it.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.360]   I think Renee talked about this earlier.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:30.160]   But it's like, I'm sort of instinctively shifting
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.320]   towards if there's something I want to do for an app.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.640]   Now it's becoming instinctive to force touch on the icon
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.000]   instead of tapping on it to see if the feature I want
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.120]   is actually right there for me.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.040]   And it's just brilliant, brilliant move forward.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.040]   Don't you feel just one feature?
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.120]   A little sad, though, when nothing happens.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:46.600]   It just goes--
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.280]   It shakes his head, though, a little bit at you.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.000]   It's a good move.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.440]   By the way, the force touch trackpad mode.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:52.840]   That is--
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.800]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.560]   --major, big thing for me.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.440]   I completely forgot about talking about it.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.040]   But this is really like you press in on a text.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.960]   You swipe back and forth on the keyboard.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.320]   And you get this moving cursor up there
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.840]   that you can then make a selection with it.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.120]   Such a boon.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.680]   That is really a big thing.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.920]   And I have to force myself to get used to it
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:12.760]   and use it, actually.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.280]   The mouse wrist.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:13.800]   Now I can't stop.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.360]   Press a little harder, and you can select the text
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:15.840]   at the same time.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.360]   Exactly.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.960]   That's a little hard to do.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.480]   I do it.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.600]   Well, yeah, OK.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.360]   And it's a bit of a--
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.400]   Ah, I've been able to--
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:22.880]   Now we're here.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.360]   Now we're here.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:23.720]   Now we're here.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   You get used to it once you do it.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.360]   You have to do practice editing.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.360]   [BUZZING]
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.000]   Now here we go.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.480]   Here we go.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.400]   Here's my selection.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.960]   Do I do it?
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.880]   Very blower at that a little bit so we can see it.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.600]   You can never get that to activate quite right.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.440]   Well, I mean, the fourth touch on its lightest setting,
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:46.200]   I think for me is still tiny little bit too strong.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:46.560]   A little--
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.960]   Yeah, I turn it to the lightest as well.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   And but still, I would like a super light setting.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.560]   Yeah, super light.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.200]   Just one further down.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.280]   That fourth touch is great.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.720]   But why don't we have a super light setting?
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.200]   Come on.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.720]   Good day.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.560]   I'm very weak.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.200]   Because we were teasing them when they
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.800]   said nothing has changed but everything.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.600]   But when you look at it, the casing, the glass, the cameras,
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.960]   the chip, the list of things that did change to this iPhone
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.920]   is pretty long when you stop and make it all out.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.800]   It's easily the largest S update ever.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.520]   I mean, there's nothing been comparable.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.040]   I did.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.280]   I mocked them.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.840]   I thought, oh, come on, everything.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.040]   But no, it's not those three features.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.520]   It's a lot of stuff.
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:26.040]   And as a group, it makes it--
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.240]   I would say it's one of the biggest iPhone upgrades ever.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.480]   Period it.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.200]   It makes me-- it makes me want to stop talking about the
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.400]   difference between a tick and a talk release at this point.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:35.920]   Yes.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.800]   It was just such a huge, huge improvement of the previous one.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.320]   It's the beginning of my review.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.000]   It's all your lead.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   I think the talk, no more.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.480]   But when you think about it, even though the S phones, you
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.360]   have stuff like Touch ID and Siri and now 3D Touch, they
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.800]   put things that quickly become part of your core interaction
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.000]   model in those releases.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.760]   And those things that linger long past
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.160]   their original introduction.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.120]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.520]   I'm glad we can have the camera guy here to talk about the--
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.480]   anything else you want to say about the iPhone camera?
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:08.320]   No.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.240]   Is it the best of all the camera phones?
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.480]   Of all the iPhones that I've used so far, no competition.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:16.960]   And you haven't tried the Lumia 1020 or the--
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:17.760]   I haven't.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.520]   But this one, I find myself using this way more often
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:24.560]   than any other camera for a few reasons.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:29.360]   The first one is it's just on much, much quicker than before.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.760]   So it's like, OK, swipe, click, done.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.080]   And the quick access through the Force Touch is amazing.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.360]   So shoot a video.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:39.440]   It's not open the camera, swipe.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.040]   The image quality, even on the 6S is good.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.160]   I haven't really tried the 6S plus yet.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:49.480]   But this is plenty good for stuff.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.280]   And even for some professional work, I would say.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.000]   Yeah, I mean, it was kind of a risk for me to go to LA
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.600]   and not take it my camera.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.520]   I mean, usually I'd want to take a lot of pictures.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.480]   But I wanted to give this a real shot.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.040]   I'm very happy with the images.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.560]   Oh, and you got the rose gold there?
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.320]   Oh, bro, we call it "bros gold."
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:05.840]   Rose gold.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.320]   I'm a manly.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.960]   Whoa, you just give me the raspberry there?
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:15.240]   I don't like the word "bros" as a free-fix brand.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.160]   And he doesn't like bro.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:20.640]   You're right.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.000]   It's rose gold or it's not pink, though.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   It's more than pink.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:24.880]   I don't see any gold.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.560]   I see pink.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.240]   Maybe it's my color perception.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.040]   Well, it's weird because we tested it under different lighting
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:30.800]   and it can look silver.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.520]   It can look gold.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.000]   It can totally look pink.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.960]   The only time it's pink is when you look straight on.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.560]   But isn't that gold looking right there, folks?
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.400]   Look, copper-y.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.440]   Yeah, that's because you have a yellow light back there.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:43.440]   You know?
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:44.080]   Shh.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.000]   Stay on the eye-lay.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.400]   OK, let's take a break.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.400]   And we'll come back.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.280]   One last thing to mention about this is I wrote in my review
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.200]   that I felt almost like the guy with the Lamborghini
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.040]   on the city street with these new radios
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.360]   because you've got 300 megabit per second LT,
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.720]   866 megabit per second Wi-Fi.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.120]   I can't even find a way to test this stuff anymore.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.440]   I get 100 down in my living room on LT.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.440]   I can't get anywhere near to 300.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.080]   I know.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.680]   I know.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.560]   Should I run a speed test to see what we're getting out?
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.600]   I'm glad we have it.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.920]   Like the guy who owns the Lamborghini,
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.000]   I'm super glad we have it, even if I can't use it.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.640]   I hope one day to be able to use it.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.600]   Yeah, well, you're in Canada.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.480]   You're not even supposed to have this phone right now.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.920]   We're supposed to have 20 by 2 lanes of LTE in Toronto,
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:26.120]   but the day I went there to test it,
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.880]   there was a Taylor Swift concert,
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.120]   and I could barely get on the tower.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.720]   All those selfies pouring up to the internet
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.640]   just ruined it for the rest of us.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.520]   Selfies at my side.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.480]   Let me run a speed test.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:41.200]   This is T-Mobile in Petaluma, which is actually pretty good.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.960]   I'm getting 109 on Rogers, but that's without--
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.480]   Wow.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.280]   --of the advanced--
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:44.680]   That is pretty--
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:44.880]   That is pretty--
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:45.800]   That's standard LTE, though.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.840]   That's not what the carrier is.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.720]   This is LTE, not LTE advanced.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.000]   I don't think I have that available in Petaluma.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.840]   Ping time, 49 millisecond.
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:59.480]   Anything over 30 megabits down is probably enough.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.840]   100 would be nice, right?
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.320]   Except for my data plan, I've gotten three warnings
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.800]   from Rogers testing this phone.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.720]   I doubled my usual.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.960]   So 34.2 megabits down.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:14.560]   But it's good because this is the most used computer
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.640]   now that you have.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.480]   Yeah, no, I want good data.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.640]   The laptop is secondary.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.120]   But it shouldn't be better than your home.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:20.680]   That's what it's--
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.520]   That's what we're going now.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.200]   That's what it's depressing.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.000]   That's what we're going now.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.600]   So look at that.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.600]   34 down, almost 20 up.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.640]   That is just fantastic.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.960]   I think I can live with that, yeah.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:29.960]   I could live with that.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.800]   Yes.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.160]   And that's T-Mobile in Petaluma.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.360]   There's not a lot of competition from other T-Mobileers
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:37.700]   here.
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.920]   Another place is it's not nearly as good.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:42.960]   Our show is brought to you by lynda.com.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.880]   K-lynda.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.280]   I love lynda.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:50.320]   The online learning platform, 3,900 on-demand video
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:54.720]   courses in every aspect of technology, but also business.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:57.520]   And hobbies, too, creative skills like photography
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.880]   and Photoshop.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:00.160]   It's for problem solvers.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:00.960]   It's for the curious.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.600]   It's for people who want to make things happen.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.920]   If you're interested in learning how to code lynda.com
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:09.480]   is a great place.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.440]   Building and distributing a simple app with Xcode and Swift.
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:15.120]   What a great way to get started with Swift.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.600]   The foundations of programming, if you're brand new to a
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:22.080]   databases communicating between classes with Objective C, up
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.640]   and running with Python and Django.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.480]   They've also had a new courses on app development.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.000]   Building and note taping, taking app for iOS 9, using
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.320]   Swift.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.560]   Two new technologies.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.080]   And look how fast they get this stuff out.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.800]   They work with the developers, with the companies, to make
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.160]   sure that when a new product comes out, they've got
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.800]   stuff day in date.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.800]   Building a calculator for Apple Watch.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:47.200]   Now that you can run apps right on Apple Watch, would you
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.520]   learn how to write something for a watch OS 2?
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.960]   They've got it.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.720]   They take you through the steps from beginning to end.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.640]   And by the end, you've written your own working app.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.720]   So awesome.
[00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.400]   I wish you know what?
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.760]   I'm just going to retire and watch lynda.com all day.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.280]   lynda.com.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.000]   You're learning from the best in the business.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.080]   Not just great teachers, but pros who work in industry.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.080]   My favorite photographers, Photoshop.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.680]   I mean, you're learning Photoshop from Vertmore.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.040]   It doesn't get better than that.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.640]   It just doesn't get better than that.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.760]   You can learn at your own pace.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.680]   There are some of us who are completionists, so that we
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.320]   like to go beginning to end.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:24.920]   Watch it.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.760]   You know, cross every T.every I.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.560]   There are those of us, myself included, short attention,
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.560]   span types.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.880]   Just want to dip in and out.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.520]   Maybe watch a chapter at a time.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.200]   Or even better, go through the transcript, search the
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.360]   transcript, and find that one little piece on how to use
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.560]   Lightroom just a little bit better.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.240]   The course transcripts are really helpful for that.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.840]   And of course, you can watch on the go.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.520]   iOS, Android, download them and watch them wherever you are,
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.000]   even on the airplane.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.440]   lynda.com, your membership gives you full access to the
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.240]   place, to all the courses, everything.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.240]   But we're going to set you up with a 10-day trial.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.240]   So you just get the experience of full access for 10 days.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.680]   Every course, every bit of material.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.040]   There is free stuff every week.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.120]   Burt Monroy's course is free for the first week, things
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:11.480]   like that.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.160]   So you can check those out as well.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.640]   But why don't you do the trial.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.840]   lynda.com/macbreak.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.480]   That'll let them know that you saw this on Macbreak weekly.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.360]   And I think you're going to really enjoy it.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.800]   lynda.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.800]   lynda.com/macbreak.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.920]   We're big fans of lynda.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.560]   I know you will be too.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.000]   Renee Ritchie is here from iMore.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:35.800]   From Washington--
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.600]   That's T1.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.640]   What is that?
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.480]   61.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.760]   61-18.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.640]   Nice.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.200]   The phone is not the limit, obviously.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.760]   The phone can do anything.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.440]   It's amazing.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.200]   Also here from Washington, DC, Alex Lindsey of the Pixel
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.000]   Core.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.560]   Nice to see you again.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.800]   It's good to be here.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.600]   Or be where I am anyway.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.880]   He likes to show us up every time.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:02.840]   Why up to something?
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.960]   There's nothing else interesting to see here.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.280]   There's a lot of hardware.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.160]   And there's a lot of fans.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.440]   It's near a server room.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.520]   So this is the only place.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.280]   Bye.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.480]   Yeah, but you can't help it.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   It's all my God.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:14.960]   It's all my God.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.120]   We're thinking the next year or so building a new studio.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.560]   So you can help us make it look that good.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.560]   We are-- we build studios.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.360]   Oh, yeah?
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.440]   We would do that.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:25.920]   Yep.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.920]   Oh.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920]   So we've all the way from the ground up.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   So wiring and--
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   We should talk.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   --design and--
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.120]   We should talk.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:33.800]   We should talk.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.800]   Andy Nacos here in his new studio
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.520]   workspace somewhere in Manhattan.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.360]   Looks good.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.600]   Little motioned.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.480]   I can finally afford a rental property right here in Midtown.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.760]   You're admitted at a time.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.560]   And also with Chris Markwart.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.440]   Great to have you.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.040]   Tips from the top floor podcast.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.000]   He does workshops at DiscoverTheTopFloor.com.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.040]   Joins me every week on the radio show.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.960]   It's always a lot of fun to have you.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.320]   Thanks for being here, Chris.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.480]   Oh, thanks for having me.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.320]   Thanks for having me.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.960]   Have anybody seen the movie yet, Steve Jobs?
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.480]   Nope.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.720]   I think I'm going to a screening on Thursday
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.320]   because, believe it or not, Aaron Sorkin's people called and said,
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.240]   would you like to talk to Aaron?
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:19.840]   Wow.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.880]   And I said, yes, I would.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.160]   And they said, well, you got to see the movie first.
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.720]   I said, OK, make me.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.400]   Good thing about it.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.120]   Although, according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.800]   people who know Steve Jobs are not thrilled over the movie.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.000]   We saw the little tussle between Sorkin
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.880]   and I don't have to ask Aaron about it and Tim Cook.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:51.400]   But Lorraine Powell Jobs, his widow, and others say it plays down
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:56.000]   Steve's accomplishments and portrays him as cruel and into me.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.320]   So I think I'm up two minds on this.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.160]   Like, do I want to see a movie about Steve Jobs' family man,
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.840]   or do I want to see a movie about Steve Jobs' technologist?
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.280]   I understand he's famous, so maybe the family man is
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.480]   in a new and interesting angle.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.560]   But we complained about this with the Ashton Kutcher movie, too.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.040]   I want to see Steve Jobs going through the next transition
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.200]   as a technologist.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.560]   I understand he had family problems,
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.280]   but that's not how he achieved his fame or his notoriety.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.000]   And I wish there really would be that Steve Jobs movie that
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.360]   covered all the stuff that we, as people who've
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.440]   been following Apple and next and all these technologies
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.920]   for years, really want to see.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.800]   So you're saying--
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.000]   And I don't know anything about the movie.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.080]   The movie covers his personal life?
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:31.720]   Well, yeah.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.920]   I've only seen the trailers and ads, but all the trailers and ads
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.560]   are mostly about his relationship with his first daughter.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.280]   And that, again, is part of him, but it's not.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.440]   That's just an isolated part of it.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.280]   I've been seeing interviews with people
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.480]   who are involved in the movie.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.480]   And they underscore that they're not
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.160]   trying to do a biopic per se so much as try
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.000]   to tell a semi-fictional story that is nonetheless true
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.720]   to this real person.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.800]   And that's why they chose instead of walking you
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.120]   through the events of his life, walking you through.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:09.880]   Here's a composite scene of how the Mac release went
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.600]   behind the scenes.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.080]   And here's a composite scene based on how
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.960]   we think this other event went.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.200]   So although people are going to very correctly identify people
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.840]   that were not present in certain meetings or things
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.760]   that were not true of certain product launches,
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.640]   their response is always going to be--
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.440]   this is a little bit like on a day
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.920]   as they're saying that we believe
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.520]   that the basic truth is there, even though for efficiency's sake,
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.480]   we decided to say that something that happened two weeks
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.840]   before happened at this point.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.840]   So there's a lot of people that are being represented
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.560]   as being involved, for instance, in the development
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.680]   of the Macintosh, because they felt as though they had
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.800]   to streamline this down to these not-taught people.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   Wow.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.480]   It's a two-hour movie covering what a 30-year span.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.320]   I mean--
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:49.800]   Well, I think--
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.360]   I think that--
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.360]   But again, if anybody tries to come away from this movie
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.640]   or any biopic--
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.360]   again, any major motion picture that's not a documentary,
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.800]   if they come out of this thinking
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.760]   that they've learned about the life of a certain person,
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.880]   they need to be re-educated on that.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.960]   I mean, even Gandhi, three hours and a lot of people think--
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.600]   it's a wonderful movie, but it did nothing
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.880]   to really explain the fullness of this person.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:16.240]   So--
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.160]   Or I think that there's a difference--
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:17.200]   --to take the difference--
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.880]   --what it is that it is an entertainment.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.200]   I mean, I think that the issue is with all of these
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.720]   is what direction you're going to take these as well.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.560]   I mean, so I think that I do think
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.200]   that they probably took a pretty negative direction.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.760]   And you could do the same thing with Gandhi.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.280]   And you could do the same thing with William Wallace,
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.440]   where those are very inspiring movies.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.200]   When you find out more about them,
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.760]   there are a complex character.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.800]   And everyone's complex.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.240]   And when you build a bio--
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:44.400]   you make a decision about which direction you want to show it.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.720]   And I think Sorkin decided to show the negative end of things.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.880]   And I think that it is a--
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.360]   because for him, that's more his style.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.120]   But I think that it's opportunistic to release it
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.600]   on an anniversary of someone's death.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.400]   That is basically what I think is probably
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.160]   going to end up being a semi-hatchet job.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.520]   And I think I'm not going to see the movie.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.480]   I mean, I'll see it when it comes out on Netflix.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.240]   It will never be on iTunes, of course.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.560]   But I think it's pissing on Steve Jobs' grave--
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.060]   Wow.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.080]   --to go see it.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:13.960]   Well, you're not alone.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:18.320]   His widow lobbied repeatedly to kill the film,
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.600]   according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.160]   including its original owner, Sony Pictures Entertainment,
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.400]   and the current distributor, Universal Pictures.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.320]   Bill Campbell was--
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.040]   Bill Campbell was an original board member,
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.360]   says, "The whole generation is going
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.240]   to think of him in a different way
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.880]   if they see a movie that depicts him in a negative way."
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.680]   Well, and I think that the rumor is,
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.240]   is the Christian Bale left for reasons that were not just
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.560]   that it didn't work for him.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.600]   He was that he wasn't interested in the direction
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.520]   the script was gone.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.020]   And so--
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.900]   That was what I was complaining about.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:50.820]   I don't want--
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.460]   Steve Jobs as a family man might be interesting,
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.660]   but I still haven't got the Steve Jobs movie I want to see.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.180]   Well, this may not be it.
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:59.420]   It's based apparently on the Isaacson book.
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:02.860]   And Ms. Jobs said she disliked the book.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:04.620]   Any movie based on the book couldn't be accurate.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:07.660]   And so Scott Rudin says, when he tried the producer of the movie,
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:10.860]   when he tried to get her to participate in the making
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.420]   of the movie and to get her input,
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.900]   she refused to discuss anything in her inscript
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.900]   that bothered her despite my repeated entreaties.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:20.900]   So--
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:24.060]   And I really think that we look at how we send messages
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.580]   to Hollywood about how we want this to look and so and so forth.
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:30.380]   And I just remind our listeners that it's the first three weeks
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:33.140]   that are critical to a movie's success.
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:39.060]   So if you decide to just drag your feet in going,
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.300]   not going to the opening weekend,
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.660]   not going for the first three weeks,
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:45.260]   by then we're into the holiday season.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.420]   They're kind of picking a gap here, obviously.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:48.020]   And why?
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.020]   Because who was also there?
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.500]   And also, we should point out, paid $200,000
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.060]   to consult on the film according to a stolen copy
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.580]   of the budget that was posted online.
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.140]   We don't know how accurate that is.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.220]   Said, it's about jobs and its personality.
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.820]   I feel it did a great job.
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:06.100]   I mean, here's a guy who knows.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.820]   I just think people should take three weeks off.
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:08.780]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.260]   You don't have to never see it.
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.300]   But if you take three weeks off, it sends--
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.020]   it's not the kind of.
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.140]   I mean, again, I think the biggest thing I have
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:20.220]   is that it's probably a negative direction for Steve Jobs.
[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.620]   And they released it near his death.
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:23.540]   I mean, I just think that's just bad taste.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:23.900]   Well--
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.660]   You know, so--
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.220]   I don't know.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:29.220]   I mean, but it's a natural sort of slot
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.460]   to release a movie like that.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.300]   And it's not big enough to release--
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:35.420]   you got to release it close enough for Oscar consideration.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.300]   But it's not big enough to really get attention
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.060]   when the Tom Hanks movie is coming up.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.020]   Tom Hanks movie is actually coming up close by to that release
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:42.940]   date anyway.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.020]   And I just have to--
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:44.620]   Well, I'm saying--
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:45.060]   --find myself a week.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.540]   --right in myself for--
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:48.460]   Right.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:48.900]   Well, I mean--
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.380]   And the Martian came out last week.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.700]   There's a lot of competition.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.780]   Yeah, I mean, the geek crowd.
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.140]   I have to keep reminding myself I'm not
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.860]   going to base a judgment on what this movie is like based
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.640]   on the trailers, which are obviously
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.340]   going to be the sort of stuff that gets people
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.580]   into theaters for those first two or three weeks.
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.260]   And it's not going to affect me positively or negatively
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:11.940]   that this is somebody whose legacy shaped myself
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:13.540]   in a lot of different geeks out there.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.940]   It could be a good movie.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.700]   It could be a bad movie.
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:19.780]   And in any way, shape or form, there's
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:22.780]   still enough people alive today who can tell the true stories
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:26.620]   and tell them in the form that they're most critical for.
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:30.820]   And Ben's mentioning that a lot of these historical figures--
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:35.220]   John Adams-- John Quincy Adams Mozart--
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.420]   the reason why we know so much about them
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.780]   is because the people that they left behind
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:42.820]   took it upon their mission for the 20 or 30 years
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.940]   after their death to make sure that their stories were
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.700]   set down in paper so that the myth would not get bigger
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.300]   than the actual accomplishments of the person.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.260]   John Adams' children, again, made sure
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.860]   that his papers were preserved, make sure that his voice was
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.860]   still being represented, and make sure that his legacy was
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:58.780]   going to be assured.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.300]   So I think that I'm not telling anybody what to do.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.940]   But what I would personally hope is
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:06.860]   that anybody who wants to make sure that the Steve Jobs that they
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.460]   knew is represented by history, I'm
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:13.420]   hoping that they will take the time to get those words down
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:14.540]   and get those stories down.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.340]   Even if what you do is you simply say,
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:19.860]   spend a couple of weeks dictating into a microphone,
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:22.380]   and then stipulating your will that these do not appear
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.380]   anywhere until 10 years after your death,
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.620]   you have a perspective that nobody else has.
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:29.060]   And if you want to make sure that this person is reflected
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.380]   well for history or accurately for history,
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.220]   that's within your power to at least play a role in that.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.620]   And we should point out that people who seem to be most
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.060]   upset about this movie have not seen it,
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:44.300]   including Ms. Jobs, Bill Campbell, Tim Cook.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.380]   They refuse to see it.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:50.380]   So we don't know what really is in the movie.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:54.140]   I'm going to go see it on Thursday, and I'll report back.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.740]   I mean, we're in an unusual position.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.820]   I mean, as Harry McCracken pointed out,
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.980]   this is one of the first major Hollywood motion pictures
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.540]   where I know almost all of the--
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:05.100]   I've actually know and have interacted with all the players.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:09.540]   I remember '94 spending 4th of July weekend with Steve,
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:14.100]   Lorraine, and by the way, his estranged daughter,
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.780]   who was at that point no longer estranged.
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:19.300]   She was, I think, 20 or 21, maybe even younger,
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:26.140]   and was very much a part of it and very much loved.
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.300]   So we'll see.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.140]   We'll really see.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.140]   I don't know.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.220]   He's in a bigger puzzle.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:33.980]   I mean, if that's the only Steve Jobs movie
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.100]   that you're ever going to watch, then that
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.100]   might be problematic.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.380]   But there's more stuff out there.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.140]   There's the Kutcher flick.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:41.660]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.660]   Well, that's not so good.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.260]   But the same thing's happening to Walt Disney right now.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:49.340]   There are a whole-- here's a very similar guy.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:51.020]   In fact, a lot of people are saying
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.060]   who's a guy very much likes Steve Jobs,
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.700]   and that he was a perfectionist.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.940]   He was demanding of his team.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:59.980]   He asked a lot and got a lot.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.940]   And I think we're mature enough to understand
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:07.460]   that a human being is a complex beast.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:10.540]   And everybody has a little demon in them
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.660]   and a little angel in them.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:15.220]   And that's not necessarily--
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:18.820]   movies not necessarily going to reflect accurately.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.620]   It's just a slice, right?
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.340]   It's just not my slice yet, Leo.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.100]   I still want it.
[01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:24.300]   Make me that movie.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:24.780]   Somebody--
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.740]   Pirates of the Silicon Valley, right?
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:27.240]   That was--
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:27.240]   Good.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.140]   But I want the second part.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.740]   I want the iPhone part of that movie.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.340]   Well, somebody will make that, don't you say I help?
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:37.100]   Noah Wiley is not that old yet.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.500]   Somebody will make that.
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.900]   Aaron Sorkin's never loved technology very much.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.260]   I think part of the reason people were worried
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.620]   is the social network.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:48.940]   Really portrayed Mark Zuckerberg as a buffoon,
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.020]   semi-autistic buffoon.
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:55.900]   And Sorkin has historically been negative of bloggers
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.460]   and others.
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.900]   So we'll see.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.260]   We'll see.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:02.940]   It's based on-- what do they say?
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:04.260]   Based on the life of a--
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.620]   The based on the life rights and that legally covers you.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.620]   But one day Aaron Sorkin will make a behind the scenes
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:10.780]   at Twitter, behind the scenes at some blog company.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.900]   And then we can get upset.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.340]   It'll be a love letter to all the hard work.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.380]   Well, we just have the real question
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:20.020]   to watch is how many Sorkinisms are actually in the film.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:20.520]   You know?
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.580]   Have you seen the Sorkinisms?
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.020]   Yes.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:22.420]   Have you seen--
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:23.500]   Yes.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.860]   That's the-- we should see how many.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:25.380]   No doubt.
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.540]   Aaron has also seen them and is going to endeavor
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.820]   to not use them ever again.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:30.820]   One would hope.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.500]   Oh, we would hope.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.900]   And I don't know if we've got the interview with him or not.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:38.220]   But I certainly hope to.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.060]   And I will ask him those questions.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.700]   We'll ask the challenging questions.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.860]   We'll see what happens.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.860]   iOS 9.0.2.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.420]   Alex, I credit you every day with a statement
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.980]   that don't download the new OS.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:56.780]   Don't download the fix to the new OS.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:59.940]   Wait and download the fix to the fix.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:00.780]   Here it is.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:01.380]   Here it is.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.340]   Is it safe?
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.180]   So far, so good.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.860]   I won't use dental tools when I ask you that.
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:08.900]   Is it safe?
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:10.500]   Yeah, I downloaded it.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.460]   It seems to be working well.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.740]   It's definitely working better than the last version.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:18.180]   So there was a lot of sticky issues and things that it wasn't--
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.780]   I had that bug that they were talking about with iMessages
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:24.020]   where it suddenly wasn't authenticating correctly.
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.300]   So I think that a lot of that stuff definitely
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.580]   seems to be cleared up.
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.820]   What is your sense--
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.860]   Renee, I'm sure you're on the front lines of all this.
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.260]   What are people saying?
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.020]   No, I mean, Alex gives great advice.
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.740]   If you don't want the first version,
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:39.660]   don't get the red update, which is the one right after it.
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.980]   Get the blue update, which is the one
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.180]   that has a little more time behind it.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.140]   Right.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:46.780]   And 9.1 beta 4 just came out today.
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:48.460]   So we're--
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.580]   No rest for the weary.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.580]   We're heading full speed ahead to 9.1.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:54.380]   Yeah, we should be around iPad Pro Time.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:58.940]   I'm waiting for that because of the new Burrito emoji.
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:02.180]   See, I'm desperately-- if anyone from the Unicode or Apple
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.500]   is listening, just take the French Fry emoji.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.460]   And when I long press on that, give me options for tater tots,
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:08.540]   poutine, and chips.
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:09.460]   That's all I need.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.420]   The Canadian along the rest.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:12.980]   What you should be able to do is just
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.660]   like you can actually do skin color on human abilities,
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:19.420]   you can just basically have like topping emojis that are followed
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.260]   by that actually puts on chili or cheese curries.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.780]   Fully loaded baked.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:27.260]   Or 50 different degrees of crunchiness, you know?
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:27.780]   Yes.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:28.700]   Darker fries.
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:29.820]   And brighter fries.
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.660]   I like it.
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.180]   Sounds awesome.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.260]   Filing a radar right now.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.300]   I'm getting hungry.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:37.980]   Can it be?
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:40.940]   Apple is so happy with its new spaceship campus
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:44.260]   that they've decided to build a second one.
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:46.420]   In Sunnyvale.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.260]   I think they're leasing it.
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:48.740]   So we were joking that they would soon
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.500]   have to put platforms out in the bay
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.740]   and just helicopter people in because they're already
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:55.260]   far beyond the capacity of campus, too.
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:56.060]   It's amazing.
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:57.620]   And the campus too is big.
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:58.700]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:02.420]   This is a three-- this is the campus from Land Bank
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:07.740]   Investments, the architectural firm HOK.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:10.180]   Another kind of round of design, although this was
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.300]   this beautiful design.
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:11.740]   Look at this.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.340]   I'm not sophisticated enough to understand
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.380]   why they're leasing versus buying.
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.380]   But I'm sure--
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:18.700]   The company's building it for them.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:19.620]   Right.
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.660]   It might just be until they can build their own campus three.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:24.460]   Wow.
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:25.740]   That is amazing.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:28.220]   I guess the company figures, hey, you can always--
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:29.940]   at least it's somebody the next people saying, hey,
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:31.580]   it's a former Apple campus.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.740]   Look how swoopy-dupy it is.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.100]   It might have left a vault behind.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.420]   It might have left some money.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:39.340]   On the left, what it looks like today,
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.180]   Ick on the right.
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.380]   Ooh, pretty.
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.740]   So there you go.
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:51.540]   New swoopy-dupy campus, a clover leaf.
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.460]   Now there'll be a battle among Apple employees, which
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.180]   campus are you on?
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:56.260]   Do they have a choice?
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:57.380]   No, probably not.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:58.740]   Depends on projects.
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.420]   Is there a possibility that they're
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:02.660]   trying to, like, with the shapes of these buildings,
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.900]   write a message that could be seen from space?
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.140]   Should we at least consider that as a possibility?
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:10.220]   I thought they had secret Mario Kart tracks at the bottom.
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.780]   And the first one was this loop, and this one
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:12.940]   is the high-pitched turns.
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:15.060]   The clover kind of looks like the Fan Key.
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:18.340]   It's almost-- they came so close.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:21.340]   They just missing the fourth thing to make it the Fan Key.
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:22.940]   So they're doing a command open?
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.420]   Workout or a car.
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:25.940]   It's a nice-shaped command.
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:26.940]   Oh, wow.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:30.180]   It's a new shape of the home screen icons.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:33.100]   Apple has purchased two, not one,
[01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:35.900]   but two new artificial intelligence companies
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:38.340]   over the last couple of days.
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.700]   Siri gon' get smarter.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.980]   Bloomberg reports they bought Perceptio,
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:48.860]   a company that makes image recognition technology,
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:53.860]   or as I call it, "recognology" for smartphones.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.580]   Deep learning for smartphones.
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.220]   This way, you know, these are all--
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.860]   But it's on board, so it's not cloud-based.
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.620]   So it fizzed without the strategy of doing things
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.020]   device-side.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.100]   And then on Friday, they got Vocal IQ,
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:07.260]   which is a UK-based startup developing technology,
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.860]   to help computers understand human speech.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.100]   You can have longer conversations with Siri.
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.900]   Well, I think they have to apply that to the German Siri,
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.900]   because I use my iPhone in English,
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:21.900]   even though I'm German, because the German Siri is just
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.740]   by far not as smart as the English.
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:24.580]   Really?
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.140]   Doesn't have the Wolfram Alpha integration, for example.
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:33.300]   So I can't even ask simple questions that are an easy look up,
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.820]   because it doesn't have the proper data sources.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:36.660]   That's disappointing.
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:38.100]   How's the Canadian Siri?
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.340]   Is she all right?
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:41.940]   Yeah, she's roughly analogous to the US.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.140]   We can't buy movie tickets, because there's no movie tickets
[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.500]   to talk comm service, but that is one of the few admissions.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:52.940]   They're good purchases.
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:55.020]   So you use it in English?
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.660]   Do a lot of Germans do that?
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.300]   No, no, no, no.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:19:59.700]   They just don't think of Siri as it is.
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:00.860]   They just miss out.
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:04.620]   They use it for reminders, and the odds, I don't know,
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:05.100]   quick thing.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:09.700]   But the really deep stuff, or the deep-ish stuff,
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.780]   I still find English works much better.
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:12.620]   I mean, simple thing.
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:16.740]   I tried, for the longest time, to find a good way in German
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.500]   to tell Siri to put something on my shopping list.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.180]   What you can do?
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:22.180]   Oh, we can do it easily.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.020]   Oh, we can do it easily.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:24.100]   Add milk to my shopping list, fam.
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:24.860]   It's on there.
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:27.580]   In German, it does just not really work.
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.260]   I filed bugs for it.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:30.500]   It's not this--
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.980]   That was disappointing.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:33.060]   I can say, hey, Siri.
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.860]   Remind me to buy milk the next time I'm
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:36.340]   at a luma market.
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:39.140]   And it will then ping me when I get to petaluma market.
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:39.340]   Yes, yes.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.380]   It's GFS.
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:41.900]   And say, don't forget to buy milk.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:42.540]   That's useful.
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.980]   If there's a way to do it in German,
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.060]   I haven't found it yet.
[01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:46.860]   That's disappointing.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:50.940]   Let's see.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.500]   Apple, we warned them.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.820]   We warned them.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.820]   Don't do a tear down of your developer version of the Apple
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.140]   TV.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.460]   We warned them.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.980]   Headlines were horrible, because the headlines all
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:03.820]   said that Apple banned the app, which is not true.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.340]   Apple just canceled the developer account,
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:08.300]   and they happen to have apps associated to that account.
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:08.860]   I fix it.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:09.860]   Yeah, we do that.
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:10.860]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.580]   It was even worse, because there's
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.820]   some headlines that are saying that Apple was pulling down
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.340]   apps that teach you how to repair your own devices.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:24.620]   But as Renee said, they violated developer agreement.
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.580]   That means they pull your apps, and your apps
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.540]   happen to have this functionality.
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.940]   So it's not as though Apple was doing anything
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:34.060]   spiteful or wrong that was a bug.
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:34.780]   I fix it new.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:38.140]   They said, quote, in their blog, we weighed the risks,
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:41.540]   blindly tossed those risks over our shoulders,
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:43.300]   and tore down the Apple TV anyway.
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.900]   They knew this would happen.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.060]   It's good press.
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:48.060]   It's what you do.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:48.740]   The blog was called the Apple Store.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.300]   Well, but they lost their Apple Store, right?
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.740]   Well, they lost their developer account,
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.820]   and then the app was tied to the developer account.
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.940]   Is that what it is, Renee?
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:57.300]   Yeah, and they said, well, we haven't
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.860]   updated it in years anyway, and her website
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:00.860]   is better, so no big deal.
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:02.500]   No big deal.
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.820]   But again, it's the headline.
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:06.940]   That and the headlines for the virus this week
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:09.300]   were just beyond annoying.
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.540]   Let's talk about the virus, actually, as well.
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:13.580]   He's Spectre.
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:15.940]   So you Spectre is something that nobody listening to the show
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:16.620]   has to worry about.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.780]   If you are in China and you decide
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:21.260]   you need to download a video player from the web,
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.140]   and then you ignore the warnings,
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:26.940]   and you go all the-- in iOS 9, it says you can't launch this app.
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:27.820]   It's not trusted.
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:30.340]   You go all the way to Settings, you tell it to override that
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.660]   and to trust this developer, and then you launch it,
[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:34.620]   you might get some spyware on your device.
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:37.660]   But the only headlines we saw is iOS devices, malware,
[01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.500]   no jailbreak required.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:40.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.260]   So in effect, you did have to jailbreak
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:46.260]   because you'd have to be able to download it, sideload it.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.940]   Well, no, you can download-- basically, it
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:50.420]   uses the same enterprise certificate
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:52.260]   that you can use if you're in an enterprise
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.220]   to distribute things.
[01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.700]   But in iOS 9, Apple's made it significantly harder.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:56.740]   There's no button to do it.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:59.700]   You have to, on your own, go to Settings, go to General,
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.140]   go to Profile, go to a list of developers,
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.300]   pick the developer, and then say trust this developer
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:06.060]   in order to be able to launch it.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.420]   And that's just basically overriding
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.380]   all the protections that are built in.
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:11.620]   So in my opinion, these articles are the virus.
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.620]   This is the thing that gets-- my mom again, she called me
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.020]   because she just read it, I think,
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:16.340]   of the Wall Street Journal or something.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.420]   And so, oh my god, there's viruses on there.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.700]   There's usually much more damage than the actual attack,
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:22.940]   which, again, only affects people in China
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:26.340]   who fall for the scam of downloading the app
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:29.140]   and then following the crazy instructions to install it.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:33.060]   - It just reminded me, somebody tweeted,
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:36.540]   "I'm going to shout, I love you
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:40.100]   because the world is a warm and loving place,
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:41.860]   but I'm gonna shout it in German
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.620]   because it's also baffling and confusing."
[01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.020]   (laughing)
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:46.860]   And I'm saying.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.860]   (laughing)
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.260]   - Mm.
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.740]   - I wish I could find that tweet.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.180]   (laughing)
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:53.420]   - No insult intended.
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.620]   - I'll be that baffling and confusing.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.460]   - No, just if you shout something in German,
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.900]   it just scares people.
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.460]   - But it also gets much longer, so you need more time.
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:02.380]   - It gets longer, yeah.
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.540]   - Yeah.
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.380]   (laughing)
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.380]   - Sorry, I shouldn't have brought that up.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:10.340]   So, why Spectre, don't do that.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:13.980]   Don't, of course, doi, don't install software
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:15.620]   for strangers. - If there's a big cliff,
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:17.460]   don't step over the fence.
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:19.100]   - Doi. - And then walk up to the edge
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:20.500]   and then start skipping along the edge.
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:21.900]   I mean, that's kind of--
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:23.460]   - And they don't, if you're a publisher,
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.740]   please don't publish anything saying massive,
[01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:28.260]   massive accident zone in Los Angeles.
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:30.060]   - Please.
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:31.860]   - Take your keyboards away at that point.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:34.780]   - You also, after, before you did the iOS 9 review,
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.300]   wrote along El Capitan. - Yes.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.380]   - Review.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.420]   I'm really liking El Capitan.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:44.900]   It does break some things, probably things that used
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:47.700]   deprecated or not approved Apple hooks,
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:51.460]   things like menu meters, stuff that changes the menu.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:52.820]   - Well, the things that it breaks mostly
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:55.380]   is stuff that, yeah, so things, and Mark, I think,
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.820]   if he hasn't already, he's rapidly fixing the eyesight stuff,
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:00.860]   but what it does is system integrity protection,
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.900]   which is the marketing name for rootless.
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.380]   And it's one of those things that Apple,
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:07.060]   any modern company has to deal with defensive depth.
[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:08.580]   It's not enough to just say,
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.460]   we have a protected operating system anymore
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.740]   because there's so many things,
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.620]   including social engineering that can trip you up.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:16.460]   And what system integrity protection does
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:18.060]   is if everything else fails,
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.860]   if you knowingly download something
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:22.740]   and the malware definitions try to stop it,
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:26.340]   if you turn off gatekeepers so that you're installing it anyway,
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:27.900]   what this tries to do is if you manage
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.940]   to get a root privilege escalation,
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.820]   it stops the damage that an app with root privilege can do.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:35.500]   So it can't write to a bunch of secure system files.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.100]   And it really does everything it's can to make sure
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.700]   that whatever infection you do get is contained.
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:41.620]   But that also means that software that was doing it,
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:44.740]   software that would do things like Kext and kernel injections,
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.180]   they can't work the same way that they used to.
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:49.500]   And some people need them desperately can reboot
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.980]   into recovery mode and turn off system integrity protection
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.740]   and then do that. - Oh, don't do that.
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:54.980]   - But yeah, but don't ever do that.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.420]   - Oh, too bad.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.380]   - Most people just find another way of doing it
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:25:59.700]   or wait for the software to update.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.180]   - Yeah, my iClock Pro, which I guess is doing that
[01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:04.140]   with K extensions or something.
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:07.980]   I really like it, but it's, I noticed it stopped working.
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:09.700]   They say they're working on a,
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:12.460]   it's actually was a pick on Mac break weekly Andy
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.860]   of yours, they're working on an El Capitan version.
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:16.940]   So it's possible to do all of these things.
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:19.340]   You just have to do them in an Apple fashion.
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.420]   - It's like sandboxing, they have to work their way around them.
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:23.620]   - And it's, it is a power user computer.
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:24.900]   And some people say they don't want anything done
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:25.740]   with their computer.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.660]   And for those people again, you can turn it off.
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:29.340]   But for the vast majority of people,
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:30.700]   the threat of infection is much,
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.500]   is much greater than the threat of kernel.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.020]   - Absolutely.
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.860]   - No, and I presume that Apple said a signal long ago,
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.100]   don't do this because we're gonna break you soon.
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:43.660]   This is not a surprise.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.820]   Oh, it's Jerry. - There's.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:49.420]   - It's Jerry Ryan who tweeted that, eight of nine or.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:51.740]   Tell someone you love them today because life is short,
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.620]   but shout it at them in German because life is also
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:55.940]   terrifying, confusing.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:57.300]   - Terrifying, confusing.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.900]   (laughing)
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:00.820]   - I like Germans.
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.540]   - I'm, that's, I'm, do you figure it now?
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:07.060]   Yeah, I'm just, can I tell you that
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:09.180]   when we were in Germany on the Riverboat cruise,
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:13.260]   I had, I wasn't expecting anything.
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:16.140]   I was, it had never been one of my favorite countries.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.820]   I like the romantic Spanish Italian French countries.
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:20.780]   I had a blast.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:21.620]   The food was great.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.260]   The people were wonderful.
[01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:28.260]   And it's, it's, it really on the forefront of being eco-friendly,
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:35.180]   of being, you know, brilliant designers and engineers.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.820]   I mean, it is, it's an amazing country.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:38.620]   - How many castles did you have to visit?
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.620]   - Saw a lot of castles.
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.900]   (laughing)
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:44.420]   - Okay, but that's 'cause I was going down the rhyme.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:45.340]   What else are you gonna see?
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.220]   - And there's a hundred mile canal joining the run
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.060]   in the monomaint.
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.220]   It's like amazing engineering feat that nobody
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.700]   in the rest of the world knows about,
[01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:55.020]   but, but obviously I'm sure in Germany is a big story.
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.740]   It was really a wonderful trip and I had a great time
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:58.820]   and I would go back to it.
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:27:59.940]   - Not terrifying.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:02.300]   - Not in the least terrifying work, confusing.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.620]   - I wanted to hear that from you.
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:05.340]   - Although you seeing me in later,
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.900]   Jose might be a little terrifying.
[01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:08.340]   - Is there a picture of me now?
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.180]   - Oh yeah.
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.020]   - Oh yeah, really.
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:11.740]   - Oh, I bought the, I got the whole Bavarian kit.
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:12.580]   - Oh you did.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.420]   - Oh my God, yes.
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:14.820]   - Oh, I haven't, I'm sure.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.340]   - I must, somebody will show it to you.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.940]   - Is there a live photo Leo?
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.980]   - Either I missed that or I've seen it
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.460]   and decided to blank it out, you know.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:23.700]   - I should have worn it today.
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.420]   You know, you would have been felt much more at home.
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:27.380]   - And then I got the, it's reindeer leather.
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.980]   I got the reindeer leather shoes.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:30.060]   - And then you would have expected me
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.220]   to start a Yodel, right?
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.260]   - Yeah, and I have the little hat with the feather,
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:36.100]   the whole thing.
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.020]   - Uh huh.
[01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.980]   - And I have to say, 'cause when I was there,
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.060]   they said, oh no, no, no, you have to have this.
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.500]   You can't go to Oktoberfest.
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.220]   You're missing Oktoberfest, my friend.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.420]   - I've never been to Oktoberfest.
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:47.420]   - Oh, okay, well, you're not missing a thing.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:49.300]   You can't go to Oktoberfest without wearing
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.900]   your Bavarian outfit.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.260]   And say everybody say, oh, you have to get
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:54.180]   with his Bavarian outfit.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:55.940]   So I went and I got the Bavarian outfit
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:57.740]   and then I see all the Germans snickering
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:58.660]   as I walk out the door.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.340]   I feel like I've been maybe conned.
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:01.180]   - They got you.
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:02.020]   - They got me.
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.340]   - I got another one.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:04.260]   Ah, ah!
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.340]   - I think the tour is outnumber the Germans
[01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.700]   on Oktoberfest quite a bit.
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:10.620]   - I want to go to Oktoberfest.
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:11.620]   It looks like a lot of fun.
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:12.500]   - Oh, it is a lot of fun.
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.780]   It's also a lot of alcohol.
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:16.580]   There you go, there I am in the...
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:17.820]   - Oh my God.
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.900]   (laughing)
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:23.460]   If only you could see the shoes and the knees.
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:25.460]   - For a Megan, this really doesn't look too happy
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.180]   about the most on the new screen savers that day.
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:31.060]   Oktoberfest just ended.
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.220]   - No, this is terrifying.
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:34.060]   - What?
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:34.900]   - This.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:35.740]   - That?
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.580]   - Yeah, I'm confusing.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:37.420]   - I'm confusing.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.460]   - It's both.
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:41.220]   I'll set a picture to Jerry Ryan, let her know.
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:44.020]   - What do they say in Germany about the Audi
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:45.740]   and the Volkswagen scandal?
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.580]   - Ooh, big thing.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.980]   I mean, it's in the news all the time now.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:50.780]   It...
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:56.020]   Some Germans think it has a pretty good chance
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:00.140]   to ruin Germany's technology reputation.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:01.820]   - Well, here's the latest good news.
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:05.500]   Apparently Ford, Mazda, BMW and Mercedes
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.820]   all did the same thing.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.220]   - Everyone is.
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.060]   I would expect everyone to have...
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:13.100]   I mean, and then obviously they're trying to push it
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:16.140]   on the engineers because they were the ones who put it.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:16.980]   - Well, no.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:19.780]   - It's certainly not a good thing.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:22.140]   I mean, how can you do something like that?
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:24.620]   Even though it was kind of a known thing,
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:26.100]   apparently, for a long time.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:29.220]   People kind of knew that that was happening.
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:33.060]   It was just hard to really find out about it
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:39.060]   or to be able to prove it because none of the officials
[01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.260]   had any access to the actual software, to the code.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:45.860]   - Here's the take.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:47.700]   It turns out the Volkswagen engines are polluting
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:54.180]   31st, 5% less than Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Mazda, BMW.
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:57.660]   This was a test that done at Leeds University.
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:59.580]   And the worst is Ford.
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:03.140]   6.8 times over the Nitrogen oxide.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:05.540]   - It was just for diesel, right?
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:06.540]   - These are all these.
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:08.860]   - Yeah, there will be certainly someone at VW
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:10.460]   who's very happy about that now.
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:15.260]   But I mean, these limits, I think,
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:18.660]   it was what I heard was just impossible to get these limits.
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:19.660]   - They couldn't do it.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.460]   They made the engine and it turned out, it's not even close.
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:23.660]   So they said, what can we do?
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:25.260]   - Yes.
[01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:26.660]   - Hey, we could cheat.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:29.860]   - And now they're calling them back and fixing something.
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.660]   I think it's not mandatory though.
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:34.340]   So a lot of people are probably afraid that their cars
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:35.260]   are going to turn into--
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.460]   - Sluggards.
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:37.860]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:39.060]   - So I'm not sure.
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:39.860]   - Yeah, there's no--
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.460]   - I have to limit it up.
[01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:43.460]   - There'd be no way that I take my car back.
[01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.860]   - I just like, I'd be like, hey, it runs fine right now.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:48.260]   - Yeah, I'm sure it's uploading 40 times more than the other--
[01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:49.260]   - Software update and then--
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.260]   - Federal level.
[01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:52.660]   - You have all 10 people that have diesel cars.
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:54.260]   - Yeah, that's--
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.860]   - You know, I mean, the future is--
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.260]   I mean, some of this stuff is absurd.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.460]   I mean, I have to know that I just went through this big thing,
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:04.460]   trying to get my computer to sync up with the EBD or OBD
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:05.060]   or whatever.
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.060]   - EBD is too important.
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:10.860]   - It should be idiotic California regulation of trying--
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.260]   it's been two weeks trying to get my computer to assign it.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:15.660]   But the smog is fine, like what's coming out the back is fine.
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:16.860]   It's just that it can't get--
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.060]   it hasn't turned-- it hasn't communicated with the catalytic
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:20.460]   converter and all this stuff.
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:22.460]   I mean, I have to admit that the big issue is,
[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:24.660]   is that all the states have gone crazy.
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:26.460]   And so I get it, but it's just--
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.460]   - Well, these are also European standards.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.460]   It's not just the US.
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.060]   - OK, they've all gone crazy.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.060]   - Yeah.
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.060]   - Well, you know, move to electric and--
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:35.460]   - You know what, I love them in Germany
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:38.860]   and they're-- of course, we're seeing a lot of nuclear plants.
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:42.380]   But there is-- we're also seeing a huge number of windmills.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:46.780]   There's a massive attempt to move to renewables, solar, and wind.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.060]   - Germany is getting better.
[01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:49.340]   - Yeah.
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:51.580]   - There's still-- I mean, there's still base load
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:52.860]   that you can't do with renewables,
[01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:54.620]   because they are not as steady.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.300]   Like, the wind doesn't blow all the time.
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:01.660]   So some of that-- actually, still comes from nuclear plants
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:02.460]   that might not--
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:03.300]   - But they're closing them down.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.460]   - That might not be in the country.
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:05.460]   They might be buying--
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.460]   - Ah.
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:07.620]   - So-- yeah.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:09.940]   But the goal, I think, is still a stated goal
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:16.780]   to have no nuclear plants, I think, in 2020-- 2020.
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:19.500]   - We-- on the cruise ship, we couldn't have bottled water.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.060]   We had to put it in a metal--
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:23.620]   I mean, there really was a real attention
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:26.020]   to kind of paying essentially the environment.
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:27.700]   I wish we were paying this much attention in the States.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.340]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:31.420]   - And I do think-- I think that electric is important.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:34.140]   I mean, I've already decided that the car that I have right now
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:35.460]   is the last gas.
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:36.740]   - Oh, we totally--
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:40.260]   - Don't tell Lisa, but I put a reservation on the X,
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:41.260]   the Tesla X.
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:42.260]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:45.860]   We just bought a battery powered lawnmower.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:46.860]   - It's quiet.
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:48.180]   - It's we call it our garden Tesla.
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:49.180]   - I hate--
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:50.180]   - Nice.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.180]   - I hate leaf blowers.
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.980]   Those things, not only are they two-stroke engines are worse
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.460]   and they're noisy, they pollute like hell.
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.380]   - Oh, and did you-- if you go to electric,
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.300]   you don't have to go to gas station by gas,
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.660]   put oil in, whatever.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:02.660]   It's not dirty.
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:03.660]   - Don't put me over the top of the Tesla.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:05.220]   We have a supercharger in Petaluma.
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:06.220]   That's free, by the way.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.380]   You pull up, it fills you up and you go on your way.
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:09.380]   Free gas.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:10.380]   - That'll be your new favorite spot.
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:11.380]   - Why wouldn't you buy it?
[01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.380]   - Free gas.
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:16.900]   - Of course, I don't know where the electricity comes from.
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:18.820]   Probably a nuclear plant in Germany.
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.060]   - But I think the more important thing is--
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:21.060]   - I want to export everything.
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:22.060]   - Because it's a pipeline.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.220]   It's a nuclear pipeline.
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:26.380]   - But by moving the-- by moving all the cars to electric,
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:28.100]   or in which it's going to be the direction,
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:31.980]   you know, it'll let you make those changes centrally
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:33.060]   and then it affects everything.
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:35.020]   So you slowly get rid of everything else.
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:37.460]   The key is getting rid of cars that you have to stop
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:39.380]   and pour liquid into, which is insane.
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:40.580]   - Well, and the other thing that's interesting,
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:42.540]   it's pretty clear, and a number of people pointed this out,
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:45.700]   that the Tesla X is intended to be
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:47.340]   an autonomous vehicle eventually.
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:49.620]   They're working very hard.
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.460]   There's a lot of it.
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.620]   It does automatic lane changing.
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.860]   When you approach the door opens.
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:56.420]   - You're in a Johnny cab.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:58.260]   The door opens for you.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.660]   - Where is Elon Musk, Leo?
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:03.100]   - Is it Elon Musk that said, you know,
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.740]   one of these manufacturers that, you know, in 2020,
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.140]   will start having self-driving cars
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:08.940]   and by 2035 or something like that,
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.660]   humans won't be allowed to drive them.
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:11.500]   - Right.
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:12.340]   - You know, like at all.
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:13.180]   - Right.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.020]   - It's just, they're too dangerous.
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:14.860]   - It's not safe, we're dangerous.
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:17.100]   Insurance companies will push that.
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:19.460]   - But until that 20, 40, we'll be allowed to live.
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:20.620]   I mean, they just last time.
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.100]   - Those humans, let's get them off the planet.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.100]   - But until that point, I think it's going to be really easy
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:28.220]   to stump the self-driving cars by just being human around them.
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:29.060]   That's what I--
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.580]   - That's, they need to all go self-driving.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:31.780]   - Yeah, because humans are the danger.
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:35.540]   - Because they will be all on the safe side all the time
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:37.500]   to not cause any accidents.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.780]   So you'll just drive like--
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.140]   - Drive like a bat on a hill and--
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:42.500]   - Like your usual self.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.380]   - All these electric cars will just stay away.
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:48.020]   - They will not just be sitting there waiting to get,
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:49.500]   to be able to move, yeah.
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.940]   - You haven't seen any demos of those in Northeast weather.
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:52.780]   I think that's for us.
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:57.060]   - No, in fact, I would never buy a Tesla where it's cold,
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:58.660]   'cause it doesn't, they don't do well in the cold
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:35:59.980]   for a lot of reasons.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:01.820]   - My boss, Kevin, has a model last right now,
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.860]   and he's waiting for the winter testing.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:04.700]   - Yeah.
[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:07.660]   - Germany Mercedes just had a first official test
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:10.580]   on the Autobahn with self-driving trucks.
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:11.420]   - Yeah.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:12.940]   - So we're getting there.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.900]   - Yeah, really self-driving trucks.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:15.740]   - Yes.
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:16.580]   - Wow.
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:19.940]   - It's a limited kind of a problem on the Autobahn,
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.620]   'cause things are quite well-defined.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:23.860]   - I just want a car with doors that go like this.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:25.340]   - Yeah, well, you'll get one.
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:29.220]   If you open them up fast enough
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:30.060]   - You can close them, you'll-
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.220]   - They're even working on a way
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.580]   when you pull up to the supercharger
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:34.300]   just plugs itself in.
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:35.660]   - That's again, it's all about a ton.
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.300]   - I've seen that video, it looks kind of eerie,
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:38.460]   the snake thing.
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:39.780]   - Yeah.
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.540]   - Just a matter of time.
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:44.020]   I will be sitting, I'll be reading a book,
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:45.220]   sitting in the backseat.
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:47.980]   I can see my obituary now.
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:49.300]   (laughing)
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:50.900]   - Good podcast while being driven somewhere,
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:53.420]   like I had a lot of reading.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.820]   - He was listening to Audible.
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:56.860]   (laughing)
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.500]   - Great, I'll talk to you from the backseat of an ex.
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.180]   Anything else to say about El Camitain?
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:02.020]   Besides, it has the best name ever.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.740]   - El Camitain.
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:05.940]   - There's still a lot, I haven't upgraded yet,
[01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:07.460]   and I think there's still a lot of warnings about,
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:08.740]   and we would generally be careful
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.820]   if you're using professional software,
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:12.300]   video software and 3D software.
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:15.620]   Typically, it's a great thing to stall a little bit.
[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:17.780]   I always say stall, but I mean, really,
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:20.380]   for professional, give the manufacturers a little time
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:21.940]   to, or the product developer,
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:22.980]   a little time to do their update.
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:25.820]   So I'd like to see my 3D in everything else updated
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:28.740]   before I moved to a new OS.
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:32.260]   - Is the upgrade Renee is the upgrade in place working nicely?
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:33.940]   Do we have to do a clean install for any reason?
[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:36.420]   - No, the upgrade in place is working really, really well.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:37.780]   - Not really well.
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:39.700]   - Yeah, and you know, after last week,
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:40.900]   when I said levelator wasn't working,
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.300]   the folks at tidbits put up an article,
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.380]   and you just copy a file over and you'll explain again.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.140]   So yeah, so there are those working on this,
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:47.940]   but to Alex's point, if you were using production stuff
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.060]   on a production machine, just wait as long as you can.
[01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:53.300]   - I, of course, didn't wait, and didn't love me.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.780]   I just leapt in, leapt forward as soon as I saw it.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:38:01.820]   I was so impatient that I couldn't even put it on a USB key,
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:03.860]   I downloaded it on everything.
[01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:04.980]   - And the new security stuff,
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:06.780]   and syncing the new Notes app itself
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.260]   was a no-brainer for me.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:10.300]   - Yeah, I mean, if you're gonna use,
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:13.060]   if you got the new iPhone, you really want El Capitan, right?
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:13.900]   - Yeah.
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:15.140]   - For a lot of reasons.
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.180]   - The live photos, and again, the nice to use Notes
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:18.900]   just to put little bits of text back and forth,
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.580]   but now I throw anything in there,
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:22.060]   and then it's automatically on my devices,
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.380]   and I can just go get it.
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:26.420]   It's like the world's best clouds on clipboard.
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:27.260]   - Yeah.
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:32.740]   - Yeah, the slogan is really important
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:35.100]   that they get the kerning right on the slogan.
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:36.260]   (laughing)
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:40.980]   I'm just saying, just really important that that C and that L
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.700]   really are clearly, that's why they made San Francisco Leo,
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:48.060]   that's the entire raison that you look at that
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:50.580]   from a distance, and it just,
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:53.300]   it says something different, completely different.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:55.100]   - Yeah, especially over here,
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:57.740]   because the internet is really good in this room,
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:59.300]   but there's a little bit of pixelation
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.860]   that really does completely look like that.
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:04.180]   - Yeah, if you squint, as a matter of fact,
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:06.020]   with every Nixon, with every car--
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.340]   - I'm taking a screenshot right now.
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:11.340]   (laughing)
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:15.700]   - Really important that you just get the spacing right.
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:18.460]   - It's not as bad as the worst time I saw that.
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:20.300]   There was the time of the Sci-Fi channel.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:24.100]   Their standard coming up next font was this really blocky
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:27.420]   sort of font, and the kerning was also two together.
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.300]   So I want you to imagine a font like that
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:32.340]   with the places of the letters of two together,
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:36.020]   and the next movie is Star Trek, the final frontier.
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:36.860]   - Okay, now, yeah.
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:38.420]   - That was a spit-take sort of moment.
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:39.940]   (laughing)
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.380]   I wondered what channel I was actually on.
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:44.740]   - This really is my motto though, I have to say.
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:46.420]   So there you go.
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:49.880]   El Capitain, upgrade, but not too quickly.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.720]   Same rule always.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:56.480]   I upgrade, and most of us have done it now,
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.640]   'cause we're typical Apple users inpatient
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.640]   for the new--
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:00.640]   - And it's free.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:01.840]   - And it's free.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:05.400]   Pixar's testing out the iPad Pro, I want that pencil.
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:06.520]   - Oh, and Disney just tweeted too,
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.080]   that they just got it today.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.000]   - Nice.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.600]   I mean, these are the people you wanna give it to,
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.600]   right, illustrators, animators.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.840]   - They're also affiliated with Apple though.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:16.840]   - Yeah, well, Pixar's practically an Apple company.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:17.680]   - Exactly.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:18.600]   - Yeah, Disney too.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.320]   So that's a perfect place to kind of promote--
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.240]   - They're not gonna say bad.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.080]   - Pencil.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:23.920]   - Yeah.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.280]   - Oh, they put up, I'll send you the link,
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.960]   they did a periscope of testing out the pencil at Disney.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.800]   - Oh, nice.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.080]   I imagine this is how animators,
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:36.800]   illustrators will be working from now.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.560]   Again, that's why the Surface Book is so interesting.
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:41.960]   It looks like that, I wish I could draw.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:45.720]   I envy you, Renee, I wish I had some artistic skill.
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:48.280]   - I don't know. - I don't know.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:49.400]   - First ever Mickey Mouse.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:50.240]   - It's not too late though, right?
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:51.640]   You can learn to draw it in EH.
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.560]   - It's not a-- - I just drew every daily.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.960]   I was terrible at it every day.
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:55.800]   - Right.
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.640]   - But less terrible. - When did you start
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.480]   doing that though?
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:58.800]   - I, when I was seven.
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:40:59.960]   - Okay, see, that's what I'm saying.
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.160]   - See, that's why we have photographers.
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:02.200]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.000]   - Yeah, but I wanna be a drawer.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.760]   I would love to be--
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.640]   - Cartier-Breson.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.760]   - Cartier-Breson started in--
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.120]   - It was like a painter.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:11.440]   - Yeah, it was a painter.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.280]   - And a photographer.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.200]   - Yeah. - And a painter.
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:18.200]   Here's the, here's the Periscope playing with the iPad
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.680]   Pro hands on.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.680]   Damn you vertical video.
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:23.520]   - Damn you-- - It's fixed that code,
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:24.760]   didn't they?
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.240]   - They fixed it and Periscope,
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:27.600]   you can shoot sideways now.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:28.440]   - Do this again.
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.040]   - Model here so you can be like that.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:31.040]   - Let's do a new one.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:34.000]   - So when does Procreate?
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:34.840]   - Oh, there we are.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.280]   - This is Disney, right?
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.120]   - Yeah.
[01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:38.280]   - I think that's the Procreate app.
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.000]   - It's horizontal with the pencils.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.160]   - And we're testing out and showing--
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.000]   - See, they turned.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:43.840]   - Camera, thank you.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.680]   - It's a camera, thank you.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.520]   - And camera.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:46.360]   - They heard us.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.000]   - They put my palm on there, uh-oh.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:48.840]   - Uh-oh.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.280]   - So you can actually draw,
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:54.560]   I mean actually draw on the screen.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:57.160]   - Palm rejection is obviously critical on this.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.520]   - It was terrific, that was one of the things
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.960]   I tested the most at the event.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.800]   - Yeah, it actually tested.
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:01.640]   - I just went to test it.
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:03.120]   - I'm gonna say close up how fast it is
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.120]   and drag it and you can do that.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:06.760]   But it's a life treat, you can use your fingers
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:10.040]   to watch and stretch and, oh yeah, you can zoom it
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:10.880]   in and out.
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:15.360]   - But when I actually draw on, that's cool.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:18.320]   And she in here, look too slow, it's a crappy guy.
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.520]   When I'm on screen I--
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:22.560]   - It looks pretty instant.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.400]   - Yeah, it was really good.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.440]   - And we're actually using Procreate right now.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.440]   - This is a special version of Procreate for the--
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.200]   - Ah, I guess it also depends on the camera.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:33.840]   But to use how fast it is,
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.600]   maybe there's some processing involved.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.040]   - And they do a lot of, like,
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:39.920]   they try to predict where you're gonna go
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.200]   and once in a while you'll see it,
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.920]   like not do it correctly and then redraw.
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.640]   But most of the time it's really good.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:47.000]   - How interesting is that?
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.360]   - Can they just predict, like, the entire drawing?
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.480]   - Yeah, just predict the monkey.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.320]   - And I--
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.400]   - Yeah, predict the monkey.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.480]   - You need to be able to predict it
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:58.040]   with a certain, you know, artist in mind.
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.400]   So predict it like Picasso or predict it like,
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:03.360]   gosh, I wish I could draw like that.
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:04.200]   - Oh yeah, this is--
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.240]   - Wouldn't that be fun to be able to just draw stuff like that?
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.160]   - It really did feel like a real pencil.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:09.880]   That was the thing that was different from Wacom
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.920]   and from the galaxy notes that I've used.
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.760]   It felt like drawing with a pencil.
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.360]   - And you do a lot of that, so you would know.
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:19.800]   I mean, it's good to give it to the artists.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.360]   - And I used Wacom for a decade.
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.760]   It just doesn't feel the same.
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:23.760]   - No, 'cause it's not direct.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.520]   You're not drawing, oh, he tried to use the eraser.
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:30.240]   Whoops, whoops, there's no eraser.
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.720]   - I'm gonna press the darker--
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:32.720]   - Yeah, the pressure's in the video
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.160]   should be pretty well.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.520]   When I talk to the other engineer,
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:37.960]   these pins are not
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.560]   on the right for the same response as the Wacom pins,
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.120]   but they're the drawing clarity.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.520]   'Cause the Wacom have us have a rougher surface.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:48.480]   - Yeah, look at that.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:51.360]   - And the rougher surface gives you a little bit more grit.
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:52.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.320]   - But I'm gonna feel it.
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:54.600]   - Yeah.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:58.960]   - Is it the actual glasses that's on the screen?
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:00.720]   - Yeah, yeah, so the end of the thing is,
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:03.040]   it's not as rough as the sentiques,
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.120]   but the picture is just better.
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:05.960]   - Right.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:07.440]   - Look how fast you can fit those things around.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.280]   - Yeah.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.120]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:10.880]   - Yeah, a lot of people--
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:12.880]   - I thought artists were like one of the difficulties
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.400]   they have with the Wacom tablets,
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:16.720]   is that they draw on a sheet of paper,
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.880]   but they're always turning the paper around
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:19.880]   to get the right angle,
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.160]   so they don't have to keep croaking their arms.
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.000]   So.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000]   (laughing)
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.800]   - Would we have a better idea of when this is gonna arrive
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:28.640]   just November?
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:29.480]   - Early November, yeah.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.320]   - Early November.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.160]   - That's better.
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:32.000]   - Well, before Thanksgiving.
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.840]   (laughing)
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:36.520]   - I mean, they have to get it to market.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.680]   - Eventually. - Eventually.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.080]   - No one there is gonna wanna do that in there.
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:39.920]   - Yeah.
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.760]   - Yeah.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:42.960]   All right, get your picks ready folks.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:43.960]   Back of the book coming up,
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.440]   but first a word from Squarespace.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.600]   Squarespace builds it beautiful.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.000]   You know, we had,
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.560]   well, new screensavers we had that Jason Calicanis on,
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.680]   and somebody had sent us a question about,
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.360]   you know, how to know who to hire to design your website.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.960]   And Jason said you'd be nuts
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:03.680]   to design your own website these days.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.080]   He said, the companies like Squarespace,
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.320]   and he used Squarespace as a specific example,
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.560]   now have templates that are as good as,
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.880]   if not better than any designer out there.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.200]   They're mobile responsive, they're totally customizable.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:19.280]   They look fantastic.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.240]   He says, you're crazy to, you know,
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:24.520]   hire somebody to basically duplicate this effort.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:25.760]   The Squarespace is done.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.320]   And it starts at $8 a month when you sign up for a year.

[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:49.920]   a restaurant that wants just look as good as your food tastes,
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.280]   Squarespace builds it beautiful.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.680]   And man, is it reliable?
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:57.520]   You just can't bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:00.080]   The best hosting, the best software,
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.720]   mobile responsive design automatically built in,
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:05.600]   the e-commerce built into every site.

[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.880]   Callicana said it.
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.520]   You shouldn't, don't reinvent the wheel.
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:50.360]   Squarespace is there, squarespace.com,

[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:00.200]   All right, time for our picks of the week.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.760]   Did they warn you that we would be doing a pick of the week?
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:04.000]   - I have one. - Well then why don't you
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.400]   do the honors Chris Mark for?
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:08.040]   - Okay, so I have two wrists.
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:09.640]   - One does. - One has the Apple watch.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.240]   - One would. - One has this one.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.760]   - What is that? - Well this is a...
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.360]   - It's a fitness band, I could tell.
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:20.440]   - It's the Xiaomi Mi Band, which is, I think,
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.800]   the cheapest one on the market right now.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.240]   It's like 15 to 20 bucks.
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:28.400]   It does the usual step tracking and of course
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:30.200]   those two don't agree. - You put it right here.
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.880]   - Yeah, those two do not agree.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.720]   It comes out here, it's a little pill that's all...
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:35.960]   - How close are they?
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:38.400]   - That's all complete, oh here we go.
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.640]   This is what you put in the band, it's waterproof,
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:44.440]   you can swim and shower with it, no problem.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:45.680]   But the interesting thing is,
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.400]   or two interesting things about it is,
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:52.040]   it does sleep tracking and it does sleep cycle alarm.
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.040]   So it looks at what... - Oh I like that.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.280]   - What your depth of sleep is,
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.640]   and when you're not in deep sleep,
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.000]   it'll wake up within a half hour window
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.040]   before you set the...
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:06.080]   In the half hour window before your alarm should go off
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:08.200]   and it does it by vibrating.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.000]   - So you say eight o'clock and it waits to see
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.800]   when you're in a lighter sleep cycle and then...
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.160]   - It starts between seven, 30 and eight o'clock
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:15.200]   and looks when you're lighter sleep and wakes you up
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.200]   by vibrating so you don't have to wake up
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:20.040]   your significant other because it just...
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.680]   - You know what, it's so cheap.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.040]   - 20 dollars? - 20 dollars.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.280]   - It's cheap and... - It can't be right.
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:30.520]   - It runs on one charge, it runs three to four weeks.
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.040]   - So it does have a charger?
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.040]   - It comes with a charger,
[01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:34.760]   it has these two little contacts you see here.
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:36.000]   - But that's gonna last you a month.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.480]   - And those are...
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.440]   It comes with a little USB dongle thing.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:40.600]   - What's the software look like?
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:41.920]   Does it have decent software?
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:46.280]   - It does, it comes with an iPhone app.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:49.920]   I think it can do more on Android
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.880]   like notifications for calls and things,
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:55.680]   but here's a little app and you get to set an alarm
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:58.800]   and switch on what's called the early bird alarm
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:03.800]   so you get the trekking thing and it sings,
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:08.200]   it sings your sleep, it gives you statistics
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:13.200]   over how you moved, it puts that data into Apple Health.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:15.560]   - And it automatically knows that you're sleeping,
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:16.880]   you don't have to press a button or anything.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.400]   - It does that and it has been pretty good so far.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.720]   Really nice little thing, doesn't cost much.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:27.320]   It's below that threshold where you'd go,
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.880]   "Man, if I shouldn't work."
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:31.200]   - It was one of those instant buys for me
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:34.840]   and then it has three little LEDs on here.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:39.360]   So it's like on a MacBook next to the camera,
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:43.800]   like little holes drilled in so you can't really see anything
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.720]   unless the LEDs go on and through those
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:47.680]   it will give you some status information.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.520]   So that was a no-brainer to buy
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.520]   and then you can have different color bands and things.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:57.880]   Super cheap, does the job, vibrates, battery lasts long.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.920]   So for me that's really one of those things
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.400]   that now has replaced my alarm clock.
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.880]   - Well that's remarkable, IP67 water resistant.
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:07.680]   That's so you're showering, no problem.
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.120]   Heat to 70 degrees centigrade.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:14.120]   You'd be dead before the band would in other words.
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:15.560]   - Probably. - 20 below.
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:18.080]   That's nice. - So I--
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:19.160]   - 20 bucks.
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:20.760]   - Can you, let me see if you can get it on Amazon.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:22.840]   - Oh yes you can. - If you have an Android device,
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:25.040]   it'll unlock the phone and it'll give you
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:26.400]   incoming call alerts.
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.760]   That's kind of neat.
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.720]   - Yeah, it's a bit more limited on iOS
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:33.840]   but really the functionality I really wanted for
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:36.840]   is the alarm clock with the sleep tracking.
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:39.480]   - Works really well.
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:40.800]   - Me band.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.400]   20 bucks.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.240]   Sold, good.
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:47.880]   Andy Inaco, your pick of the week.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:51.040]   - My pick is where I am right now.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.880]   I needed to find a space where I could do this podcast
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:57.200]   and of course you've heard about places
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:00.160]   where you can rent like an office conference room
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:02.280]   for an hour or so.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:04.040]   But when my Twitter followers actually recommended
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:06.320]   this place, this thing called Breather,
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:11.200]   breather.com, it's a lot like Zipcar
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:14.640]   in that you download this app and in a few cities
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:18.520]   like Boston, New York, Providence, Rhode Island,
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:21.320]   San Francisco, you just simply, it shows you
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:23.720]   all these different conference rooms and offices
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:25.280]   that are available in that city.
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.880]   And through the app you can rent it
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.480]   for anywhere from a half an hour
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:30.880]   all the way to several several hours.
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:34.680]   And you get there and you use the phone app
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.880]   to actually unlock the door.
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.880]   There's a pin code that's protected by it.
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:39.840]   So you just simply show up, go into your room.
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:42.760]   You can do it on like 10, 15 minutes notice even.
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.400]   And it's a pretty good space.
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.400]   I'll sort of show you.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:49.480]   This space here, I got for,
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:54.040]   I got for, it's cost me a little bit more than $80
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.720]   for three hours.
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:59.240]   And you got a sofa, you can sit down, it's got a table,
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:02.160]   you got yourself a lamp, you got yourself wifi
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:05.280]   that's clearly good enough for to do Skype.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:07.000]   At least it's stable for three hours.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.200]   Here's a whiteboard.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:11.560]   And also, I didn't notice 'cause it was behind me.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:15.440]   I got a complimentary graduated cylinder
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.160]   of free candies there.
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:20.960]   So there won't be many, there won't be these left
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.520]   because that's your own.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:25.520]   But it's, I'm glad I know about this
[01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:27.840]   because I'm in New York a lot.
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:31.760]   I'm in other cities that are covered by breather a lot.
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:33.840]   And there are times where I don't want to,
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.320]   there haven't times where I actually had to take a hotel room
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:39.440]   just because I needed for four hours a meeting place
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:42.080]   or a place to simply sit and do some work
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:43.520]   that was gonna be reliable.
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:45.400]   And then left after four or five hours
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.280]   and spent $250 for it.
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.240]   So the ability to be in one of these cities,
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:52.240]   I know that my train home isn't until 2 a.m.
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:56.600]   I just need one hour to sit down and close my eyes
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:58.080]   and not even like stretch out and nap,
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:02.520]   but just not sleep, but just like for 20 minutes,
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:05.820]   just like close my eyes and sort of re-energize myself.
[01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:08.040]   And just to be able to spontaneously just,
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:11.080]   here's a space for $17.50.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:13.880]   I can have a half hour in this place
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.180]   and do what I need to get done.
[01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:17.360]   There's some simple rules.
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.120]   Basically on the other side, it says,
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:20.560]   just don't do anything in this office
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:23.480]   that you wouldn't do in an actual real office.
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.480]   The place is clean.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:27.440]   Like as soon as I booked until 4.30,
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:28.520]   as soon as I'm out of here,
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:31.080]   there will be a cleaning crew in here to tidy things up
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:32.400]   and put the chairs back where they were.
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:35.680]   And hopefully refill this now absolutely gonna be
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:37.720]   completely empty, graduated cylinder
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.640]   full of Tootsie rolls.
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:40.560]   So it's really, really cool.
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:43.520]   Again, it's easy to find places you can book like
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:45.720]   on a week's notice, a couple of weeks notice.
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:47.880]   It's harder to simply have a resource
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.120]   so that if you find that I just need an hour,
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:52.280]   I need two hours, I need a half hour
[01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:54.520]   of a quiet room with wifi and electricity
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:57.040]   and air conditioning and privacy, here it is.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:00.520]   And you can just simply do that for 17.50
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:03.760]   for a half hour in some of these spaces.
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.200]   That's cheap money.
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:06.040]   - Nice.
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:10.080]   Is it all over the country?
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:11.800]   You probably said.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:15.120]   - No, it's only about a half dozen cities so far,
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.360]   but like in New York, they're all over the place.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:21.240]   I actually, I picked this place because I wanted to go get
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:24.640]   comic books afterward, it's kind of near right by comics.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:26.840]   But there was actually, I kind of felt foolish
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.320]   because I had to kind of run to get here in time.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:31.680]   And there was a place like literally across the street
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:33.880]   from where the Microsoft event was.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.880]   And there were like dozens and dozens of these places.
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:38.320]   And there are in like regular office building.
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.520]   So it's like, it's not like Airbnb
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:44.320]   where you're using somebody's, you know,
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:47.160]   somebody's spare bedroom or something like this.
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:49.320]   So as I said, it's the first time I used it,
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:51.840]   I'm a happy customer and I'm sure I'm gonna be using it again
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.680]   when I'm in New York.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:55.320]   - There you go.
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.760]   An unusual pick from Andy and I go.
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:59.760]   Let us. - Give me a whole building.
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:00.640]   That's my pick.
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:02.200]   - That is a whole building.
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:03.200]   - Pop that.
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:05.280]   Finally something more expensive than anything Alex
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.120]   has ever picked.
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:06.960]   - New York, your real estate.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:07.800]   - Wait, wait.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:09.680]   - Like Mark says that anything Alex has ever picked.
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:11.040]   (laughing)
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.120]   - Let's give him a chance.
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.240]   Let's give him a chance.
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:16.680]   Alex Lindsey, can you top that?
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:18.480]   - So I do, I'm not gonna top it.
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:19.600]   I'm not gonna get close to it.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:23.000]   But one of the things I was talking to someone about
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.120]   is how we go through site surveys.
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:27.160]   So I have to probably once a week,
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:29.560]   sometimes twice a week, I'm at some location
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.760]   that we're gonna do an event sometime in the future.
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:34.200]   And I have to gather a whole bunch of information,
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.040]   you know, about that.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.040]   And that comes down to how big everything is.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.480]   And can I see satellites and everything else?
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:42.640]   And so I thought I'd list just the two apps that I use,
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.320]   probably the most for those.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:49.320]   One is called My Measures Pro, I think is the one I have.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.000]   And what it does is it lets you take photos
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.400]   and then you can draw a little,
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:56.320]   you can take your hand and put little arrows
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.160]   between everything.
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:58.720]   So a lot of times I'm there with it.
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:00.560]   So if you're ever like, need to figure out
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.520]   how big your room is or you're trying to figure out
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:04.440]   a building or your apartment,
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.960]   My Measures Pro is really hard to do this well
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:10.000]   and I bought almost all of them,
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.000]   all the different ways to do it.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.760]   And I found this one to be the easiest one to use.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.200]   And so you take a bunch of photos
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:15.840]   and then you're there with your,
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:21.000]   you're typically a measuring tape and a laser measure.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.560]   And I can sit there and do all of those things
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.200]   and then just simply add them all to this.
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:26.760]   And the input is fairly easy.
[01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.080]   And that's the hard part of getting this right,
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:30.840]   is that you just, you can kind of very quickly
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.560]   add those arrows, tap on it, add the dimensions.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.400]   And it turns, it's just,
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:38.560]   if it isn't really, really easy to use,
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.240]   you won't use it onsite.
[01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:43.080]   And so, this is the one I use onsite anyway.
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.800]   So of all the ones that I've used,
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:47.880]   this is the one that I'm definitely the happiest with,
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:49.520]   the other app that I use a lot,
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:51.720]   which is a little bit geekier,
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:56.720]   is called, it's called DPARPro.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:59.760]   And this is a little bit more geeky for everyone.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.320]   The first one will probably be more useful for people,
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:04.520]   but DPARPro is an app that lets you see
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:05.600]   where the satellites are.
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.760]   So if you stand up on someone's roof,
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:09.600]   I use this a lot last week in the rain in New York.
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.040]   And, but you can point up into the sky
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:16.040]   and it's using your direction and everything else
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.320]   to kind of give you a rough idea
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:20.040]   of where specifically Galaxy 17 is,
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:21.600]   which is usually the one that I need to find.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:24.440]   So, you can get kind of angles
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:25.720]   and figure out where everything is
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:27.120]   and figure out whether you're gonna be able
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:28.960]   to put a dish up there and make it work.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:31.040]   So, so anyway, I thought that that would be kind of fun.
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:33.920]   The only other thing that's a piece of hardware that we use,
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.400]   that I use a lot is the Theta,
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.560]   which is, I think I've recommended in the past,
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:39.440]   which is you take one photo and it takes--
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:40.840]   - I ordered the Theta S.
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:41.840]   - I can't wait to get there.
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:43.200]   - I'm very excited about the Theta S.
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:45.840]   I have a bunch of the, or a couple of the Theta,
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.760]   I think M15s or something like that,
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:51.240]   but which is the last version, which is great.
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:53.240]   And the Theta S is gonna be even better,
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:54.800]   but what's great is you just kind of hold it up
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:57.080]   and take a photo and now you have,
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:57:58.400]   you can kind of put that into,
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:57:59.880]   you can use it with your goggles,
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.720]   but you can really, they have a viewer as well,
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:02.640]   that you can kind of look around
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:04.720]   when you're talking about where you're gonna put stuff
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:06.000]   or how you're gonna plan something.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.960]   So, but those are the three tools
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:11.760]   that I probably use the most on SiteSurface.
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:14.880]   And so I figured out that would be my collection of picks
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:17.360]   today, they make more sense together than apart.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.040]   - Nice.
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:22.280]   We'll put these all somewhere in the show notes.
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:24.000]   There's a lot of stuff.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.040]   - Yeah, that was a bunch of stuff.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:26.720]   - A lot of stuff.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:28.680]   - And we still haven't heard from Renee Ritchie.
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:30.440]   I'm where.com, what's your pick?
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:33.160]   Don't say the Hermes watch.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:34.960]   - I gotta do it Leo, because we didn't talk about it.
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:38.160]   And it's something so interesting to me because it,
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:39.760]   and Johnny I've did an interview about it
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:42.080]   where he talked about the sort of fashion culture.
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.240]   And this isn't for everybody.
[01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:44.840]   A lot of people will be super happy
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.800]   and get more out of an Apple Watch sport,
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.520]   which is incredibly inexpensive.
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.400]   But there is people, just like there are people
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.560]   who will only ever buy a gold watch
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:54.520]   because it's their lifestyle,
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:57.320]   the way they buy $20,000 dresses and wear it once,
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:58:59.240]   or use stay in five-star hotels,
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.400]   or $20,000 tickets to the Emirates.
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:04.640]   There are people for whom Hermes is what they wanna wear.
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:06.240]   And I mentioned before, my boss Kevin
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.880]   has been wearing Hermes leather bracelets for years.
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:11.120]   So, and they find this stuff really compelling.
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:13.000]   Apple sold out of a lot of the models
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.360]   relatively quickly yesterday from what I understand.
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:18.480]   So this takes the same basic stainless steel Apple Watch.
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:20.680]   It does have a Hermes branding on the back of it
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:22.240]   and puts it together with Hermes,
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:24.480]   with Hermes leather.
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:26.080]   And that comes from their history
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:29.400]   of making leather for a salary in Bridal wear.
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:30.600]   They've got several different kinds.
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:33.800]   There's a single tour, which is basically like a leather strap.
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:35.960]   And there's a double tour, which goes around twice.
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:40.040]   And there's a, sorry, a cuff,
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:41.720]   which is a sort of very wide one
[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:43.200]   that was very popular in the '70s.
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:46.760]   And Europe apparently is quite popular again.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:48.320]   And it's definitely a luxury item.
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:50.200]   It's definitely not for everybody,
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:51.720]   but for people who do pay several hundred,
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:55.720]   not thousands of dollars for Hermes leather jewelry.
[01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.320]   It's a really interesting product.
[01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:58.720]   It comes with a custom watch face
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:01.280]   that actually fills up the square display
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:05.480]   on the Apple Watch better than the other analog watch faces.
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:08.160]   And it does support the heart rate monitor.
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.360]   There's a lot of, you can get it in the brown,
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:13.800]   the gray, the red and the blue color.
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:14.920]   And it's interesting to me.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:17.360]   It's interesting to see Apple sort of experiment
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.320]   with the fashion brands.
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:19.400]   And as much as we say, you know,
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:22.200]   companies aren't willing to take risks anymore.
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.480]   This might blow up in their face.
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:24.840]   This might not be a good path for them.
[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:26.680]   But I find it interesting that they're willing
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:28.440]   to at least experiment with it.
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:31.360]   And I don't know if we'll see different fashion houses
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:35.280]   team up with Apple once a year or on different occasions.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:37.840]   But it is an attempt to take technology
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.560]   beyond where we usually find it.
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:43.200]   And instead of Hermes making their own really bad digital
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:45.520]   or sort of computational watch based on,
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:47.560]   you know, open source software or something.
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:50.360]   Without a lot of forethought, they get an Apple Watch.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.800]   And Apple gets sort of into Hermes doors and brands
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.080]   and into that sort of lifestyle.
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:57.000]   And again, win or lose I think is super interesting.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.760]   And I'm curious to see where it goes.
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:01.600]   So these started at $100,000.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:04.200]   - What a man where the double tour or is that really?
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.120]   - It's not available for the 42 millimeters,
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.080]   only available for the 38 millimeter.
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.000]   The cuff is only available for 42
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.600]   and the single tour is available for both.
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:13.920]   - That's interesting.
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:15.200]   All right.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.280]   - So again, not for everybody,
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:17.640]   but for people who do like Hermes,
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:19.320]   it just gives them the option of having an Apple Watch.
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:21.560]   - And apparently sold out everywhere.
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:22.720]   You can't-- - I think the single tour
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:23.560]   is available.
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:25.480]   I think the cuff is the one that we would like that.
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.960]   - You can't, the cuff went fast.
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:28.960]   - Yeah.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.280]   - Who would have thought it?
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:32.680]   You can't just go in any old Apple store.
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:34.480]   In fact, it's very limited availability.
[02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:38.760]   There are Hermes stores in Beverly Hills, of course,
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:41.120]   in Miami and in San Francisco.
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:42.120]   - Love it.
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:42.960]   - Love it.
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:44.320]   - No riff-raff.
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:45.720]   - But-- - It's your riff-raff,
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:47.600]   go to the mall, go to the Apple store.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.960]   We don't want your kind at the Hermes store.
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:51.520]   - No. - Yeah.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:55.160]   - You should wear a floral lastimer band, I think.
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:57.120]   - The blue one. - The blue one, probably,
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:01.760]   maybe pink, if you're a boy, blue if you're a girl.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:03.960]   But a few stores, a limited number of stores
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:07.040]   in LA, Miami, San Francisco, New York, and Toronto.
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:09.600]   - What's interesting is they had a bunch of new Apple Watch ads
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:11.440]   that started airing, I think, on Sunday night.
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:13.640]   And in one of them, Lake Bell, who did the voiceover
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.520]   for the new iPhone commercial and did that movie in a world,
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.320]   she's dancing in one of them and she's wearing
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:23.720]   not the gold Apple Watch, but the gold anodized Apple Watch sport.
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:25.040]   So there's obviously a wide range
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:27.440]   of how they're marketing these.
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.720]   - There you go, ladies.
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:30.120]   I'm not even gonna bother with a pic.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:33.680]   You guys have just, you own the pic space.
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:35.600]   You are the kings of pics.
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.440]   - Pick that campus that Apple is leasing,
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:39.560]   and then you have something more expensive than a not-coast.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.040]   (laughing)
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:44.800]   - What is the El Capitan slogan?
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:46.640]   (laughing)
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:47.480]   - More to love with every click.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.400]   - More to love with every pic.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:50.320]   - Pick.
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:51.160]   - Fortunately.
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:54.600]   - Or something else, just depends.
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.400]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:58.680]   Chris Markwater, we just love your stuff.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.760]   I appreciate your weekly appearances on the radio show.
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:02.600]   - Thanks for having me.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:03.440]   - Everybody should listen to the tips
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:06.160]   from the top floor, TFTTF.com.
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:07.000]   - That's where you can go.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:07.920]   - Is that right?
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:09.760]   TFTTF.com.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:11.360]   - Yeah, it's very intuitive.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:12.800]   And he's a dick that 10 years ago.
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:14.280]   You've been doing it 10 years.
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:15.440]   - Doing this for over 10 years now.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.280]   - Over 10 years, it's so nice.
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.200]   And of course, discover the top floor if you wanna see.
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:22.880]   Is there any room in here in New York?
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:23.880]   - The New York workshop.
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:25.240]   - I think that's actually sold out,
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:28.600]   but there's one coming up in January, Ethiopia,
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:29.440]   which we still--
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:30.280]   - Ethiopia.
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:33.600]   - Ethiopia, one of the most misunderstood countries in Africa.
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:37.000]   Beautiful, amazing, diverse place.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.040]   So that is really a very high my list to go back to.
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:43.000]   - So just go to discoverthetopfloor.com.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.680]   There's lots to see there.
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:46.760]   - Oh yes.
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:48.960]   - Ethiopia experiences coming up like by car.
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.800]   - It's just like be very large.
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:52.080]   We go into the law of what in Norway, beautiful islands,
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:53.080]   the Fjords.
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:54.080]   - Go back to Ireland.
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:55.160]   That looked like it was a lot of fun.
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.480]   - Ireland was amazing.
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:58.800]   It was a wonderful learning experience for everyone,
[02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:00.960]   including myself.
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:04.080]   Shot a lot of landscape, sea scapes,
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:07.240]   long exposures, beautiful.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:08.720]   I mean, just the weather there.
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:11.920]   It changes like five times in one hour.
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:13.760]   It's a bit of a challenge,
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:17.160]   but after that you can do it.
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:19.320]   - Chris is a film buff as well,
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:21.000]   and you do analog workshops for people
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.440]   who want to still shoot film work.
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:23.800]   - We've just experienced it.
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:25.480]   - My fiance and I have just written a book
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:28.840]   about film photography in Germany,
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.680]   but it's in the process of being translated.
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:32.680]   So it'll come out
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:35.920]   first quarter next year,
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:40.280]   hopefully publishing this with Rocky Nook actually.
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:43.240]   So it will be on the American market,
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:45.720]   which I'm really glad for.
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:46.720]   I'm really happy for it.

[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:02.480]   You're gonna take some pictures the rest of the day?
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:04.080]   - I took some pictures yesterday.
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:06.080]   I'm actually just getaddling back tonight

[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:22.760]   that's Plus that have not been taken by other reviewers.
