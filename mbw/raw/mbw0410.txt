[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.760]   here.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.880]   We're going to talk about Apple's indestructible new sapphire display.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.120]   The glass looks amazing.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.720]   We'll see if it really works on the phone itself.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.760]   We're going to talk about Tim Cook's Apple.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.640]   He's been in charge for three years, and how has the company changed in those three years?
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.960]   And we're going to talk about the eye watch, of course.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.480]   Apple's made an interesting hire, which sort of changes the whole picture for their coming
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.240]   watch and even for the marketing for the whole company.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.760]   It's all coming up right now on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.160]   world of Apple.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.680]   And with me is the usual cast of characters.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.480]   I, of course, am not Leo LaPorte.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.920]   I am Mike Elgin, the news director here at Twit, and I'm sitting in for him while he's
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.680]   on vacation, taking it easy.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.040]   And we're working hard here at the Twit Studios.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.320]   With me is, we'll start with Andy Anaco.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.560]   Andy Anaco is with the Chicago Sun Times, and he's a technology columnist there.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.400]   And welcome Andy Anaco.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.120]   It is very nice to be here being welcomed by you, Mike.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.120]   Thank you so much.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.040]   And I was impressed by your extreme knowledge and distaste for Haggis before we started
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   the show.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.520]   So that was an interesting conversation that you all missed.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.120]   Well, I'm proud of it because I've never had Haggis.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.680]   So it's based solely on ignorance and arrogance, which is a very American thing to do just
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.040]   so soon after July 4.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.720]   Well, thank you for waving the flag.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.200]   And I guess that's the right way to do.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.640]   Eventually, we'll have a food show here.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   Mark my words.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.560]   We will someday have a food show here on the Twit Network.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.200]   And we should have a Haggis day where we all wear kilts and talk about food we've never
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   tried.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.760]   So that's something to look forward to.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.600]   Renee Ritchie is with us as well.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.920]   Of course, he runs I'm More and is a serial podcaster and podcasts and hosts a lot of podcasts
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   then with the word cast.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   Welcome Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.360]   As someone whose family hails from Edinburgh, you know, the fighting sept of the clan Macintosh,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.440]   I'm appalled by all this anti-scotishism on this show.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.440]   Have you tried Haggis?
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.920]   No, I have not.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.440]   OK, well, there you go.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.440]   I have.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.760]   Well, it's so you're, you know, that's, you see, Canadians always try to pretend like
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.400]   they're so different from Americans, but you haven't tried Haggis either.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.600]   So it's too cold here to make Haggis mine.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Yeah, it's a good point.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   Good point.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   It's got oatmeal in it.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   I mean, come on.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.960]   So with us, Alex Lindsay of he of Pixelcore fame and welcome back to the United States
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   of America.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   Thank you.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.680]   And you were in Rwanda celebrating a very, very major event there.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.640]   Yeah, it was the 20th anniversary of the end of the genocide.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.800]   So and basically their Independence Day, which is July 4th as well.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.920]   So so there's a big event at the stadium and it was quite a thing.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.000]   You know, events in stadiums in Africa are a bunch of different than here.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.240]   You know, people started.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.240]   It was a mate.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.120]   Like we walked out while we were working on camera angles with our camera operators.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.720]   And the event doesn't start until 11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.800]   The people start coming at six.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.680]   So they're all the whole stadium is full by eight.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.680]   And then they all just start singing.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   Like it was just like, you know, they're not all saying like one section will start
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.520]   singing something and someone else was like, I don't know, you know, some of it was religious
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.960]   and some it was patriotic and some of it was probably just fun, but it was just like these,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.960]   these random, you know, it was quite a.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.920]   It's fun, it's just like literally a whole section.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.920]   And they're going.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.920]   I mean, they're moving there.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.920]   They're jumping up and down and singing and everything else.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.320]   And it's just a, I was just like, oh, they're way cooler than we are.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.280]   Well, and also we've got the question engine going for the show today.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.280]   So you're managing that.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   So if you want to ask a question, how do they do that?
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.800]   It go to, I believe it is a twit.to slash mbw410.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   Is that right?
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.240]   Twit.to dot.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240]   Sorry.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   Is twit.to slash mbw410.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.240]   And you can ask ask questions or make comments.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.000]   You can vote stuff up and down.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.240]   You can let us know, you know what you want us to talk about.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   So it's, so, so.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.240]   Yep, that link works well.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.960]   So there it is.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.440]   So and you can, of course, as he said, watch the show live there as well.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.600]   So I've got something for us all to sing about spontaneously.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.760]   I don't know if you've seen the video created by Marques Brownlee.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.360]   Marques Brownlee of course is a very well known YouTube personality who he tests a lot
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.520]   of mobile devices.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.560]   He does some really nice videos reviewing phones especially.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.000]   And he posted a video yesterday showing what he says is an iPhone 6 screen made with sapphire
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.600]   and he was shanking it with a knife pretty hard there and scratching with the keys and
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   the thing came up.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   That's a technical term, Mike.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   Yes, it is.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.520]   I learned it in prison.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.160]   But he did a pretty abusive test on this screen.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.040]   Again, just the screen, not, not a whole phone behind it, just the, just the so-called
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.840]   sapphire screen.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.480]   And it didn't have a mark on it.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   He was bending it.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   He was stepping on it.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.720]   He was just stabbing it with a knife, a very sharp knife.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.400]   And this looked very impressive.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.800]   He also, in this part of the videos we're seeing here, how did you watch the video?
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   He didn't say.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.000]   He got it from Sonny Dixon who's in Australia who has his first day with the Chinese parts
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   of the suppliers.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   That's right.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   He did say.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.640]   He also talked about the clarity and that was a point of controversy about sapphire.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.920]   Of course, that people were saying it was going to not, not let enough light through
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.200]   and it was inferior to regular glass or guerrilla glass.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.120]   But this looks pretty good.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.480]   What do you think about this, Renee Ritchie?
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.040]   Is this going to be transformative for the iPhone, assuming that this is legit?
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.640]   I mean, it's a little bit like reviewing that brand new Lego block that's going to ship
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.400]   later this month with that brand new Lego set in that it's completely out of context.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.040]   And it can be a magnificent new Lego block.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.600]   But like you pointed out, there's a lot of questions not attached to a phone yet.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.200]   I think on the face of it, it looks great.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.760]   Sonny Dixon has a great reputation for getting legitimate apple parts from the Chinese supply
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   chain.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.160]   So I mean, it's likely that it's an authentic part, whether it's a final part or not, it's
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.920]   hard to say.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.200]   But sapphire glass, I mean, a lot of experts have said for a long time that that is where
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.680]   we need to go to have the sort of large size, thin size, strength and flexibility that we
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.680]   need.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.280]   And based on Marquez's test, it looks like we're getting that.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   And of course, sapphire glass has been in use by Apple in front of the camera and also
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.780]   touch ID fingerprint reader, where it's very important to have a very accurate and very
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.600]   durable and those scratches and so on.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   So they've been using this for a while.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.640]   There've been reports for seems like more than a year about Apple hoarding sapphire
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.160]   and right building plants and hiring people and they've got patents and so on.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.080]   One of the interesting patents, they've also made an acquisition or two around sapphire
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   production.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.920]   And they've got interesting patents that they have, which is a patent for sapphire laminate,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.440]   which the idea of you have a very thin layer of sapphire bonded to a piece of glass, which
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.200]   enables the part to be thinner, lighter and clearer.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.600]   And we don't know whether this is an example of a sapphire laminate or not.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.440]   We really don't know what this technology is exactly.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:53.760]   But do we think that Andy and Aco whether this is something that is going to be revolutionary
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:00.480]   and difficult to copy by other companies, Android handset makers, for example?
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.440]   Hard to say because as tough as that thing is, the question is how tough does that have
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   to be?
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.240]   We're watching them bend it over the tip of his shoe right now and essentially there
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.760]   are things inside the iPhone that are not as flexible as that and they will break along
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.680]   before you do that.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.120]   I've got my phones in my pocket.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.200]   I've got also a Nexus 5 that I carry usually inside my pocket with no screen protector on
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   it.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.720]   And that doesn't have really any scratches on it after about a year of daily carry.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.840]   So it's great that they're choosing the superlative product.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.360]   Anything that will protect the screen and keep this thing looking pretty is going to
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.520]   be good for users.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.120]   I'm actually there are two things that I that are larger take away from this video for
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.120]   me.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.800]   Well, we're seeing this is this is usually the time of year when we would expect to start
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.600]   seeing parts kind of slip out of security and make some of these September and October
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.280]   announcements look more real.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.160]   So now I don't think there's anybody who would doubt that this is going to be the size of
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.240]   one of the one of the new iPhones.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:05.000]   The second thing is as I kept looking closely at that video, I couldn't help but notice
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.480]   that the corners of that screen are not squared off.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.360]   There's that cover they're not squared off.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.960]   They're rounded over, which made me think that if is this actually going to be part of
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.240]   the the actual profile of the finished product and they're making something so thin that
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.800]   they're not going to have a band of metal that encapsulates that cover that is going
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.280]   to be fastened over the actual display and that we're going to see sort of this little
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.320]   bubble effect that goes around the sides of it.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.960]   Who knows because as when I said we're seeing something completely out of context here,
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.200]   but that really does make the mind wonder a little bit.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.120]   For what it's worth two years ago, I heard that the iPhone 6 would have a similar design
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.080]   to the iPod touch and then last year, that because of all the new gestures like back
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.000]   gestures and stuff that they were experimenting with making the corners smoother so that when
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.360]   you do the bezel gestures, you wouldn't feel a sharp edge under your fingers.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.200]   And I think that one of the things that, you know, Apple, obviously this keeps on pushing
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.400]   that that the high end up.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.440]   So this is more expensive to make.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.320]   There's a lot of patents that slow people down.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   There's a lot of things that if someone is looking for the best phone they can possibly
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.840]   get, this is something that they may have to start adding.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.560]   It might be a feature that a lot of us are, you know, a lot of us have scratched up our
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.680]   phones, you know, often enough that that is something that people might buy against.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.360]   And you can, you know, a lot of the reports out in the last week have been about how Samsung
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.840]   is basically getting squeezed between Chinese manufacturers and an Apple, you know, where
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.920]   you have low end stuff coming up and the hot and Apple really looks like it's very focused
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:38.160]   on maintaining the top of the heap by continuing to add those technologies and making, you
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.600]   know, everybody else fight for the rest of the market, which might be a larger, but
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.560]   is lower, lower margin.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.960]   I just hope that this is a feature that will actually present itself to the users because
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.760]   phones are different.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.640]   You can spend, you can spend all this time and all this money engineering a beautiful
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.040]   design with all these cutting edge materials, but most people are still is going to slip
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.160]   it into a cheap $14 Hello Kitty rubber case.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.320]   And so you're not so none of that stuff worth you put in is going to actually present itself
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.320]   to the user.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.020]   So that's why, again, cool demo video.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.440]   This is something that you would expect to see from Apple.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.960]   But again, I wonder if a year from now we're going to see that this people actually care
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.360]   about this cover.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.520]   Apple, one of the one of the few things that Apple does during their keynote presentations
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.560]   that I think is kind of a misstep is that they will spend a lot, a lot more time that
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.200]   is necessary talking about this new welding technique or talking about this material they
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.360]   put into it.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.560]   And of course, this is something that is first and foremost on their minds as designers,
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.480]   but nobody really cares what this thing is made of as long as it feels good in the hand
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.080]   and so long as it has a good chance of surviving a drop onto a tile floor.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.440]   But they have to feed the hardcore enthusiasts.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.720]   And those are the people who are going to drive the excitement and stay faithful to the brand
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:53.600]   if they're given enough detail about all the sweat that went into this technology.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:00.440]   And of course, a lot of Apple's technology is manufacturing processes and this stuff
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.640]   is just invisible to the users as you say, but you end up with weird things that are just
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.360]   kind of vaguely thrilling if that's a possible surprise for example.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.120]   I'm not sure that I agree with you about the importance of satisfying hardcore enthusiasts
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.680]   because we forget that we've been with Apple so long that we always think ourselves at
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.960]   the Lost Tribe wandering through the desert.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.880]   In terms of when you talk about the iPhone though, Apple is making the Toyota Corolla.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.160]   They're making the most popular phone at least in the United States of America.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.440]   So they really are selling to generic.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.440]   I want a phone.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.320]   I expect to spend $200 for it.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.800]   I will walk into the store without much of a preconception I will buy whichever one strikes
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   my fancy.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:46.160]   So I'm not sure that this is the sort of thing that will appeal to the target iPhone user.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.240]   Apple fans will love it and eat it up.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.520]   People like us who appreciate things like that will eat it up.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.440]   But I'm not sure the person who just, "Hey, I dropped my phone to the toilet.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   What can I get?"
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   No.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.160]   But I think sometimes with artwork in general, we can call this technological artwork, the
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.600]   story is about half the value behind it.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.320]   So the story of what it takes to do is I just saw, I don't know if you've seen this as a
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.400]   documentary called Tim's Vameer.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.800]   Yeah, that's all that.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.040]   And Tim Jensen who actually invented or started TriCat, the company that makes TriCasters.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   Video toaster.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   A video toaster figured out how or figured out a way possible way that Vameer was made.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.440]   So I didn't even know who Vameer was.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.240]   I'm not very cultured.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.240]   I'm from Western Pennsylvania.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.960]   I know a lot about rifles and pistols and not so much about Vameer.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.360]   But after watching this documentary on my last flight, I was like, "I don't know everything
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   about Vameer.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   In fact, I want to try to do that."
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.880]   I was like, "I don't want to get my little things out and everything else."
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.360]   And the value, and then also the fact that it took them a year and a half to make one,
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.960]   creates an enormous amount of value of that painting where otherwise it's just a painting
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.960]   that I don't really understand.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.200]   So for those listening, what we're talking about is the theory that Vameer, who was a
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.120]   famous, he was Dutch, right?
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.120]   Dutch painter?
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.120]   Yes.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.640]   He used a contraption potentially of his own invention that used essentially to focus the
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.640]   light.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.200]   And his paintings were essentially traces.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   Some have even called them photographs because essentially it's projected.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.800]   The light is projected onto a flat surface where that could be captured in one method
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.000]   or another.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.200]   And this totally changes the way you look at Vermeer paintings.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   Right.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.240]   And it doesn't, I think that some people thought it would lower the value, but what it actually
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.160]   does is increase the value because you realize it's an incredible amount of work to do that
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   level of detail.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.640]   But the point that I'm making is not so much about Vameer, but is mostly about the fact
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.000]   that when we understand how hard it is to make these pieces, I think that it does change
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.280]   because the rest of the phones are just regular phones.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.520]   You know, like you don't know what that they just are objects.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.160]   So it's always the iPhone.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.160]   It is.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.240]   But I mean, part of the distortion field is created by story.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.160]   You know, it just bothers me a little bit.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.000]   I think Apple's really good at layering stuff.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.280]   I mean, they're very good at telling that deep story and it will resonate with geeks,
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.560]   but it'll also form sort of a backstory for everybody else.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.160]   And they'll say things like 64-bit double the registers.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.360]   It enables authentication technology like Touch ID.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   And you don't have to remember that.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.400]   You're a geek, you can, but when you go into the store, all you'll hear is 64-bit.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.640]   And that sounds like more bits.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   That's better.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.760]   And the same thing with this screen, you might hear about the manufacturing process, but
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.480]   at the end of the day, you'll walk into the store and go, Sapphire, does this guy have
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   Sapphire?
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.400]   No, Sapphire sounds better and expensive.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.120]   And it just creates sort of a multi-layered, I don't know if it's Shakespearean is the right
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.640]   term, but it creates a dialogue on multiple levels.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.280]   And I think that overall benefits them.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.880]   Andy and I, you started to say something.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   Did you have?
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.680]   Oh, only that.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   Only that.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:49.720]   And this is just a personal feeling that I don't think it matters how Vermeer painted
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   that painting.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.920]   It's a beautiful painting.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.840]   If you think that you're, if someone wants to look at that and say, "Oh, well, this didn't
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.720]   come strictly from his imagination.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   He did it.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.840]   Use a mechanical help," then you don't understand art.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.640]   Similarly, if you were not interested in the music lesson until you found out all the technology
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.880]   behind it, you also are not bringing anything to the art.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.720]   So that's why it's beautiful to hear the story about how Apple designs these things.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.760]   And also oftentimes when you're inside the keynote and you're listening to them talk
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.880]   about how they put this together, I don't denigrate them for that because it's an extension
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.680]   of the legitimate pride that they take in putting together these things.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.000]   It's just like if you ask me about a piece of furniture I made and I will tell you about
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.200]   all of it, let me tell you, let me show you how I put those dowels in because it's a very
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.440]   clever technique that allows me to do a very, very tight joint with because it's a certain
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.520]   amount of pride in what you did to get this together.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.920]   However, none of that should really matter to the person.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   This is a phone.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   It's used to place and receive phone calls.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.920]   It's used to surf the web.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.160]   It's used to keep in touch with your family and it's used to count your calories and your
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.480]   steps per day.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.120]   And if people, and if part of the story of why you should buy this phone instead of the
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.800]   other is that let me tell you about the technique we use to, let me help tell you about how
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   thin we made this.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.440]   Let me tell you about what we had to do for battery conservation in order to make a battery
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.520]   this thin last just as long as any other phone.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.520]   Nobody should care about that.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.240]   All they hear is this battery lasts as long as any other phone and then they should not
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.720]   care about anything beyond that.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.840]   So that's just something that personally I'm on guard against because I am the guy who
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.520]   wants to hear about the new A7, the new A8, the new A9 processor.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.080]   I really do want to hear about the assembly technique that lets them do something, put
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.560]   together something this tricky, but this, you have to focus on the things that are going
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.800]   to present themselves to an actual user.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800]   Absolutely.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.560]   And I tend to disagree on one level at least, which is that the cumulative effect of all
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.680]   the different things that Apple does, all the crazy manufacturing techniques and the
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:50.000]   obsession with materials and all that, it has an overarching effect of superior quality.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.760]   If you look at the fingerprint reader right out of the box, the first 1.0 release of their
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.200]   fingerprint reader, it just worked really well compared to every other fingerprint reader
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.000]   I've ever seen.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.800]   You have really nice materials.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.000]   I mean, you don't have this sort of thing.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.840]   This is my Moto X, which I dropped yesterday, a half an hour before I saw that Marquez video.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.560]   And I thought, "Huh, boy, wouldn't that be great?"
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.120]   I mean, there's a spectrum of possibilities with Sapphire.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.400]   One end of the spectrum is the bad news, which is if Corning is right, the people who make
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.520]   Gorilla Glass, that it will affect the battery life, it'll be a dimmer display, it'll create
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.480]   problems for the screen quality.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.440]   Because they have nothing to at stake.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.440]   Exactly.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.440]   Exactly.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.960]   And it's a competitor, essentially to grill glass theoretically.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   That's one end of the spectrum.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.560]   The other end of the spectrum is, "What if Apple really is onto something here and they
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.160]   have a display that will never scratch except under the most extreme conditions and that
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.640]   you can carry it around your pocket?"
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:49.800]   This makes a lot of sense for Apple simply because we talked about the Andy Anako, you
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.760]   talked about the Hello Kitty case.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.040]   What if they make a big deal at the announcement of this thing?
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.760]   What if one of the signature attributes of this device, of this phone, is you don't need
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   a case.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.280]   Apple says flat out, "You don't need a case for this.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.000]   You don't want to carry around the naked phone in your pocket with your keys and your change
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.440]   and your sharp knife unfolded."
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.880]   You can stab it like Marquez Brownlee and it won't scratch ever.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.400]   If they make a big enough deal about that, that is a signature issue.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.280]   Look at how much effort they put into design and then nobody ever sees these phones because
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.200]   they have Hello Kitty cases on them or they're scratched up because they're an iPhone 5 and
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.520]   the metal scratches off and they don't look that good in that case either.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   I think that people put cases on their phones partly because of protection but mostly because
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.720]   this is the most personal piece of technology that you want it to look like your phone.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.480]   It's not that you want to protect your phone.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.000]   It's just that you want people to know that you like Hello Kitty or that you couldn't
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.760]   get the pandaba cover when you went to the San Rio store.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.600]   I think that there are a lot of reasons why people like to put cases on their phones.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.400]   I'm saying that Sapphire cover is a great thing if it actually extends the life of the product
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.280]   and it adds a layer of durability.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.920]   Remember that we're doing, we're seeing a video with stress tests on this flexible Sapphire
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.680]   cover but it's still going to have to be bonded to issue the glass with a digitizer and a
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.720]   display and all that sort of stuff and that might not be quite as indestructible as a
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   cover that's on it.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.280]   All I'm saying is that Apple really has to communicate this in terms of real features.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.720]   Instead of saying we've figured out why people put cases on their phones.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.400]   It must be because things get scratched.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   Guess what?
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.800]   Now you never have to cover on the phone again and then a year later people are still putting
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.840]   cases and covers on their phones and Apple is what the hell is wrong with you people?
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.960]   Didn't we tell you you don't have to put a cover in a case on this phone?
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.320]   Yes, but I love the Denver Broncos.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   I'm protected.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   I'm protected.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.320]   One.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.880]   In my primary reason it's just batteries.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.720]   My Mophie case just solves that key issue for me that the phone's too small.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.840]   So anyway, so it doesn't have to have battery.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.880]   But I think that with all of these things, Apple has to.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.360]   This is their livelihood is that they have to constantly be coming out with two or three
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.760]   new technologies with every phone that nobody else can produce at least for the next six
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   months.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.720]   That's the market they've chosen.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.560]   It's not the only market they could have.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.600]   There's a lot of HTC and something, but everybody's always coming up with something.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.720]   The reason that I carry around an HTC M8 is because of the shortcut the field.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.120]   So I can take little pictures for blog posts that look nice with my phone.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.760]   And so that was enough for me to pick that as my Android test phone as opposed to something
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.760]   else.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.920]   And so finding these individual features, I don't think that this is the most important
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920]   feature.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:40.200]   I still think the most important feature that Apple could add to a phone is low light photographic
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   support.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.160]   So that is, and I think for all of them, I know it's a hard thing to cut, but being
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:55.920]   able to get low grain images that are in focus in an average house at night would make more
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.960]   difference to anybody buying any phone anywhere.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.840]   The number one used for a phone is not a phone.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.320]   It's a camera.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   Number one.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.480]   And so this is great, but I really hope that Apple, we see something revolutionary.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.960]   And of course, it's the limit stabilization.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   Right.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.800]   And it's these little things that nudge the whole industry forward.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.040]   I mean, look at what phones were like 10 years ago.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.880]   They were horrible compared to today's phones.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.720]   And today's phones are pretty awesome across the board because everybody's nudging forward.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.160]   Everybody's doing what you're saying, which is trying to get ahead, and especially Apple,
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.800]   trying to get ahead of the competition who tends to copy them.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.520]   And so they have to sort of get ahead if they can.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.760]   Well, it's also important in their own product line because you can't do everything every
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.760]   year.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.080]   You have to, when you can do a graphics boost one year, you can do a pixel boost one year,
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.880]   you can do a camera boost one year.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.000]   It's because technology takes a while to get here.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.360]   So you have to every year find sort of pick your battles and what you can knock out.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.440]   Well, I've got a question I'd like to hear everybody talk about.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.040]   Do you think that we can sort of stop talking about tick and talk releases for phones?
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.480]   Because I don't think that's been Apple.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.320]   I think that Apple's dispensing with that and they're just trying to make the best phone
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.320]   that's practical for any given year.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.320]   All right.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.320]   Go ahead.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.120]   I think I still think I still feel like the S is always like not quite as good as the
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.120]   full release.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.320]   I think that the S is kind of like we have to do something every year.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.600]   I always feel like we get more, we see a bigger change between every major number than we
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.200]   do on the years in between.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.560]   And I don't, I tend to, yeah, I tend to skip the S's.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.160]   I think Apple's under a lot of pressure theoretically to come out with a big push.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   I mean, so much of their revenue, so much of their profits are come from iPhones.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.000]   And if they decide, you know what, let's skip, let's skip a release this year.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.400]   We'll just, we'll just do one next year.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.960]   We won't, we won't have a big release in September.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.560]   We'll just wait until next July or something like that.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:48.880]   It would be, you know, there would be months of speculation about the decline of Apple.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.840]   And you know, there'd be all kinds of angst around with the share.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   Well, they'd fall behind.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.720]   I mean, I think the other thing is, is that you have Samsung releasing, you know, all
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.920]   these phones all the time.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.360]   I mean, technology is changing so fast that doing it every two years will be too slow.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.920]   So I think that adding small features to the S, I mean, you can decide, here's my thing
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.160]   is, I think I don't think you should buy, I used to buy a phone every year, which is
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.440]   a new, new iPhone every year.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.840]   And I've kind of decided I'm just going to buy every other phone.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.480]   So you can decide whether you're on the S track or on the, on the, on the numeral track.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.720]   But I think the bind one every year doesn't make, doesn't make as much sense.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.480]   I'd argue that there isn't a TikTok anymore that Apple is just sort of what I said before
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.760]   that they can't do everything every year.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.760]   So one year you get the case redesign and a few other things like the screen size.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.880]   And then next year, like last year, the, it was an S model, but it had the A7 chip,
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.000]   which I could not, if we had a twice as long podcast, I could not get over how important
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.680]   that, that chipset is and how many things are enabled.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.600]   And we had, you know, new camera technology and we had the new ISP in there.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.800]   There's a touch ID.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.480]   There was, there was a lot of stuff internally and it's not visible.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.000]   Maybe people on the outside don't see it.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.560]   Maybe they just see, oh, this year it comes in gold.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.160]   But I think Apple sort of as big as they are, they're still resource constrained and they
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.440]   need, they need to do, they need to again, pick their battles every year.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.440]   New case design this year, new chipset or some other new technology next year.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.800]   And I think that one of the things that's important is the fact that Apple, I was talking
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.480]   to a manufacturer that makes a lot of the cases specifically.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.640]   And they said the fact that it makes, you get a lot more accessories for the iPhones
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.680]   than you do for a lot of Android phones because it only iterates once a year.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.240]   You know, they said it's really frustrating for an accessory manufacturer to have, you
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.480]   know, the Android market is very, very diverse and it's changing constantly and they're making
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.160]   all these little changes to the same, the same, the same one and it creates a lot of consumer
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.160]   confusion.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.240]   It creates, it's very hard for them to, you know, build, you know, tool everything out
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.960]   for all of these different phones.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.640]   Whereas with an iPhone, it's easy for them.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   They make them for both.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.640]   I mean, they make them for Samsung.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.040]   They said, but by far they sell a lot more because they only have a yearly cycle that
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.440]   they have to make adjustments for.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.120]   And I would say that one of the key features of the iPhone design is the fact that they've
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.240]   gone for this revolutionary thing where it's just a, it's a monolith.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.440]   It's a square, a square right angles, everything.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.400]   And that allows you to do accessories like this.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.480]   They allow you to do accessories like the Aloe Clip.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.800]   That would be so difficult to do if you had really complicated rounded edges to it.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.840]   I really hope that they stick to that because I do think that the, that a phone is really
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.400]   just a frame that delivers the phone features that you then put into whatever thing you want
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.400]   to carry around in.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:29.240]   Of course, the monkey wrench in Apple's desire to stay on top is the most profitable
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.680]   consumer electronics company in history.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.560]   It's China, which, which presents a couple of issues for Apple.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.880]   One of them is a huge opportunity.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.440]   There's so many people who could buy iPhones in China.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.400]   And of course, a huge amount of their growth is going to happen in China.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.920]   And the Chinese handset manufacturers are coming on strong and are already taking their
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.920]   toll on Samsung.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.160]   We, we got the Samsung release and Samsung's already talking about to reduce profitability
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.160]   in the future because of these upstart companies in China producing high quality phones that
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.480]   are very inexpensive.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.200]   So Samsung's being squeezed on the high end by Apple and on the low end by all these Chinese
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.520]   manufacturers and to a certain extent in the middle by the same manufacturer.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.240]   So Apple's really got to own the high end if they don't want to follow Samsung down the
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   whole thing.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.840]   I think we, a lot of us travel, I mean, I travel around the world.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.800]   One of the things is still, no matter what, no matter, there's a lot of people that use
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.760]   different phones, but the, the, the, the cultural icon is still the iPhone.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.520]   You know, like the people who can get one, you know, generally, you know, have one in a
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.960]   lot of these emerging world countries.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.800]   And so I think, but, but part of that is Apple continuing to tell that story and continue
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.720]   and continuing to have that be the thing that they, that they go for the high end.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.200]   Of course, you know, they could go for the entire market, but I think it's just too hard.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.360]   I don't think Apple's built for the low end.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.520]   I don't think they can, they can, they can do that.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.520]   And nor should they.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.520]   Well, let's move on to another story.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.640]   I mean, there was a really interesting story by Daisuke Waka Bayashi and the Wall Street
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   Journal.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   Did you practice that like 10 times?
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.640]   Well, we talked about it in the show earlier today.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   We interviewed, we interviewed guys for this one.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.640]   Oh, so impressed.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   Thank you so much.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   Thank you for pulling the, thank you.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   They were drawing the curtain allowing us to see the wizard behind it.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   Some people like us.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   Some people like the magic.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   I'm sorry, but you know, everybody was thinking it.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.640]   You know it.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.640]   Anyway, so this guy with the hard to pronounce name wrote this article in the Wall Street
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.880]   Journal talking about Tim Cook's version of Apple and sort of addressed the question
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.160]   that I think we've talked about on this show before.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.080]   At least we did when I was a guest on this show a couple of times, which is that is,
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.920]   you know, how different is Apple without Steve Jobs?
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.640]   How different is Apple under Tim Cook?
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.400]   Tim Cook is a completely different person.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.760]   Of course, with Steve Jobs and Tim Cook together in the company for several years, that was
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:42.280]   the dynamic duo of the visionary dictator on one hand and the amazing sort of manufacturing
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.760]   and operations guy on the other hand.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.800]   And now the visionary dictator has been gone for three years.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.520]   He stepped down a CEO three years ago, I think in August and Tim Cook's been running the
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.880]   show by himself.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:29:00.320]   And the company seems to be changing faster as time goes on.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.560]   And so, you know, it was a fascinating article and I wanted to know what you all thought
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.560]   about that.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.960]   Arendelle Richie, what did you think about this article?
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.480]   I mean, is this is he right?
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.680]   Is this really a much kinder, gentler Apple, friendlier to employees, friendlier to the
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.120]   environment, friendlier to shareholders and, you know, just a warmer fuzzier Apple?
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.960]   Well, I think, and I love his writing.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.960]   I'll say that upfront.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.700]   I think that the biggest thing about this article to me is that the mainstream is beginning to
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.360]   get a story that people like you and I and Andy and Alex on the show have been talking
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.560]   about for a year and a half, if not two years already, you know, going back to when Tim Cook
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.640]   reorganized Apple, it was absolutely clear that this was going to be Tim Cook's Apple.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.480]   It was, you know, that he could not have put a bigger, bigger, better flag in the ground
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.480]   for that.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.520]   And I think everything that's followed since then shows, you know, sort of the direction
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.400]   that he's going with Apple.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.680]   I'm happy that the mainstream media is recognizing this now.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.120]   I'm not sure if two years is a good amount of time or if it should have been earlier,
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.520]   or, you know, thankfully it's not later.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.400]   But the biggest thing I drew from this was just I thought his comments about the board
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.480]   of directors was apt because given what Tim Cook has done with the management team and
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.680]   given what he's done with events like WWDC and how he's managing things internally, the
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   board of directors is sort of like the last big institution in Apple that doesn't have
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.280]   his fingerprints on it.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   Right.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.280]   He wants to expand the board, right?
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.000]   And the people who are currently on the board have been, you know, most of them have been
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.840]   sort of hanging onto the chair that they sit on for many years.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   For over a decade, yeah.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.160]   And it's essentially their Steve Jobs loyalists, Steve Jobs loyalists.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.720]   And so, you know, the idea is to sort of expand that.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.160]   One of the things that, sorry, one of the things I feel interesting about that is that
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.440]   it was a board that Steve Jobs needs.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:51.080]   And as much as all these articles keep saying, "Tim Cook has no Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.560]   did exactly what Tim Cook is doing.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.240]   Steve Jobs was not good at logistics and he was not good at supply chain.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.920]   He was not good at operations.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.200]   That's why he got Tim Cook.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.000]   And Tim Cook has singular skills.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.920]   And that's why he's getting the people he's getting because he wants them to compliment
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.560]   him the same way he complimented the skills that were at Apple.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.600]   So that to me is 100% normal.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:15.480]   And I think it definitely, just as it says in the article, it definitely illustrates the
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.720]   whole revolutionary versus leader.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.880]   I mean, someone who's going to lead the revolution, someone's going to lead the country is two
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880]   different people.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   And I think that Apple could not have gotten to where it is without Steve Jobs pushing that
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.160]   envelope.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.360]   But to continue to grow and be the company it is, I think that Cook is perfect for that
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   as far as building that out.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.320]   Because I think most of us have heard of the stories of Steve.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.320]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.600]   And so he's a pretty intense guy.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.560]   He quotes a former employee saying that, "Steve was a wartime CEO while Tim is a peacetime
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.560]   CEO."
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   But I'm not sure that Apple is no longer at war.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.000]   I think that they're facing all kinds of challenges.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.600]   And one of the benefits of one of the reasons Apple came from the brink and rose to become
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:04.040]   the most profitable consumer electronics company ever is that Steve Jobs was a visionary.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:09.640]   And he was a singular kind of personality within the company who could just dictate things.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.040]   Nobody can dictate things anymore.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.920]   Now they talk, the article talks about Tim Cook as a consensus builder and everybody
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   likes that.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.480]   That sounds like a great thing.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.320]   But if you talk to anybody who's tried to do something really, really hard like create
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:29.440]   a consumer electronics device, you know, hawkins who created the original Palm Pilot, they
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.240]   will tell you, "You need somebody to just crack the whip and say no, it's going to be
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   like this.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.640]   We don't care how many engineers think we should have 10 more buttons, there's going
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.560]   to be four buttons, period.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.360]   You need somebody to say that kind of thing."
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.000]   And you know, this is the question.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.200]   Is Apple the kind of company that can move forward and compete?
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   But I think part of that was an acknowledgement that there isn't going to be another replacement.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.480]   It's not going to be that way.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.840]   Whether we want it to be or not, I mean, obviously we didn't choose to not have Steve there.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.960]   So the main thing is that it is, you know, you're going to have to find that.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.240]   And if you don't have that singular person that people are going to follow, you're going
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.280]   to have to find another solution.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.160]   And it seems to me that Apple is changing much quicker more recently.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.800]   So the two big things that Apple has done recently that I think are super uncharacteristic
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.760]   of the company, the first one, of course, is the acquisition of Beats Electronics, which
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.920]   I don't, you know, this is something that would be unimaginable, I think, a couple of
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.440]   years ago, at least for me.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.920]   And the second one was the pride video that was released yesterday.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:31.400]   Of course, Apple had a big presence at San Francisco's Gay Pride Parade.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.680]   And yesterday, there was videos of heavily produced, very, you know, emotional kind of
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.480]   video of the kind you'd expect from Apple.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.360]   But those people in the video are Apple employees.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:47.000]   When have you seen Apple employees like being presented as like, get to know us, we are
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.400]   these warm and fuzzy people.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:54.040]   We are, you know, people, you know, this is a very unappled thing to do.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:59.840]   And but the thing is Apple has to, I mean, they have to show up for these kind of cultural
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.520]   things because otherwise, you know, they're also competing not just for consumer electronics,
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.200]   but they're also competing for employees, you know, with Facebook, with Google, both
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:13.520]   who had large presences and many of the pride, you know, parades.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.600]   So you know, and they don't want to be seen as non progressive, you know, you know, as,
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.560]   you know, because that affects the people that they're looking for.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:21.560]   It's going to affect that.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.720]   And so I think that, and I think that he did it from a genuine perspective, but those
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.440]   are the kind of things that Apple that I think that Steve didn't think that was necessary.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440]   Right.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.920]   You know, for them to do and that he understands now that they don't have, when you don't
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.360]   have someone that everyone just wants to go work for, you do have to think about all
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.200]   these other bits and pieces.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   Absolutely.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.480]   And of course, you know, there's the environmental aspect.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.600]   I mean, Apple has been criticized heavily by environmental groups for many years for their
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   environmental record.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:57.240]   And again, the message seemed to be a few years ago from the Steve Jobs version of Apple.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.040]   Look, you know, we're, you know, okay on in the environment, but you know, the important
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.280]   thing is we make these great products and that's how we help everybody.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.480]   We make fantastic devices.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.000]   Nowadays, Apple seems to be really pushing to become much more environmentally friendly.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.480]   This was addressed in the article that we're talking about.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.320]   In fact, yesterday, I think we learned that they are investing 55 million in a new 100
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:24.400]   acre, 17.5 megawatt solar farm to have cleaner energy for, for one of their data centers.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   I think I think both Apple and Google are competing to be the first company that is
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.400]   off the grid.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.760]   But, you know, just say like we're off the grid, we're completely renewable resource.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.760]   Self-sufficient.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.360]   I think that I because both of them are investing heavily in that a lot of other companies
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   are too.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.920]   But I think that they're because I think someone wants that that notch of saying that we're
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.520]   doing long bushy beards and now we're designing our own flags.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.240]   Yes, piling weapons.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   Exactly.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   That's right.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.240]   And plain that's a master light.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.560]   It's not just that they're worried that the entire energy infrastructure in the United
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   States is completely broken.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.640]   But this spaceship campus would be a great place for the zombie apocalypse.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.080]   There's underground bunkers.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.280]   There's all kinds of things you can do.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   So that's where I'm going.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.720]   Well, I think the thing is you can shut all the outside doors from World War Z and you
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   just be inside.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   Right.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   And you just be inside.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   Hopefully they'll use sapphires, the glass, around the outside.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   That would be absolutely fantastic.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.280]   Like, Wally, it can go into orbit.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.280]   Right.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   Exactly.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   That's right.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.280]   We're going to find out.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.000]   So one other point in this article that I thought was kind of interesting is that he
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.980]   pointed out as one of the, you know, on his list of reasons why Tim Cook is a warm and
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.420]   fuzzy person is that he's more willing to share attention.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:30.300]   So one example of that, of course, is that he hired, you know, he essentially was a kind
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.360]   of aqua hire of Beselectronics.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.200]   And so now we've got these towering personalities from music industry who are now executives at
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.840]   Apple at least ostensibly, Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   But the other one is that he pointed out that at the most recent developer conference,
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:48.560]   he allowed Craig Federighi to dominate the stage.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:53.340]   And I wonder how much of that is Cook sharing the attention and how much of that is Federighi
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.580]   being groomed to be a successor.
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.420]   Is that a possibility there?
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.420]   What do you think about that?
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.020]   I don't really think so.
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.500]   Tim Cook is a young person.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.620]   He's got a lot of time in that seat if he wants to stay there.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.260]   He certainly has the success that will mean that he's not going to be leveraged out of
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.820]   that seat if he doesn't want to leave it.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.060]   I think it's mostly because I think that there's, he's smart enough to have learned the lesson
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:20.840]   of some of the bad things about having such an iconoclastic figure as the CEO.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:26.040]   Anytime we talk about any of these articles, I talk about the post Steve Jobs era of Apple,
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.680]   which has been going on for at least three years now.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.720]   Maybe the mainstream press should not worry so much about this anymore.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.960]   Maybe this is an old issue.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.160]   As much as I'd like to talk about that sort of stuff, I also have to acknowledge that
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:45.300]   this is a problem of Apple's own making because if the public and if the mainstream press
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:51.000]   have been taught that Apple was Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs was the visionary that led to
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.440]   every single thing that happened correctly and nothing good would have come out of Apple
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:01.160]   if not for Steve Jobs personally having hands on hip deep waiting into every single project,
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:06.320]   that's the message that they were sending correctly or correctly, correctly incorrectly
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.440]   by having him front and center with every single one of these presentations.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:16.120]   Remember that during later Apple Steve notes, we would actually sort of count the amount
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.480]   of stage time that Steve would get and we'd be concerned when he started handing things
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.840]   off to other people and we started, is his his health taking another turn now?
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.080]   Why is he not talking about this wonderful feature about editing photos right now?
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.440]   So I think that Tim, I'm guessing that Tim or at least the people who are in charge of
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.800]   Apple are at least smart enough now to know that they should not let that happen again
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.280]   because if they allow the public and investors and the other parts of the community to think
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.880]   that Apple computer is all about Tim Cook and Tim Cook's vision, that makes it that much
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.360]   harder for the next CEO whenever he or she comes to fill those shoes again.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.800]   They want to create the impression that Apple is a large vibrant company full of lots and
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:02.280]   lots of people, most of whom you will never hear of or see on a stage but it's part of
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:07.360]   the stew that makes Apple work is each one of these tens of thousands of people or 10
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.880]   or 15,000 people that contribute to every single product that they make.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.400]   My understanding is that it's actually quite simple.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.360]   I don't know if this is 100% correct but it's actually quite simple.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.280]   They want the best person on the stage for every segment and often that would have been
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.320]   Steve Jobs because you have Steve Jobs, you're disposal, you'd be crazy not to you.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:27.440]   He is the master presenters, master presenter and now you have sort of roles and Tim Cook
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.680]   has taken the role.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:29.920]   He's not the, it just works guy.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.600]   He's not the one more thing guy.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.400]   He's the, this is what we believe.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.480]   He's Apple's core values and he comes up at the beginning and the middle and the end
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.560]   and he states why Apple is doing what he's doing and then he, why he's doing what it's
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.680]   doing and then he hands off to someone like Craig Federica who's going to talk about
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.600]   the technology or even Chris Latner is going to talk about Swift and they really want to
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:54.680]   make it about the show and not one personality because there is no longer that one personality.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.160]   And I wouldn't be surprised if they're not constantly rotating these, like who the people
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.960]   are that lead one of these keynotes.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.320]   I would be surprised if, I was just, I think they're going to constantly rotate because
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.480]   I think that this happens in every company.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:12.640]   We do a lot of streams for a lot of corporate big corporations and you do end up with this
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:17.280]   thing where suddenly the CEO is not showing up as much or the CMO or someone else and
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.000]   suddenly everything's wrong.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.040]   And it's not, and it also, it's not just that everyone thinks there's something wrong
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:26.720]   but it actually throws off the entire pace of the event by having somebody there for
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.240]   three or four years and then disappearing.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.280]   And so I think that constantly churning this and building up lots of personalities to do
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.760]   that, I think makes a lot of sense.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.440]   Frank, if you look at the Surface 3 event or you look at some of the Samsung events,
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.120]   they do not have a, at least they're not presenting their best foot forward with the people presenting
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:46.560]   this stuff on stage and Apple's lucky that if you have a Federica or a Shiller, you want
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.760]   them up there because they make a great showcase for your product.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.080]   Well in Just a Sec, we're going to talk about the upcoming IWatch.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:57.560]   I know you guys are sick to death of this topic but there's a new wrinkle in the whole development
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.960]   and the whole criminology of the IWatch that I'd like to talk about very briefly but first
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.600]   we're going to take a break and talk about one of our sponsors which of course is audible.com.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.680]   I've been an audible user.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.840]   I like to say that I think I've been an audible user longer than Leo.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.320]   I think I've been an audible user since about 2000.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.760]   Back in those days it was that physical device that you bought where the service was actually
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   incidental that came with the device but in any event I love audible.com because it enables
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.040]   me to read books that I would never have the time to read otherwise.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:32.840]   I do a lot of hiking and trail running and driving and just walking around, housework,
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.480]   dishes, whatever and it enables me, if I'm not listening to podcasts or netcasts, I'm
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.800]   listening to books and I've read many, many books that are just so wonderful because the
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.520]   actors who read them are make you really bring them to life.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:51.080]   Audible has more than 150,000 downloadable books.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.840]   These include all kinds of things like literature, fiction, nonfiction, periodicals, you name
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   it.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.040]   Audible.com is absolutely awesome and I was reading about this book earlier today I think
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.560]   in the times.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.920]   It's a book called I Said Yes to Everything.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.040]   It's a brand new book by Lee Grant.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.640]   Now Lee Grant is an Academy Award winning actress who was on the Blacklist, the Hollywood
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.400]   Blacklist for 12 years.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.520]   She was in Valley of the Dolls and Shampoo.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:21.760]   She had quite a kind of a crazy life during a crazy time and she wrote this book that
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.080]   is all about it and you can listen to this.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.680]   This can be one of your free books so you get two free books when you sign up for Audible
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.160]   and I'm looking forward to this particular book.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.480]   Of course I've been a member for a long time.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.480]   I don't get it free.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.720]   It's part of my membership and I'm looking forward to listening to this particular book.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:43.240]   Now if you want to download this audiobook or any other audiobook for free, if you're
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.000]   not a member and you want to sign up, go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.880]   That's audible.com/macbreak and again there's nothing else out there like Audible.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.320]   This is a fantastic place for you to listen to some of the greatest books ever.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.440]   I personally, sometimes I'm a little ashamed and then I think, you know what, I'm going
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.440]   to own it.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.560]   I like to listen to classics that have been around for ages and sometimes they have
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:14.000]   revised or unabridged editions that are just a joy to listen to including books that I've
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.600]   already read in print long ago.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:21.800]   It's just fantastic to do that and I actually love to do that and Audible has a huge number
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.080]   of classics and older books, not just brand new bestsellers.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.640]   So you want to check out audible.com and even if you're just on the fence or just thinking
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.720]   about it, just go to the site, browse through their collection and listen to some of the
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.000]   samples and I think you're going to be super impressed by what's possible with an audible.com
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.400]   subscription.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:46.640]   So sign up for audible.com that's audible.com/macbreak.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.480]   I get along with people a lot better because of Audible.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.880]   Yeah, because you're not listening to them.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.880]   Well, I'm listening to the book.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.880]   Right?
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.880]   And so there's no more in your patient with them.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.560]   You know, because I'll be at the airport and it's like you're just sitting there and
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.400]   normally you would just be like, I cannot believe I'm waiting another hour for whatever,
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.040]   but instead I'm listening to, you know, something.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.520]   When I make another confession, I'm a writer and whenever I hear, we're all writers.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:14.280]   Whenever I hear something that's badly spoken, I'm always afraid it's going to screw up my
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.280]   writing somehow.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.400]   Like I have this almost superstition about it.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.200]   And so that's one of the reasons I like Audible.com because, you know, I think it's going to improve
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.600]   my writing if I listen to a Shakespeare trained actor reading about, you know, reading some
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.320]   business book or something like that, which, you know.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.760]   And so I want a really good voice in my head.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:36.560]   I don't want some some hack unless, of course, they're the author in which case it's okay.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.040]   Well, let's talk about the I watch.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.480]   So I've been I've been wearing this bad boy since Google I/O.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.280]   This is the this is the LG Gwatch or the watch.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.920]   As Jason Howell calls it.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.920]   How do you like it?
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   I love it.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.480]   I love it for two reasons.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:56.920]   First of all, I love it because notifications on the wrist is a life changing wonder.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:00.800]   That simple fact is just you really get it when you use it.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.240]   Remember the when the iPad came out and everybody's like, Oh, I don't really get it.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.240]   And then when they tried it, they're like, Oh, I get it.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240]   I get it now.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.560]   They it's one of those things that you have to experience to really understand.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.160]   And this notifications on your wrist, of course, just talking about notifications, not all
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.880]   the other incredible things you can do when apps are brought into the picture.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.600]   So that's one reason notifications should live on the wrist.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   Which was kind of funny because it's the one thing I don't want.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.280]   Like I don't even like notifications on my computer.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.120]   I don't like to be interrupted.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:32.360]   So the number one thing I was worried about was like, Oh, I can turn the notifications
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   on.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.600]   There's a lot of things I'm just two different two different views.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.080]   There's a lot of things I'm super excited about with with a watch.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.600]   But it's just funny that well, I'm a good I'm a Google fan.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.000]   So I use I use Google calendar.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.680]   I use lots of Google stuff.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.920]   And I miss things because with Google, you know, you don't know my calendars.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.120]   Yeah, if you kind of a lot of meetings.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:54.160]   So so if if Google isn't actually open and a tab on your browser, you won't get a notification
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.000]   on your desktop if you're just doing the vanilla like sort of cloud version of Google calendar,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   for example.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.400]   So, you know, one right off the bat, you miss nothing like you get everything on your watch.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.720]   And you can just glance and go, I don't have to worry about that right now.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.520]   And it's, you know, that you spent a third of a second on a process that used to take
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:17.280]   a couple of seconds sounds like nothing, but it actually adds up to feeling, you know,
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.080]   to something that's really effective.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.080]   But the other thing that's fantastic about this is having Google now on the wrist.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.120]   Now Google now is a great service.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.280]   I know that we talk about a lot in comparison with Siri.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.560]   But of course, what Google now has that Siri does not is a lot more preemptive notifications
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.280]   that sort of, you know, it rummages through your Gmail and says, Oh, you know, I see you
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.280]   have a flight coming up and then says, Oh, you know, better get to the airport because
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.280]   the traffic is bad.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.280]   So you have to leave right now a little weird little things like that.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:50.440]   There's a new report coming out today out of boy genius report talking, for example,
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.320]   about how you'll be able to control your all of your media, no matter where it is through
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.880]   Google now, you just talk to it and say, you know, pause or whatever.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.560]   And that kind of functionality, the wrist is the right place for something like Google
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.560]   now.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.680]   It's going to be an incredible place for Siri and long battery life.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:08.520]   I mean, part of the reason that I can't have something that's constantly connected is that
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.520]   I'm constantly charging my, my phone.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.400]   You know, and so my, you know, and just maybe I'm the only one that has this problem, but
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.680]   I feel like, you know, an iPhone lasts about half a day.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.880]   And so I'm constantly trying to figure out where I'm going to plug it in.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.880]   So I don't always have my phone, you know, with me.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.920]   Well, the down, the bad news is that now you have to constantly charge your phone and
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   your watch.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   So now, well, just a question.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.760]   But I think that a lot of them are talking about one week, you know, or three or four
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.120]   days of usage between charges.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.960]   And I think that's the, I think that's part of the key.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.000]   This thing is a day, but that's not the wrinkle that I referenced earlier.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.680]   The wrinkle is that Apple has poached as they say a, an executive from a Swiss watch manufacturer,
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.400]   Mag Hoyer, his name is Patrick Prunio.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.000]   I think I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   You're in Montreal.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   Renee Ritchie.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.240]   Is that, am I pronouncing that correctly?
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.440]   Cineo, I think.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.440]   Okay.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.440]   Let's go with your pronunciation.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.280]   That sounded a lot better.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.440]   And what's interesting to me about this is this isn't, they're not hiring a genius designer
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.560]   engineer who knows how to design watches.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.840]   They're hiring somebody whose specialty is selling watches in the luxury marketplace,
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:17.040]   not selling watches through Best Buy, not selling watches to gadget freaks.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.320]   I don't know if they make any watches that cause less than like $2,000.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.480]   You know, I mean, I think that that, I mean, that, that watch company, I think everything
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.480]   is.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   But what does this hire say about Apple's intentions, if anything?
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.480]   Definitely.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.880]   Definitely looking at bargains.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.280]   Yeah, it really does change by thinking.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.400]   I mean, we've talked about the perspective, Apple wearable so long that just during the
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.800]   show, I've come up with an idea that I really want to write a column that's just simply
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.440]   the anti-annout go talks about Apple wearables bingo card.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.240]   All the squares that I will definitely hit and if we have tight long enough about it.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.720]   And I vote, and one of the squares in the card is that I don't see them making, I don't,
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.280]   I was, I would suspect they're making something closer to an affordable fitness band than an
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.920]   expensive premium watch.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:05.200]   But this hire really kind of upsets that because, as you said, these are not, they didn't buy,
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.040]   they didn't hire some guy off a swatch.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:13.000]   They didn't hire some guy whose job is to import millions and millions of cheap Chinese
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.240]   watches and put NFL logos on them.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.920]   They did get someone who knows how to appeal to people who are willing to spend hundreds,
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.200]   if not thousands of dollars on watches.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:27.920]   The only thing that sort of tempers my confusion about this is that this is a recent hire and
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:33.480]   maybe this is, they're bringing them on board for phase two of watch production as opposed
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.800]   to whatever they're planning to announce later this year, if anything.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.600]   But yeah, it is a significant wrinkle and that makes you sit back.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.800]   If you don't smoke a pipe, go out and buy a pipe and some pipe tobacco so you can lean
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   back.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.720]   If you don't have a beard, grow a beard so you can puff on the pipe while you stroke
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.360]   the beard and think about what this means for Apple wearables.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.800]   I'm going to do all that immediately after the show is over.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.920]   To Andy's point, I mean, when Apple doesn't release products, like they were, the iPhone
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.960]   was not a product, it was a product line, the iPad was a product line.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.320]   They released the first version, the original iPhone, the original iPad, but they were working
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.240]   towards the air, they were working towards the iPhone 5.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.560]   And I think a lot of what we'll see with the watch is similar, why there's all these
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.280]   different hires.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.720]   The iPod was the original wearable, it just doesn't run iOS, it's not connected, it can't
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.440]   do anything in a modern internet of things environment and whatever Apple's working on
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:25.000]   for wearables is going to exist in that environment.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.440]   If there is a range of products within a few years, I would not be at all surprised
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:33.640]   in what I'd be surprised if they run the gamut from a really high end Mac Pro, top of the
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:39.120]   line iPhone 5S style device down to more reasonable things, maybe not an iPod shuffle
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.680]   sort of a reasonable thing, but something absolutely more accessible.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:51.440]   And of course, this hire comes as the latest in a series, the hire Burberry CEO Angela Rents.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.120]   Some time ago, the former head of French fashion brand, I've sent Saint Laurent, I'm
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.120]   saying that right.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.120]   I don't know.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   He's saying it off.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.120]   Thank you.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.440]   I watch the project runway, that's the only reason why I know how to say that.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.160]   Okay, thank you.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.680]   His name is Paul Denif.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.720]   And so, you know, they're going high end on all of these hires and it all seems to be
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.880]   around the fact that, you know, Apple's approaching this like this is not a gadget,
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.200]   this is fashion.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.840]   And I think a larger question is, is it all, are they hiring all these people just for
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:27.080]   that or are they hiring them because this is the direction Apple's going is wearable,
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.640]   fashionable electronics, you know, is like beats.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.640]   Like beats.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.640]   Like beats.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.640]   Really?
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:34.640]   I mean, that's it.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.120]   So, I mean, and so I think that that is that entire process, maybe, you know, expanding
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.200]   the Apple universe into a lot of things.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.600]   I think that Apple has a lot of people that would buy a lot of things from them, you know,
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.200]   whether we agree that they should or not or whether that makes sense or not.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.360]   But I mean, if Apple made appliances, I would buy, I'd buy an Apple for a drater and a microwave
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   and so on.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   I would.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:58.800]   And I'd pay 50% more for it because, you know, but the French would be so thin you could
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.040]   not buy milk and balance.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.040]   It possibly would.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   You have to buy them in points now.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.040]   Yes.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.040]   You'd finally go metric on the heels of Apple.
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:10.680]   But I think that there's, I think that when you, when you look at how do you take a, a
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.400]   one of the largest companies in the world to continue to grow, I do think Apple is going
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.560]   to have to move outside of iPhones and iPads and computers.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:22.120]   They're going to have to start looking at all these, do the same thing, you know, carefully,
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:26.200]   hopefully, but, you know, the same thing that Samsung does and Sony does and everything
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:30.040]   else is which is that there's a wide variety of things that you can buy from them.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   I think they'll do it slowly, but I think bringing all these people in, I think they're
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:38.560]   basically getting the mind share of some of the best marketers when it comes to upscale
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:47.040]   marketing, their point, they're buying basically hiring everyone that knows how to do this
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.040]   well.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.360]   And that was the interesting thing about that article we talked about earlier and Gruber
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:54.040]   pointed this out is that for years we've been hearing that Tim Cook hasn't done anything.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.400]   He's not moving fast enough.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.840]   There's no new products.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.480]   And then immediately now there's, he's spreading the company too thin.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:04.160]   He's putting Apple into too many businesses, which is something you don't hear about Google
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.400]   or, you know, who wants to get into everybody's business.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   But the minute there might be even one new product.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.480]   And he's like, "No, no, no, slow down Tim Cook."
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:17.000]   There's also an element to the acquisition of Beats Electronics that I think has been
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.360]   radically under emphasized, which is the fact that Jimmy Iovine is really, really into,
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:29.200]   and of course Beats Music, the music service that that company has, has been intending
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:34.520]   to bring about this world of what they call 360 deals, to implement 360 deals.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:38.400]   360 deals being, instead of trying to sell music and make money for music, which you'd
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.920]   have to be crazy to try to do that these days, you can't make money for music, is to
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.000]   take music and sell other things like headphones, for example.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.960]   And if you look at, in detail, at the marketing approach that Beats Electronics has taken,
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.720]   you know, there's the Lady Gaga earbuds and the, you know, and that's really how they're
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.320]   going at this whole thing.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:05.360]   You're selling consumer electronics through content, through brand, through celebrity,
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.960]   through, you know, association with other things.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:13.000]   And I just can't help but think that, you know, all of these hires, you know, like you
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.720]   say, it's not necessarily about smartwatches.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:24.400]   It could be about a new generation of marketing where you use sort of the branding attributes
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:29.680]   to sell consumer electronics in the same way that Beats has done with their headphones.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.440]   And to a certain extent, the way that Apple has sold, you know, iPhones, I mean, if you
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.080]   look at going to Apple Store, the whole experience, it's not just like, oh, here, we're just
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.680]   selling these goods because they're high quality merchandise.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.720]   No, it's all about being part of this aspirational.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.400]   And it's exactly what it is.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:51.040]   And so they could be just intending to really turn up the...
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.480]   And again, focusing on this, I think that Apple is...
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   I think if we ever...
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:58.000]   When we look at these hires, I think if we ever thought that Apple is going to go for
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.600]   the low end of the market, I think that that is probably over.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:07.640]   I mean, I think that Apple is definitely knows where they succeeded and they're going to
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.720]   continue to move down that path and own that part of the market.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.400]   I don't think that they're...
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:16.720]   But I think that, you know, I do think we're going to eventually see 24-bit, you know,
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.520]   because that sells stuff, you know, and especially if you move to a lightning connector and
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:25.320]   you have a lot of other data that you can use your headphones with.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.320]   I think that, you know, I think those are the kind of things that...
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:32.800]   And before we think that 24-bit is important, we just look at the Kickstarter that, you
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   know, for the...
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   What is it?
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.800]   Is it the Pwn?
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:36.800]   So the...
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   Anyway, the...
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   Pwn-o-player.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   Pwn-o-player.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.640]   Yeah, the...
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.680]   There are a lot of...
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.600]   There's enough people interested in that, you know, that want the...
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.080]   Whatever that is, you know, the extra.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.240]   You know, they want... and some of it's completely ego-driven.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.280]   And some of it is actually useful.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.280]   And I just...
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.280]   Please.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.280]   Go ahead.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.280]   We...
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:01.600]   One of the enduring maxims about Apple is that their most important product has never
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.400]   been an iPad or an iPhone or a Mac.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.680]   It's always been Apple itself.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:10.280]   And I think that it's interesting to think about what Apple thinks that they have to
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:13.160]   do in order to get to the next level of their existence.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.880]   Because there's so few tech companies that last 10 years, let alone 20.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.960]   And now they really are...
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.440]   I think their eyes are on the prize of just being one of those brands that always exists.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.040]   And I think part of that strategy has to be to not keep...
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:32.080]   Not continue to attach their success or failure to specific products or specific product
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   lines would make...
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:37.760]   But to make sure that that logo indicates a philosophy of design and construction that
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.000]   people are always going to get behind.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.640]   I think that as much as we laugh about Sony's mistakes, there are a company that's been
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.560]   around since the mid-50s.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:49.440]   And the reason why they're still a recognizable brand is because that they are now...
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:53.280]   They make cameras, they're into movie production, they're into music production, anything that
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.600]   is related to everything that has to do with entertainment or branding, they've got their
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.400]   logo on their somewhere.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.400]   I would hate to...
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:07.640]   But I would hate to think that Apple wants to become an Omega watch brand or like one
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:12.000]   of these high premium brands that make really cool stuff that you don't know anybody who
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.960]   owns one because who for God's sake is going to spend a thousand dollars on a wristwatch.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.160]   There are people that are out there who will do that.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.120]   There's a lot of money to be made there.
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:24.920]   But I think that part of Apple's pride is in being on the subway, riding part to and
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.720]   from work and seeing so many people using iPhones and iPad minis.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:32.640]   You also see the companies that Apple has been traditionally associated with.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   And Sony is...
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.560]   One of them, the other is Nike.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:41.720]   Nike being a company that thrives in an industry where they just keep churning out new designs
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:51.880]   and you have to keep that BS, if you will, just essentially the image of the company is
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:56.720]   what's driving up the margins and that's the business they want to be in, the high margin
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:57.720]   business.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.120]   Nike is a great example because there are so many...
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.160]   Nike actually often does ads that don't even promote any products.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:09.960]   It's just here's the logo, here's music, here's music behind the logo, enjoy the swoosh, enjoy
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.960]   the logo.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:15.600]   I'm not sure if Apple would ever become so empty that they would do, "Hey, look at our
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:21.360]   logo, the rotating in 40 space, enjoy it with your new 3D perspective glasses."
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:25.120]   But I think that that's the sort of place where they would need to go if they want the
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:27.640]   ability to launch products based on their logo.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:34.840]   Again, it's not just hype, although as a side, the second time I wanted to bring that up,
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:40.400]   interesting that a lot of us have been to China, have been to the counterfeit market and you
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:45.400]   see the Apple logo on so many things, even flip phones that have nothing to do.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:49.840]   You think that you're going to see nothing but iPhone clones, but no, you just see people
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:55.320]   just want to have a back illuminated Apple logo on whatever phone they're going to use.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.040]   And that's the sort of strength that I think that Apple...
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:00.840]   I don't think Apple is proud of the fact that people might care about the logo and not care
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:04.880]   about the engineering of the design, but they definitely want people to associate that logo
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.240]   with whatever it is we're about to show you, be prepared for it to be very new, very exciting,
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:14.520]   very well designed, very well made, and as importantly as any of those other things,
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:18.440]   a product that we, Apple, absolutely stand behind and believe in.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:23.120]   It's not just China, it was at the farmers market locally here over the weekend and there
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:29.360]   was a guy making handmade cutting boards in the shape of the Apple logo.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:34.520]   And by the way, the iPad makes a great cutting board as well, it doesn't scratch.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.520]   Does that first thing happen?
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.520]   The Sapphire one's going to be great?
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.880]   Oh, it's going to be fantastic, you can't wait.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:43.200]   I was like, as we look at the quote unquote "internet of things," the opportunities for
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:48.800]   Apple to expand their current leadership into those markets is pretty endless.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.880]   And I think that at first they're, of course, empowering everybody else to do it, but I think
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:59.280]   that I expect to see them adding more and more and more things to what they're providing.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   Yeah, and the internet of things and the whole wearables mark my words, it's going to be
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.480]   flooded with junk.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.120]   The smart watches this time next year or two years from now, there's going to be a thousand
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:16.160]   different smart watches you're going to buy, they'll average $50 each and Apple has to
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   rise above that.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.720]   They can't just get in there and just be another device.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.720]   They have to have the highest.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.560]   Let's point out the same things about it.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.720]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.720]   I'll speak after you.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.280]   I was just going to say that's the interesting thing about Android Wear is it seems that
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.080]   it's not like Android open source project that Google has taken much tighter control
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.120]   so that it'll be much harder to flood the market with cheap Android Wear devices.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.440]   Maybe you'll get cheap Android devices, but the premium experience I think they're trying
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.880]   to protect that more than they did with Android on the phone.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:49.360]   I think they could even be taking the influence by Apple in that regard because it's not just
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:54.600]   Android Wear, it's Android Auto, the Android TV product.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   Those are all locked down.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.080]   You can't put a custom interface on it.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.280]   It's stuff like you could on Android.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:04.360]   I have the feeling that, and also the Android One initiative for emerging markets, that's
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.680]   apparently also locked down.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.680]   I think that Google has learned that they know better than the Samsungs of the world
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.440]   and really want to push a uniform user interface.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.520]   The cheap ones will be really terrible now.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.520]   That's right.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.160]   They'll be really terrible.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.880]   Let's remember everything that the Android market did to improve phones and to improve
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.880]   tablets.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.960]   Apple said that, "Well, the reason why we made this 9.7 inches is because to make it
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.960]   smaller is stupid.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.600]   People say that you want a smaller tablet, you're wrong."
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.880]   Then Samsung, all these other companies said, "Well, why don't we just, we've got some
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.880]   extra cash.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.920]   Why don't we just put some smaller tablets on the market?"
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920]   What do you know?
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.760]   People actually do like smaller tablets, so long as it's not running Android 2.3.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.760]   Same thing with larger phones and different experiments with different form factors and
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.760]   different displays.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.960]   I'm actually looking forward to the legendary 50 smartwatches that might come out next
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.960]   year because 47 of them will be utter crap and will be sold blister pack for $10 at
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.240]   CVS pharmacy.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:10.600]   But three of them will be, well, tell you what, instead of the $500 rose gold Apple Smartwatch
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:16.800]   that does a million things, here is a $99 watch with an monochromatic LCD display that does
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:21.120]   nothing but receives notifications from your Android or iOS watch.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.880]   It does that one thing extremely well, but it doesn't do much beyond that.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.600]   But guess what, it's $99 and you don't have $1,000 to spend on a watch that you don't
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.880]   know if you're going to like.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.400]   That might be the reason why iteration number three or four of the Apple Smartwatches, "Hey,
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.400]   guess what?
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:41.560]   We're making a $149 three-color smartwatch that doesn't do everything that the $1,000
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.240]   does, but you're welcome."
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.720]   It's a really good point.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.080]   Yeah, it's going to be a crazy market.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.760]   Number one, Steve Jobs said that nobody reads anymore and that, of course, they started
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:02.440]   reading again when the iPad came out and had this great reading system and so on.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.440]   So a lot of that is fun.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.000]   A lot of that is just Apple's attitude.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   So very interesting.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.200]   Well, it looks like iPhones may soon be built primarily by robots.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:17.040]   There's a chief executive of Foxconn's parent, Hanhai, his name is Terry Gao, said at a shareholders
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.120]   meeting recently that the company is going to deploy 10,000 assembly line robots, mostly
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.600]   for iPhone, they're going to be used for other devices as well.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:31.000]   And the machines cost $25,000 each and each one of them can build 30,000 devices a year.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.080]   I don't know how legit these numbers are or how real this information is, but clearly
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:42.440]   Foxconn said three years ago they wanted a million robots installed by 2014, which all
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:49.440]   raises the question, how does a radical robot deployment in the manufacturing process for
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.840]   Apple devices and other consumer electronics affect the whole manufacturing system that
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.440]   do you need to be in China, for example, if you're using robots?
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.440]   Do you need all these new robots?
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.440]   Any of the American robots.
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.440]   Right, American robots.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:09.200]   I mean, is it, or do you, are you going to need a hundred thousand robot engineers, which
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.920]   is something the United States probably couldn't produce very quickly?
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.920]   Why not?
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.920]   Does this change manufacturing?
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.640]   I don't know if we know exactly how many people Foxconn employs, but I doubt that if we
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.280]   look at typically with a lot of these robot systems, I doubt that they're replacing everybody.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.600]   So it's not a clean system.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.760]   So I still think that there's tens of thousands of people that will be working there and supporting
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.520]   these robots doing all the things that they're doing.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.400]   It definitely will decrease the overhead.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:42.040]   I think that we may see the delta change between the cost of the cost differentials of what
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.840]   it would be in the US and versus China.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.880]   I think that there's a lot of reasons for Apple to move a robotic system back to the US someday
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.080]   because I think they wouldn't have so many rumors.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.360]   So I think that there would be some advantages there.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.520]   But I do think this is something, this is a good wake up call for people who are constantly
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.480]   worried about the outsourcing of jobs that eventually, if you're doing a low level job,
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.560]   eventually you're going to be replaced by a robot anyway.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:12.120]   So from a larger job market thing, this is why we need to be looking at upscale job.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.400]   How do we train people for upscale jobs and not manufacturing jobs?
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.960]   Because eventually, and I used to work in a manufacturing, electronic manufacturing,
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:25.800]   and I watched robots slowly replace large chunks of our factory.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.800]   It's going to be interesting.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:32.000]   And of course, the dynamics in China are changing anyway, even without radical robot deployment,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.920]   because the workforce is getting better paid.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:39.080]   They're slowly cracking down on environmental things, which is raising costs.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.000]   And they actually have something of a labor shortage.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.580]   And when you look at the sheer number, in that article, they were talking about their
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:50.360]   high, they're still, after all these robots go in, they're still adding 100,000 new workers.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.520]   I don't know of any American, I can't think of it the last time any American company said,
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.880]   we're just going to add 100,000 workers.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:01.800]   There isn't 100,000 people in the United States that could be trained to do this tomorrow.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.800]   That's right.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:07.400]   And I have the feeling that the alternative to manufacturing in China is not necessarily
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:11.480]   manufacturing in Silicon Valley or something like that.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.800]   The alternative is often going to be Mexico or Brazil.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:18.000]   But a lot of the way China does this is not specifically in that location with Foxconn,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.120]   is not just because of the cost, it's because of the scale.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.920]   It's Foxconn's ability to add 100,000 people and have a system for that.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.360]   I don't think that's replaceable.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:33.600]   I don't think that that's going to be replaceable by many other countries or anytime soon.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.800]   The fact that they can do that, it makes them irreplaceable in that sense.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.320]   It's not just the wages.
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.120]   And do we think there's a trend toward trying to move manufacturing?
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.560]   I've heard people write this and I've always been kind of like, "Huh, that doesn't say.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.560]   I'm not sure that that's a trend."
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.320]   But you know, Mac Pros are being manufactured in the United States.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.000]   The Sapphire plant is in the United States.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.760]   Is Apple increasingly building things in the United States or is that just a couple of
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.760]   attacks?
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.400]   I think there's a lot of attacks.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.640]   The problem is that there's a lot of tax reasons not to build everything in the United States.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:12.640]   I think from a purely corporate perspective, it makes sense to do certain things that you
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.320]   want to have a lot of control and quality and everything else.
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.440]   So that makes sense.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.360]   These are small chunks of that.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:25.400]   But I'm not clear that it makes sense for Apple to assemble the final product in the
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:29.200]   United States bluntly just for tax reasons.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.200]   And of course-
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.520]   I mean, it depends on what components you're talking about too.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.560]   One of the advantages of SenGen in China is that everything is in very close proximity.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.600]   So famously you have a problem with one component.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.400]   You can walk next door, get it fixed and everything gets fixed much faster.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.600]   Apple can just send a few people to China, make a monitor that.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.800]   But certain components like the Gorilla Glass has been manufactured in the US.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:53.840]   The Apple A series process has been manufactured in the US because those made more sense there.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.660]   And I think it's less about arbitrary geography decisions than how they can holistically
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:05.380]   make their product they need to make at the yield rate, which is as important as the cost
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.740]   in the right time for them to ship.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:13.140]   And of course, like Tesla, Apple is planning to fully automate and robotize their battery
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.140]   manufacturing.
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:15.580]   For reasons I don't know.
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:19.740]   I don't know why batteries are something that lend themselves to robot manufacturing.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.740]   But-
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:23.620]   There was a pushback on that article this morning, I think, from some of the Chinese media saying
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:26.660]   that they were talking about the robots in terms of the grossest tasks.
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.380]   Like the fine detail tasks will still be done by human beings, but the things that could
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:34.340]   be batch processed and the things that didn't require as fine a touch would be moved over
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.340]   to the robots.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.020]   And there's some things that robots can do.
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.980]   When you look at, for instance, surface mounting, a human can't do that.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:45.100]   So when you get to certain miniaturization and so on and so forth, the robots allow you
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:50.620]   to do things that you just simply can't do with a person.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:54.780]   And I think there are some things definitely the final fitting and the final things that
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:59.900]   will take another decade before robots do it.
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:03.500]   But definitely we're going to get to a point where you have a small number of people managing
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:04.700]   a large number of robots.
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.660]   There's another line that comes to mind that you teach a worker to install a component
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.700]   in a phone and you employ them for the life cycle of that phone.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:18.580]   Teach the person to program the robot or maintain the robot that installs that component and
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:19.780]   you employ them for life.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:24.460]   That's the Shenzhen version of the teacher-man to fish.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.460]   So what are you going to do?
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:31.620]   And you don't want to tell a fox-con worker that you mean that I could spend my day just
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.020]   fishing and eating the...
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.020]   Wow!
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:35.020]   What am I doing?
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.020]   I'm here!
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.020]   Outside?
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.020]   That's right.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:41.660]   Well, then you just tell them that, oh, well, realize that you will be fishing in China.
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.540]   The air is a lot cleaner inside this factory, believe me.
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:46.540]   Even though it's toxic.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:50.820]   Yeah, it's an interesting world building there.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.380]   And one final point is what's a robot?
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:56.300]   I mean, modern factory equipment these days is robotized.
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:57.300]   It's automated.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:01.220]   And a lot of this is fox-con bragging about how high-tech they are.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:03.900]   Well, in just a sec, we're going to get to our picks of the week.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:08.060]   But first, I want to tell you about the greatest place in the world to build a website.
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.140]   I'm talking, of course, about one of our sponsors, which is Squarespace.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.380]   I've been using Squarespace for many years.
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.460]   I build multiple websites on Squarespace.
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.940]   Excuse me.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:22.700]   And this is a fantastic site because they really nail all the key points of building a great
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:23.700]   website.
[01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.260]   The first one, of course, is Design.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.820]   They have 25 beautiful templates for you to start with.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:32.940]   And you can go in there and just use their EDC to use tools to tweak and change your design.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.940]   You can change the typography.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:34.940]   You can add pages.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.380]   You can add functionality.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:39.620]   And one of the key things that you can add is e-commerce.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:44.700]   If you need to raise money, if you need to sell things on your website, all subscription
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.780]   plan levels at Squarespace support e-commerce now.
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:52.060]   So you can, if you have a wedding registry or you want to raise money for your nonprofit,
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:56.220]   or if you just like selling stuff, it's easy to use, easy to set up.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.780]   And again, it's at all subscription plan levels.
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.620]   This all sounds very expensive, but it's $8 a month.
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:02.820]   It starts at $8 a month.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:06.220]   And that includes a free domain name if you sign up for a year.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:10.420]   And hosting is included, of course, and it's very difficult and maybe impossible to bring
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:13.780]   a Squarespace site down with any sort of attack.
[01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:15.940]   I know Leo's tried at a gazillion times.
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:21.100]   He's thrown all the Twit traffic at it for the Sunday show Twit and has been unable to
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.020]   bring down these sites.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:25.780]   Very importantly, Squarespace is mobile ready.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.380]   They're mobile ready in two ways.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:31.460]   The first is that as somebody who's managing your website, you can use their Squarespace
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:36.300]   metric app for iPhone and iPad to check sites, stats, like page views, unique visitors,
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.180]   social media followers, and that follows, and that sort of thing.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.580]   But it's also mobile ready from the end user's point of view.
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:46.260]   Squarespace will automatically sort of redesign your site on the fly if somebody's looking
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:51.140]   at it with an iPhone or any sort of phone or tablet or a laptop or whatever.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:55.940]   It'll always look right for the device people are using to look at your site.
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:12:00.540]   So start a free two-week trial with no credit card required and start building your website.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.260]   When you decide to sign up for Squarespace, make sure you use the offer code MACBreak
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:07.620]   to get 10% off to show your support for MACBreak Weekly.
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.780]   And we thank Squarespace for their support of this show.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:15.300]   And remember that a better web awaits and it starts with your new Squarespace website.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.660]   My number one proof of this?
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:17.660]   Yes.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:18.660]   Familiarlight.com.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.500]   Okay, check it out.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:23.900]   This is my sister's site.
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:28.620]   My sister's a great photographer, but she's not super technical.
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:32.220]   She knows what she needs to know about what she does, but she is the best photographer
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:33.860]   actually that I've ever met.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:36.540]   And so she puts out this thing over family talking about taking pictures of your family
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.260]   and friends and pennies for some reason.
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.780]   I don't know why the pennies are up there.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:44.500]   But this all took her putting this together and it's not a very complicated site.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.500]   I understand that.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:51.900]   But it is something that someone with no technical web background just kind of threw together
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:57.700]   and it totally works for her posting those things up without any, really any technology.
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.700]   She did it all by herself.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.980]   And she just told me when it was available so she didn't even ask for any help.
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.460]   And you say that's your sister?
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.460]   That's my sister, yeah.
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:08.500]   All right, well I'll see your sister and raise you a niece.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.020]   My niece's website is joyarose.com.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:15.380]   And that's J-O-Y-A-R-O-S-E.com.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:18.820]   And she just put this site up, a Squarespace site, I think, a couple of weeks ago or something
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:19.820]   like that.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:20.820]   She's a designer.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.340]   She's just starting a business for different types of design.
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:28.180]   And again, very talented with physical media.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.180]   Great.
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:32.780]   But not a geek, even though her father is actually a software developer.
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:39.500]   But she's not really that interested in messing around with a website and writing HTML code.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.180]   And it ends up beautiful and she loves it.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:45.100]   It's easy and she has control of it.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:48.660]   That's for creative people, that's very important to be able to have control without having to
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:49.660]   get, you know, a solution.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:52.340]   It's all WYG, you're figuring it out.
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.340]   And you can add a lot to it.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:56.740]   So both like, Picsacore website is all Squarespace as well.
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:00.660]   But we've got lots of we injected custom code into it where we wanted to, where it didn't
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:03.780]   have everything that we wanted, but most of it is all WYG that we can change anytime
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:04.780]   we want.
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:05.780]   Not that we do very often.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:07.780]   It's all another story.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:10.940]   All right, so when we do the Pics of the Week on this show, who usually goes first?
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:12.580]   Whoever you tell them to go first.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.580]   Okay, would you like to go first?
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:15.580]   Sure.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:16.580]   All right.
[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:20.300]   So a new version of, it's called Call Out.
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:24.700]   And this is made by, I can never remember the name of the company.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.900]   Ripple training is the people that make it.
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.700]   So the guys that do Mac Break Studio.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:34.100]   So this is Mark and Steve built this ingenious plugin called Call Out.
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.740]   Now what Call Out does is for Final Cut Pro and Noise Industries is the company that
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.940]   actually sells it for them.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:44.620]   But what it does is it may sound simple, but if you're doing training or if you're doing
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:50.260]   promos for your product in video, one of the things that is a real like drives you crazy
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:55.140]   is making the little arrows and the little like, this is how this works and little magnifying
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:56.140]   glasses that pop up.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.940]   I can not tell you how many times I've had to do a lot of work to make magnifying glasses
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.540]   work in a video.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.860]   So instead of doing all of that, this does it automatically.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:08.620]   So this is a great little thing and you can very easily move little map things around.
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:13.860]   So when you're doing, whether it's presentations for training, for, as you can see, these little
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:14.860]   bits and pieces.
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:18.540]   Now this may seem like a simple thing, but it is a simple thing that there's some of
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:22.220]   you out there that are watching this right now that just went, "Oh, I need that right
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.220]   now."
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:27.900]   Because this is all stuff that it looks simple and you're constantly, it's a lot of work
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:31.780]   to do it well, especially if you're doing it in like five minutes of it.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:35.100]   And so being able to just kind of throw this stuff out there and edit it very quickly and
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:38.980]   make it easy and have it animate is just a great value add.
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:42.740]   And so for those of you who do video, who do any kind of training or any of those other
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:47.460]   things, this is kind of, it's like, I think it's like 80 bucks or something or 60 bucks.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:52.980]   And it is worth every, you know, you'll get your return in like the first project.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:58.140]   So anyway, but that's called a call out 2.0 and the newest industry sells it.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.140]   Wow.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.260]   That looks really great.
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.260]   It's awesome.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:05.220]   Andy and Natko, what do you got for us today?
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.980]   A simple, damn simple thing.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:13.300]   This is a phone slash tablet stand called Stump Stand that, believe it or not, I was
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:18.260]   given as a as a goodie bag item a couple of years ago, but as things tend to do in my
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:21.900]   office, they tend to go into a box or a shelf until I'm poking around and saying, "I need
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:23.620]   something to do with this."
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:27.580]   And then belatedly last month, I realized that this is probably one of the nicest tablet
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.420]   stash slants stands you can get.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:32.860]   It's about 25 bucks, but what it is is it's perfectly designed.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.540]   It's made out of heavy, heavy rubber.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.700]   You can actually feel that it's got some weight to it.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:40.500]   So not only the weight and the rubber means that it's just not going to slide around.
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.860]   The other great thing about it is that look at the profile where it's got this little
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.460]   notch cutout things for two stage thing.
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:50.480]   Another thing I don't like about many of these stands is that they're good for this one
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.260]   thing that you have at the time that you bought it, but then a year passes and now you switch
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:57.720]   to a different phone or you put your phone in a case or you switch to a different tablet.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.400]   And now this thing is no good anymore.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.800]   But this one, it's so flexible.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.500]   Here it is on an iPhone 5 without a case.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:08.040]   Here it is with a Nexus 5 with a very, very thick case put into it.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.380]   Here it is supporting a thin, nice thin tablet without a case.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:17.440]   Here it is with the iPad, the iPad Air inside its case.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.340]   So you don't have to take it out of that case in order to stick it on your nightstand.
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:24.540]   And actually you want to be really silly.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:29.180]   Here it is on the Kindle Fire HDX.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.020]   Inside its case, not even opened.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:35.020]   And believe it or not, you can get it inside the, you can't get it inside the release if
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.700]   you've returned around the right way.
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.060]   And you don't have to, the great thing is if you're using this as like a desktop thing
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:45.280]   or even as a nightstand alarm clock, you don't have to remove your phone or your tablet from
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.260]   your case in order to use this thing as a stand.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:49.960]   It's not going to get knocked over.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.020]   It's going to support the full way to the thing.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.700]   And if you switch to a different tablet or a different phone or if you put something into
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:00.340]   a battery case later on, you're not going to have to take your phone out of your battery
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:02.940]   case maybe in order to put it inside this.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.220]   So nice and, it's a very flexible solution.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:09.740]   It's about 25 bucks, which is not a whole lot of money, not cheap, but right in the
[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:10.740]   middle of the bandwidth.
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:17.240]   I like to think of it as, think of it as the cost of the four, $15 stands you will buy
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:23.400]   over two or three years because you don't have to keep replacing a stand every time you
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.320]   replace your hardware.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.960]   Fantastic.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.440]   And how much was that again?
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.760]   It's about 25 bucks.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.760]   You can go to StumpStore.com.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:34.040]   That's where they've got like all the fashion colors, but you can get it Amazon pretty much
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.040]   anywhere else.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:40.640]   It's been around for a few years, but they, it is still an active product as a nervous
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.620]   sleep check this morning before choosing it as my pick of the week.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:48.380]   They're doing the typical like Apple thing where yes, it looks the same, but let me tell
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.620]   you about the differences we've made in the manufacturing.
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:54.300]   That's fantastic.
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:55.700]   Very Apple-esque.
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.700]   And that is a huge problem.
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:00.820]   I have a little stand that I use for my iPad and then I've got a new case and then it
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:01.820]   doesn't fit anymore.
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:05.780]   And then it's like now you have this piece of junk paperweight that you can't use for
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.420]   a really bad reason.
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.900]   So that looks like a really super great product.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:13.560]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.960]   So I have a tip rather than a pick this week and I was talking to a friend of mine and
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:21.040]   he goes on hiking trips.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.800]   And one of the things that he did is because he has an iPhone 5S with Touch ID is he registered
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.040]   one of the guides fingerprints on Touch ID just because it was at a rather precarious,
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.560]   almost dangerous area.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:38.040]   It was a highly advanced hike and he was worried that if anything happened to him, you know,
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.040]   there might be some trouble.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.980]   So he wanted to make sure that whoever was there could get into his phone.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.860]   You know, you could make emergency calls, but he wanted, you know, the right context
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:47.380]   to be accessed and he wanted to have a higher level.
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:48.380]   He trusted this person.
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.760]   So he wanted to have a higher level of access for them.
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:55.180]   And previous to this, you'd have to share your four-digit passcode or your alphanumeric
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.180]   password with them.
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:57.660]   They'd have to remember it.
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.060]   Maybe they have several to remember.
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.340]   And then when you want to take away their access, you'd have to change the passcode or
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.780]   password and you'd have to remember the new one.
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:08.840]   And now it's as simple as registering a fingerprint and then deleting it when you're done.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.240]   So I started looking around for similar stories and, you know, there are some families who
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.280]   previously didn't leave, didn't protect their device at all because it was inconvenient
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280]   in the household.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.760]   And then there was ever a burglary or something got lost.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.000]   The device was just completely not protected.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.160]   Anyone could get into it and do anything they wanted with it.
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:30.080]   And with Touch ID, they can register their fingerprints, their partner's fingerprints,
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.280]   kids' fingerprints.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:36.260]   If they're worried about their kids buying stuff on the store, you can toggle that part
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:37.260]   of Touch ID off.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:40.340]   But they could make something that their kids could get into if they needed to, again, to
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:46.940]   make an emergency contact or just to watch a video or play a game if they're traveling.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.940]   And I even heard from somebody who used it in business because they have a small team
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:53.100]   and previously they'd have to change the password on the device that they were using
[01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:57.180]   for, I think it was order processing or order taking or something.
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:00.700]   Anytime someone left or moved in the team and now they just register and de-register
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:01.800]   their fingerprints.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.840]   So it's really become this, you have a lower level of security, but because of stuff like
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.560]   Touch ID, the convenience factor has greatly increased.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.920]   And I think soon with iOS 8 and Touch ID is going to move to other devices like iPads,
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.160]   I think it's going to be really beneficial because you'll have individual apps and also
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:24.200]   a wide range of devices that'll be just that easy to have security on but grant to revoke
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.000]   access whenever you want.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   Hmm.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   Sounds awesome.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   Absolutely awesome.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.060]   My pick of the week this week is the DOTA case.
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.440]   Now I know what you're thinking.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:34.440]   You heard about this.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:38.380]   This is an old product and of course this is a high quality case made with bamboo and
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:39.840]   canvas and stuff like that.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:44.140]   I got this as actually a Father's Day gift from my son Kevin.
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:50.440]   And I originally had a DOTA case for my first, I guess it was the iPad when it was sort of
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:55.520]   like rumored and then you could pre-order it and a year later I got it and I finally
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.520]   got my hands on it.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:00.280]   I had 10 people in the universe who had this big deal and there was a lot of press around
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.080]   the DOTA case and the company back then.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.480]   And the hype kind of dies down.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.360]   Lots of other cases get into the limelight.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:13.680]   But this, having revisited this, this is for my iPad Air, this is a beautiful case and
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:19.120]   I've also in exploring this learned a lot more about what the company has been doing
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:22.880]   in the last four years I guess since this thing has been around.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:26.440]   So just to review what this case can actually do, I don't know if you can get the camera
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:30.920]   on the table here but of course this is, let's put that in there.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.840]   You set it up and angle it up like that if you want it like that.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.920]   You can also tilt it back using this thing.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.440]   This little plastic bit right here if you can see that holds it up in a different, you
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.240]   know if you're going to do a presentation mode, I won't demo that.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.040]   But this is a super high quality case that will really protect it and it looks really
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:49.400]   nice when you're carrying it around.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.040]   Now what are they discovered about the company that they've been doing since and I don't
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:57.560]   think it gets a whole lot of press is they have custom cases that you can just go in
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:03.960]   there and pick all kinds of colors and you can do sort of map inserts and book bound
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.600]   style and you know all kinds of really great stuff.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.440]   And this is made here in San Francisco in the Bay Area.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:12.800]   It's a really high quality company and when you have a MacBook Air I bought into the
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.240]   whole thing with Apple.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.680]   When they came out with the MacBook Air they said this is the thinnest tablet ever and
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:24.440]   our little case, the little magnetic case is the thinnest way to protect your iPad.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.320]   I hate that cover.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.320]   It's just horrible.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:30.280]   One of the reasons is that I have a metal desk and it's magnetic and when I try to
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:35.280]   pick up the iPad that the iPad goes with me and the case stays behind.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.600]   But the other reason is if you don't get the, if you want to put it up for you to use it
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:45.600]   for typing or whatever, if you don't get the magnet fully engaged the thing just collapses.
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.080]   And I've dropped my iPad.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.240]   I gave up on that case a long time ago.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.240]   It's terrible.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:56.840]   This feels like what you want with an iPad Air because it's high quality, it's fully
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:57.840]   protected.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.600]   You can carry it around, you know, like you, I travel a lot.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:05.240]   It's got to some places where you know you have an iPad, you walk in down the street with
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240]   an iPad.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.680]   It's you know it's a big deal and you don't want it to be a big deal.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.440]   You can walk down the street with this and it looks like a boring ledger or something
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:13.440]   like that.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.560]   It has a concealing quality to it.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.760]   These range in the 60s, mid 60s to the 70s depending on whether you get the custom or
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.120]   the generic they have, you know, again lots of colors.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.000]   They have metallic colors even though they're not metal.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   They're just a copper and things like that.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.200]   Beautiful cases, high quality and they're exactly what you want when you have an iPad
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.920]   because you can take it anywhere.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:37.840]   And then don't tell my wife but I think I'm going to get her that heart one because she's
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.840]   obsessed with hearts.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.960]   If you look at that it's a beautiful design right there.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.400]   So I love the book plate.
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.280]   That is the candle on the top of the cake, the book plate.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:55.960]   It's a signature feature and it just really gives it a classic feel.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:56.960]   I like it.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.240]   So that's my pick of the week.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:02.680]   Well, before we say I have one tip that is timely.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:08.000]   So I just want to make sure I forgot to say it as we all travel a lot.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.720]   Just a little note if you're traveling now, make sure that you charge your iPhones and
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.400]   your Macs and everything else before you go to the airport.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.840]   TSA is changing their rules and they are now making you and I've already seen it start
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:24.120]   to happen on flights to the US and I don't know about flights within the US but I just
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.600]   saw it in Istanbul.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.760]   They want you to turn your electronic devices on.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.640]   They want to see them actually power up.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:38.640]   There's evidently some chatter about using mobile phones and so on and so forth for bad
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.640]   things.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:45.040]   So just don't show up with a dead iPhone.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.720]   You may lose it because you will.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.720]   They'll keep it.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.400]   They'll let you charge it once but if you can't come up with it pretty quickly they're
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.480]   going to take it from you.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.160]   So just definitely make sure that that's just something that's happening this week or
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.320]   I've just seen it and I'm really glad that I charge everything.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:04.120]   Those are glad along flights and I just wanted everything working but anyway something to
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   keep in mind.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.680]   So Istanbul is one certain airport.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.440]   Another one is the UK's airport.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.640]   What is the heat room?
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.000]   That one for sure they're doing the same thing.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   So will they take it or will they simply not let you pass with it?
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   No they'll take it.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   Like you have the chin.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   No that's the thing.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   Okay there's a lot you charge it.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.960]   I will turn around.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.680]   I will go back into the find a power out.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.680]   Let give me 20 minutes.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.080]   I'll come back and I'll show it working.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.160]   They'll like no but they'll let you charge it.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.560]   Now I haven't seen anybody have it taken away from them but the reports that I've seen
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.320]   are they will let you charge it but if you come with something that isn't working it
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:42.600]   has to work before you leave or they're not going to let you wander off with it as well.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:45.680]   They're going to want to see you charge it right there and if you can't.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.320]   If it doesn't come up that's the report that I've heard.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.920]   I haven't seen any that actually happens so I can't say one way or the other but the
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:55.880]   report is you'll get a chance to charge it but if you don't charge it it doesn't react
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.440]   you're not going to get it back because they're going to take it apart.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.920]   That's the and so.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:03.520]   So what if I buy I'm sorry this is a digression but what
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:09.560]   if I buy a piece of electronics overseas and try to take it back with me as as is my right.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:10.560]   I'm giving it as a gift.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.360]   I'll have to tear it apart off the charged up.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:16.480]   I can't take a sealed box even if they're going to be screening it during and through
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.480]   the X-ray.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.960]   I think that if you if you check it you're okay although then you're the risk of checking
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:22.960]   it.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:23.960]   I think if you check it.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:24.960]   I think if you check it.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.880]   It's the finer points that I'm still trying to get answers on.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:27.880]   I'm not sure.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:28.880]   I don't know the answer for that.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.960]   I think that if you checked it you probably you know the the level of X-ray that the check
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.680]   bags go through is much different than the one that you're because it would kill you
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.800]   if you did that all the time.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:43.720]   But the but I think that that it's checked stuff I think is okay is it's carry on that
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.040]   you're because they don't want to have you have access to it.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:52.280]   You know in the you know obviously we can think of many permutations that would get
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.680]   around that but I think that that currently is the issue is that if you bought something
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:01.560]   like that and had it a box you would probably want want to put it in a put it in your check
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:05.800]   baggage which is has its own risks if you're coming from the emerging world.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.880]   But it's just something that mostly I don't you should definitely research it that's all
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:13.600]   I'm saying I'm not going to say I agree with it disagree with it but I've already seen it
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:17.640]   happen and so you definitely want to keep that in mind because it's not in you because
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.560]   I know people who've gone through it metal detectors and had the metal detector go off
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.960]   and it was because of a non visible piercing and they had to actually show that it was
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:28.000]   that piercing and not something else that they were trying to smuggle through.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.400]   Yeah so take it out and then bring it back and show that there was an actual piercing
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.400]   of all did not something else.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.920]   They didn't want you to use that as just used to get something else through.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:41.760]   So that's why those of you with unusual piercings you're here to fight our battles for us.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:47.400]   I want you to put in the full metal jacket and just really just set off the detector
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.440]   force them to like to show to really gross them out with this thing that you've done
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:56.040]   to that thing of yours because really you'll be flying the flag of retribution for all
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.040]   of us.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.040]   So if you're freaking out we can take a tow with our.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040]   Put it back in.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040]   Go go.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:06.560]   Well yeah it's one of their point from this news by the way is that they're singling out
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:10.080]   iPhone iPhones and also Samsung phones.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:16.320]   The chatter around this new type of bomb that can be placed into a undetected into a phone
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:20.600]   is that it's probably they're doing it with iPhones and Samsung phones.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.920]   Specifically Galaxy line phones.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:28.600]   So if you got an iPhone and you're traveling make sure it's charged that's the advice.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.480]   It's dumb it's and I'll tell you why it's dumb if something the size of an iPhone can
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.240]   conceal a bomb then you can just put that into a bootable laptop walk right in low
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.240]   up the plane.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.600]   No I have to charge my laptop to a thanks Mike.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.560]   Yeah you ruined everything for everybody I didn't want to mention that because no I'm
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.160]   going to know that's right.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.280]   And on that bummer of a note I would like to conclude this exciting episode of Mac break
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.320]   weekly and the Anatko Chicago Sun times.

[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.520]   Nice to have you in center square.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.280]   Well thank you so much appreciate it.

[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:15.480]   Thank you so much for all of your contributions today.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.480]   Great stuff as always.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.480]   Always great talking to Mike.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:19.920]   Alright and Alex Lindsay I'm sorry we didn't get to the question engine.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:20.920]   It's fine.
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:26.280]   It's all caught up in all the important questions about who Apple is hiring for their iWatch
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:27.720]   program that is all good.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720]   Spaced out on it.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.640]   So when is your next trip?
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640]   Later today.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.640]   No no tomorrow morning.
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.480]   We're going to Portland tomorrow and then in the North Carolina.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.400]   I theoretically will be on something that looks like a vacation next week.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:44.360]   But I'm going to try to connect from Cape Hatteras North Carolina for Mac break.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:45.360]   We'll see what kind of connection.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.600]   I'm tempted to take our satellite just to see if it'll work.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.640]   You must have some serious miles on your card.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.160]   I'm stacking them up.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.240]   I want to thank all the miles.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:59.560]   Yeah so I want to thank all of you and Ia Naco Renee Richie Alex Lindsay.
