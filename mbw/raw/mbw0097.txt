[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Joining us today, we've got a special live studio full of
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   experts in Macintosh.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And us.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And you.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Starting with Mr. Merlin, actually the other Merlin with
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   a Y, Randall Schwartz of StoneHinge.com, who's chat
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   name is Merlin. Good to have you. Randall also here in studio
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   with us is Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Corner.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Hello, good to have you.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And via Skype, Merlin Man.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And hello, Merlin Man. Have you looked nice today?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   How are you today?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I'm very well. Just got the new You Look Nice today.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Just came out.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Oh, it's a good one.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Is it?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   This is a good one.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I can't wait.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I'm excited.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Finally, we all come to grips with the term with the reality
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   that we're all mouth breathers.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And support stuff around that.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   We're going to have a benefit.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   So anyway.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Don't try and fake being a nosy anymore.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   If you're a mouth breather, get out and be proud.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Breathe it out. Let it go.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Boy, you can hear the AC now, can't you?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I should probably turn the temperature up just a little bit.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It's a little hot here in the Petaluma region.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Hotest.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Hotest.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's been in several hundred years.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's 84 here in the room.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And we're trying to keep it cool.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   So we're going to, I've actually broke down and got an AC.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I've avoided this for a long time.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   It's actually cooler outside than it is in here.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Can you feel the 10,000 BTUs of power right on your back there?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I only feel about 7,000 BTUs.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So I apologize for the noise there.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I'm going to see if I can turn the fan down a little bit.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Turn the temperature up maybe.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So let's talk about what's happening in the world of Macintosh.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Quite a bit.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Actually, as it turns out.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Drama.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Drama.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   The iPhone comes out, well, technically tomorrow, 5 a.m.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Pacific time is midnight.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I think.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   New Zealand time.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I think that's right.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   New Zealand time.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   So midnight on the 11th, 1201 on the 11th, they go on sale.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   In New Zealand.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And then we're going to slowly go all the way around the world until they finally get on sale in Hawaii.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I think it'll be 11 o'clock on the 11th.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Does iPhone 2.0 come out concurrently?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   When do we get the new software?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Good question.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   No, it hasn't come out last couple days.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   They haven't made an announcement about that?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   No, not that I saw any.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Let me check.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I should see.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I may have upgraded your phone, Alex, without even...
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Geez.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Is that a hacked phone that we just plugged into my system?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It's not a hacked phone.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I just didn't have the energy.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's locked with the passcode, so I can't mess with it.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Wow, I didn't know the passcode made a difference when you...
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It does.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I can't mess with it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   That should, because if you plug in a phone, if you're trying to hack somebody's phone and you plug it into your iTunes and you can sync it, that's really not very secure.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   So the fact that you're using a passcode, that's good news.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   What happened was I left my phone in a rental car.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I got it back.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   But I didn't have a passcode on it, and I did after that.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Oh, yeah, I can imagine.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   That was kind of the end of that.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I didn't want to play anymore.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Never again.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I'm very interested to see what 2.0 has in store.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I'm not going to upgrade, I don't think, to the new iPhone.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   In fact, I gave name the old iPhone, but I do have an iPod Touch, and I get 2.0 on the iPod Touch.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   So I'm looking forward to the...
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   But you're not moving up.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   There's nothing there that you need.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   You know, I'm not...
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Well, we'll see.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Timmy, I'm not really excited about it.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   The Big Four have their reviews out.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Now, Walt Mossberg's review has come out.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Anybody want to take a guess whether Walt likes it or not?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I think that Walt Mossberg and Steve Jobs have a secret relationship to going on.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Symbiosis.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   There's a lot of special.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Walt says, "Apple's iPhone has been the world's most influential spark smartphone since his debut a year ago,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   widely hailed for its beauty and functionality."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It was...
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I can't even read this.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I'm a gag.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It's not all.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   It's not all-fawning.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   No, is there some stuff he doesn't like?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I think the battery thing is pretty significant.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   What does he say about the battery?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   One drawback.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Let's see.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I'm looking at it for the first time that it just came out.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Apple claims that over 3G, the new iPhone can get five hours of talk time,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   or five hours of internet use.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Talk time is twice as long as the older Edge network internet time and hour better with Wi-Fi.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I ran my own battery test using the phone's 3G capability,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   although I left the Wi-Fi function on.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I didn't connect it to a network.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   The phone had to rely on 3G.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   In my test of voice calling, I got four and a half hours.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Not bad.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Three hours less than what I recorded on the same test on the original iPhone last year.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Using 3G, five hours, 49 minutes, better than Apple's claim,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   but shorter than nine hours using Wi-Fi last year.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   More important in daily use, I found the battery indicator of the new 3G model slipping below 20%
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   by early afternoon or mid-afternoon in some cases.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   That's bad.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You got to get through a day.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It entirely ran out of juice on one day.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I overcame this problem by learning to use Wi-Fi instead of 3G,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   wherever possible, turning down the screen brightness,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   even turning off 3G altogether when the phone permits.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Actually, which the phone is?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I think this would be a big business for Mophie.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Oh, Mophie is that makes that case.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I have one.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I don't have it with me.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I love that idea.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It's a case of the battery.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Do you use it?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   The Mophie is a little case that you pop onto your iPhone.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   You slide your iPhone into it.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And what's kind of cool about it is that when you slide it in,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   it gives you basically another iPhone battery worth of time.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   But it's charging the first battery.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So a lot of times what happens, I always make sure,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   sitting in my office, the Mophie is just charged.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's always charged.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And if I'm running around and things aren't, you know, I've been traveling
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   and I have it charged sitting there.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   It's kind of my backup.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So I just leave my, I don't use it all the time,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   but my iPhone's getting low and I don't have time to plug it in.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I just shove it into the Mophie and then I just can keep on using it.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And then when the Mophie has given its charge--
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   How many hours do you get the-- oh, it charges it up?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   It's basically acting like an external charger.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   So then when the Mophie runs out of battery time,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I then have an iPhone that'll keep on going.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You know, and so that actually has, it's turned into a really,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   really useful.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Similar to the external battery pack so they make for laptops and stuff that.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   But it's in a case and it doesn't really make the phone that much bigger.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   You know, it's nice.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I'll tell you something really odd about it is that when you put your iPhone
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   into it, your iPhone feels more solid.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Huh.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I mean, there's this thing where it just, there's something about it,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   the extra, a small amount of extra weight has actually,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   actually makes it feel like when you're hitting the button,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   it just feels like you're hitting something a little bit harder,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   a little bit more solid, and there's parts of it that I like.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   It's a little bit larger.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I wish, I actually wish that it was smooth, like, slidey.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It's got kind of a rubbery so it doesn't slide off.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   But the problem with that is that it, that I like just dropping my own in my pocket.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   You like the slippery.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Oh yeah, I don't like it if it grabs a pocket.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   That's not good.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   It doesn't grab it very much.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I still can slide it in and out, but that would be my only thing.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   But I think that when I travel a lot, the Mophie is key to the operation now.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So I really, really like it.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   This is really cool.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It helped.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I turned it off so that we wouldn't have so much noise now that it's cool off a little bit.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   But it's nice.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   We've stopped.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   We've stopped.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It's down to 84.6 now.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I can turn it back.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Now that we're doing video, you have to pay attention to that.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You do.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   It's kind of bad.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So do you think there's been several reviews like that?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Do you think that's going to affect the decision-making on people who...
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   The battery life?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.280]   You know, I think it was to be expected, and in fact, in some ways it sounds like it's
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.000]   better than, you know, the Apple Saturn.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.400]   Especially in the context of all the other stuff.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.600]   I mean, I guess I hate to sound, I don't know what's on negative, but I mean, it's
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   to me when you stack all the stuff up with the extra costs and the costs here and there,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.520]   and all just everything about this.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.600]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   I mean, I've changed my mind.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.080]   I don't think I'm going to quote unquote upgrade.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.560]   I'm not sure I'm going to get that much more out of it.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.000]   Maybe I've just gotten used to the Edge network, but I don't know.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.760]   That just doesn't sound like that much great new added stuff to me, given what the costs
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.000]   end up being in the end.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.720]   Yeah, for me, the Edge network has been fine for the times that I needed, and in random
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.920]   times I'm actually in a Wi-Fi area that I've been happy about that, but I really haven't
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.480]   found Edge to be that low, but this is my first smartphone too.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.320]   So maybe the thing is, you know, I'm not spoiled yet by the faster speeds, and that's
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   why it didn't look like going down.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.120]   I think, Ian, I think the thing that you and you and I are going to be watching for
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.360]   probably is what the apps end up doing.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.800]   Because I'm always prepared to change my mind on this stuff based on how you actually
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.040]   end up using it.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.480]   And I mean, you just hear so much chatter from very reliable people about what's going
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.720]   to be happening with these apps.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.600]   And I'm ready to have my mind blown in terms of what the apps will do.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.080]   Thing is, you can do that with an old iPhone.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   You know, there's not--
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080]   Except for the GPS.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   GPS.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.960]   Yeah, but I mean, the location stuff, I don't know.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   Anyway, we'll see.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.960]   We'll have to see.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.280]   I'm not sure there's not that much that I can see myself using GPS for right now in
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.480]   my head on the iPhone that I wouldn't rather do on my newbie.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.480]   One of the apps I have on my iPhone, now mine's cracked, so I've got the only extra
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.760]   stuff being installed on it.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.720]   But one of them is a find the nearest restaurant and read reviews about it.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   I forget the name of the actual app.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.920]   But it's really kind of cool.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.240]   And if that's the kind of thing that starts showing up for real on the new iPhone, and
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.040]   you can only get to it because of GPS instead of the--
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:06.160]   I guess they're leveraging off the cell phone location stuff in the old iPhone.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.680]   But if that's showing up for the new one, then I will be running down to get it.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.680]   I also--
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.560]   I travel a lot and I carry my TomTom with me all the time.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:21.920]   And if the GPS gives me turn by turn well enough that I can keep from having to carry
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.680]   my TomTom around, it'll be worth it to carry one less gadget on the plane.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.680]   It'll do.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.920]   The GPS will do like Google Map turn by turn.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920]   So it does it ahead of time.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.880]   You say, here's where I am, here's where I'm going.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.280]   It does the whole Google Map thing.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.480]   But it doesn't say turn left now, turn right now.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   I don't need it to announce it.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.480]   I just need to know roughly where I currently am along the plan that was made a while back.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   That's fine.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.360]   I always make a new plan because you know, hey, just say now from here, go from here to my
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.440]   destination.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.400]   If that works well enough that I can leave my TomTom at home, I'll be happy to upgrade
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.800]   just for that aspect of it because I travel 25 weeks a year and most of it in the US and
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.440]   so this will be great.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.040]   It's all an unknown really until we see what they do.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.960]   But that's why I'm not in line on Friday.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   I don't--
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   Me too.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.960]   I don't feel any urgency because I'm stuck here.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.960]   I'm stuck.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.640]   I'm going to be here doing the 24 hours of iPhone thing, which would be fun talking to people
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.040]   as they get iPhones.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.880]   But it doesn't bother me that much that I'm not going to be able to actually go out and
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.520]   run out and get one.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.240]   I'm not feeling too bad about that.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.760]   You know, part of being a grown up is being able to wait a couple days.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.760]   I'm not good at that.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.760]   I went at six hours for the first time.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.960]   But also, it's really going to be worth waiting to see a couple of things.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.480]   First of all, obviously, you're going to want to see what your friends say when they go
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.160]   out and the early adopters go out and buy this thing and leave it open, leave every possible
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.680]   service open all the time.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.560]   I'm going to be able to figure out how that performance is.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.760]   Second, what do we really get on the day it comes out with iPhone 2 stuff?
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.720]   I think that's potentially pretty big.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.800]   And third, obviously, what the apps do.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.400]   And then, you know, I think, again, like how many people, like people like me, ended
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.240]   up wanting an iPhone on the basis of playing with one looking at somebody else.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.600]   You were really held off.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.240]   You held off a couple of months, didn't you?
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.040]   Well, I just didn't have a place in my life.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.680]   I mean, it's still something I could live without.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.160]   I don't use it like a computer like a lot of my friends do.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.240]   I mean, I have friends who don't carry a laptop anymore when they travel.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   All they have is their iPhone.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   I'm not to that point.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.000]   I really, really, really like it.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.360]   But maybe it's some cost fallacy in my head.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.240]   But right now, I'm thinking, even though mine was a gift, still, it's like, wow, I
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.320]   mean, do I really want to go out and spend more money to get in a longer contract with
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   more?
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.080]   I mean, all those fees are crazy.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.160]   Like I'm just, I feel so overfeed right now in my life that just from kind of an ethical
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.080]   standpoint, I just, I don't want to contribute to any more of that.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   I'm kind of with you on that, actually.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.600]   In fact, you know, I think one of the things I noticed right away with a first iPhone
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.240]   is I turned off the Wi-Fi because that was a battery killer.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.640]   Yeah, I'd leave the Wi-Fi off most of the time.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.920]   If you have the push stuff on, my gut is even just the push stuff is going to just drop
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.760]   the needle on this thing at a time.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   I mean, try it.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   Go try leaving.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.760]   I don't know if you guys do this.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.440]   Now, for a day, go out and walk around and leave the most frequent email checking on.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.440]   You know what's cool.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   I'm looking at it.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.080]   Now Ed Begg also has his review in USA Today.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.560]   He is another one of the big four who got, or maybe in this case, big three who got iPhones
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.560]   early.
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.560]   He didn't, you know, do it.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.200]   As far as I can tell, he didn't do a battery life test.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.600]   He talks about GPS.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.960]   He says I was pretty impressed by the accuracy on the new devices I drove along in my car,
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.920]   searched for nearby pizza places, requested directions, alas, the feature begs for audible
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.200]   turn-by-turn directions found on the instinct and others.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.880]   He's saying he hopes a third-party developer will fill the void, but that's not going to
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.440]   happen unless Apple says so.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.240]   Apple seems to be controlling that.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.320]   They have an SDK.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.920]   And I think that what Apple, I could be wrong, but I think that Apple may be trying to be
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.440]   a kingmaker of deciding who's going to, you know, is it going to be Garmin or is it going
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.320]   to be Tom Tom or whoever is going to get exclusive access?
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.720]   They may not want that to happen because of battery life.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.240]   They may have decided, oh, no, we can't, we can't allow it.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.760]   That's what I'm afraid.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.760]   Maybe, maybe.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.880]   But I think that so many people seem to want it.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.880]   That's the thing that's interesting.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.240]   I mean, that's when you think of GPS, I mean, because I have to admit, I wouldn't consider
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.280]   getting a newbie or whatever if I had turned by turn.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.480]   I'm still, you know, I still think I'm going to end up getting some, you know, getting
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.560]   one, updating the current one.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.640]   I have a Tom Tom from my, and I used to use my trio, just turn it on just so I could do
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.160]   that, you know, and carry it around.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.080]   But now I'm thinking of actually getting a unit and I'm thinking of getting the newbie
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.080]   and, but if I could.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.080]   I like the newbie.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.080]   Well, you should look at the dash.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.480]   I really should look at the dash.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.600]   I'll give you a little demo of the dash because it's running on OpenMOCO, the open source.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.600]   Right.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.120]   It was originally designed for a phone, but it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, there's
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.360]   all sorts of little plug-ins and stuff.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.800]   For instance, I could tweet my current location to Twitter just by pressing a button on it.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   Right.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.840]   You could do a lot of the searching and, but the best thing is, I'm talking about this
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.320]   before is it will see what other dash users, what, what their times have been on the same
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.800]   route that it'll tell you track reports from other dash users.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.320]   And I found that to actually be very useful even here in this small town, relatively small
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.320]   town.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.320]   Right.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.920]   So Ed does say that he says that you could turn off 3G to preserve the battery.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.960]   I started receiving low battery warnings towards the end of a busy workday.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.120]   He found myself charging the device overnight the same as the older iPhone.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.120]   Okay.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.160]   But I couldn't juice up the latest device here's something using my Bose SoundDocker Belkin
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.160]   CarKit.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   Apple says there will be adapters to permit, permit charging with certain older accessories.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.400]   So you're going to have to upgrade your accessories to now.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   Weird.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   Isn't that bad?
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   Well, Apple's, I think historically Apple has always been, we don't care about backwards
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.680]   compatibility, we're designing for whatever we're designing for.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680]   Right.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.800]   And I think that, I usually, I'm always surprised if the older stuff works with anything new
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   I buy from Apple.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.840]   Well, I will be happy that they don't have the recessed earphone plug anymore because
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   my edemotics earphones.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   Nice to have regular headphones.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.840]   It's hard to have any little adapters.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.560]   I'm so afraid I'm in a plane that I'm going to drop that while I'm kind of figgling with
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.320]   everything while I'm getting, getting the stuff out.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.840]   The rat tech one is the best one.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.840]   Okay.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.320]   I have this little, the little thing that's about gray and like, but yeah.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.840]   The rat tech one that was nice about it is it's totally flexible.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.080]   It's just like having another cable.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.040]   So you just haven't wrapped up with it.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.720]   I have, I had ones from Monster, the one that you have and the rat tech one.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.120]   And it turned out that the rat tech one, because it was just completely flexible, it
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.280]   just, it was just adding another little extender to it turned out to be, in my opinion, the
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.280]   best solution.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   Great.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.280]   So in the next couple of weeks, I'm either going to get a new iPhone or a new adapter.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.280]   Or get a new adapter.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.280]   Exactly.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   You're going to work either way.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.280]   I'm, you know, I'm going to get one.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.880]   I don't know if I'm going to stand in line to buy one early.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.040]   I think Scott's going to pay someone to stand in line to buy one early.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.480]   You and, you and Scott are coming up here, aren't you, to be part of the 24 hours of iPhone
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   on Friday morning.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.280]   So he won't be able to be in line.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.280]   Right.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.280]   Somebody will be in line.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.280]   Somebody will be in line.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   We'll send, we'll send, I'll send somebody.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.440]   Nobody has to be in, no, he'll have someone in line and then he'll just go over the end.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.440]   Oh yeah.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.440]   Cause he has to activate.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.440]   But that's what happens at the San Francisco score.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.440]   There's all these people, we did the interview with one Merlin and I were down there.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440]   You know, it's all going to be standing.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.440]   No, it wasn't.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.880]   People sitting in there for their husbands or their kids.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.400]   The tire line is stand in.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.400]   That's great.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   It is.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   The beginning of the front half of the whole line.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   Merlin, wasn't that the case?
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   It was almost everybody.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.800]   There were, there were some people who were like kind of confused about kind of what the
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.400]   whole deal was about.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.920]   Who's in line, why and?
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.800]   But see, the last time you didn't have to activate before you got it, right?
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.400]   You go buy it and then activate it at home.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   Now you've got to activate it.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   Now it sounds like, is that what they're doing?
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.720]   It sounds like Apple is, I mean, the rumor is, is Apple is brassy for impact.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.440]   So they are, they are going to not have any, they're going to have people with the little
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.240]   handheld units.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   There have been rumors that they may.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.000]   Yeah, but activation requires, I mean, for instance, if you're, if you already have an
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.520]   iPhone, you've got to bring in, remember the I-ready last week?
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520]   You got to bring in your bill.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   You got to bring all this.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.680]   I don't think the guy with the little PDA handheld is going to be able to do it for you.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.680]   I think you-
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.440]   I thought the bill was only if you were with somebody else's plan in some other country.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.440]   I don't think it's going to be a problem for those of us that are going to be-
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.000]   You got to bring in paperwork, social security number.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   They have to do a credit check.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.240]   Can you do a credit check if you already have an iPhone?
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.600]   And a lot of people, I think a lot of people who are going to buy me in that initial line
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.160]   are going to be people like me who are taking their iPhone and getting a new one.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.160]   Right.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.560]   And I think that for those people, I think that the upgrade I bet you will be very seamless.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.560]   One of our-
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   [laughter]
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.560]   Merlin sounds skeptical.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.880]   I think getting from another phone to this one will be a pain in the neck.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.240]   I think, I think this is going to be another example of the, the Alex Stell research behind
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.240]   this.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.560]   How did you come up with that particular prediction?
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   I can't say.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.560]   He's guessing.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.560]   It's called-
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.800]   I think what it is is that's how you'd like it to go.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   Yeah, wishful guessing.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   We call that.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   Maybe.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.080]   But it could be the case.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.840]   Quadrilius in our chat room sent me a link.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840]   This is an interesting link.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.000]   Wanna- this is from Silicon Alley Insider.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Dan Fromer running.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Wanna- writing.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Wanna sell an iPhone app?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.360]   Got six months to wait in line.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.160]   Apple's iPhone apps platform launching to Friday could be a big hit.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.520]   But if you're a developer who wants to cash in on it, we hope you're patient or have
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.440]   a hook up at Apple, we hear the waiting list to get accepted into Apple's developer program
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.960]   now six months long.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.200]   That is, and I, I applied the day that it was allowed.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.360]   Of course, maybe they looked at my credentials and said he's not going to get it.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360]   [laughter]
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.520]   We're not giving it to him, but I still haven't been approved.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.160]   You shouldn't have put in that request to program in Visual Basic.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   Maybe that was my big mistake.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.560]   I actually think they want that.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.800]   Apparently, Apple says 250,000 people have downloaded the SDK, but that still doesn't
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.680]   allow you to, you know, you could practice, but you're not officially in the club.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.200]   In the club, right.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.520]   And then if you write an app, you've got to then send it to Apple.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.880]   You're still sitting at the children's table in a house.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.080]   Well, and you have to, Apple has to prove it and launch it.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.440]   I'm sure they'll have stuff in the launch store, but was it all going to be like EA games,
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.040]   the big guys and not so much the little guys?
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.520]   Well, I don't think so.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.520]   Well, it's hard to tell.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.560]   Again, is this a gut chest?
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.280]   No, no, I guess.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.840]   There are people that I know that are not EA, not big, that have already been approved.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.640]   So I know for sure.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.600]   And they are people who haven't done a lot of programming in the past, even.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.240]   They don't have anything that they've done in the past that would tell you that they're
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.320]   a programmer, that they've done programming, but they're not, they don't have any big track
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   record or anything else.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.240]   They've been approved to at least develop the stuff and put it in.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.880]   Obviously, it's still going to have to go through the process of Apple looking at it.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.000]   But like podcasts, I don't think it's an Apple's best interest.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.520]   And obviously, I think they're going to try to make sure that it's not going to mess
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.520]   with the phone.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.520]   I think that's the big thing.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.520]   Well, I understand that.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520]   I mean, the phone's got to work.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520]   That's job one.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.080]   Ed Big does say the sound quality on the speakerphone is better than before.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.080]   Thank goodness.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.800]   I was able to listen to audio books, but that's about it.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   Not music.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   You wouldn't want to look at it.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   But I didn't find it particularly useful.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.120]   If it's spoken word, it sounded okay to me.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.000]   He says it's still not as good as headphones, obviously, but it has a good version.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.240]   I found it difficult to even listen if you're anywhere where there's any kind of noise.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   It's not very loud.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.240]   Listen to a voice mail or something.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   It's useless.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.720]   You know what I did is I used to cut my, I cut my hand behind it so that I built a little
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.280]   speaker amplifier, speaker directional thing.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.280]   Right.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.280]   And so I'm right.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.760]   I force all the sound to come right towards me, which pretty well turns into turns into
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.760]   turns into turns or on the original.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.160]   You see, it might have been uninstructible.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.440]   Somebody, this is really stupid and awesome.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.840]   Somebody took a toilet paper tube and if you squeeze a toilet paper tube until it's almost
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.160]   flat, it's just right.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.360]   It perfectly fits over.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.680]   And you can make this little like kind of old-timey trumpet like amplifier so you can listen to
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.440]   the iPhone when you're in the shower.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.120]   There's a magazine, an article waiting.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   I'm sure you're waiting to be rid of this.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.840]   I think important though that you put Macaroni, glue Macaroni, maybe a little gold paint on it.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   Definitely.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840]   Can you attach a camera?
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.760]   It's been making a real big project.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.640]   They're shipped just by camera, some LEDs.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.720]   And really you should break the warranty if you can.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.280]   If you're doing it, the warranty should break absolutely.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.560]   And then you post it on a site in like 11 steps over 12 pages.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.960]   And the new iPhone will have two little screws down there so you might be able to build a
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.960]   whole bracket right there.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.960]   That'd be kind of cool.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.360]   You can paint it brass and it could be steam pump.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.680]   Unfortunately, the camera, they say the camera isn't any better than it was before.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.880]   It's still two megapixels.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.920]   Still looks like I took it with Vaseline and Rob Dohler over the front of it.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   It was a little blue too.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   I just do it for reference.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.000]   I mean, if I'm just trying to remember a book or a place or whatever, that's all.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.480]   I see people like actually taking pictures that are going to put up on the web with the
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.480]   iPhone.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.040]   I'm kind of like, I wouldn't really do that.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:32.400]   No, it just like the trio in the sense of there will be two just slightly different lighting
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.560]   conditions and the hugest difference in the world and the quality of the photo.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.600]   I've got some where people are like, I think there's no way you took that with an iPhone.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.520]   It does depend, doesn't it?
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.520]   I've seen some amazing pictures.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.640]   I haven't had it with the trio where there's something I would take to just be exquisite
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.320]   and everything else look like.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.320]   It's just chance.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   I don't know.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.560]   There's some magic thing that happens.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.720]   There is, I wonder if Evernote will work with the iPhone because you know they have that
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   recognition.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.400]   If you take a picture, it'd be really cool if it were.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   He's right now.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   You just email it.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   He just emailed it to Evernote.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.400]   See, that's kind of cool.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.600]   So then you could take pictures of something and have Evernote recognize the text in it.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.360]   But the email is still low res.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.320]   I think it probably will be even on the new one.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   It's really weird.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.320]   Oh, that's right.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   The phone down samples the pictures.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.920]   There are way that now that was another good reason to app hack it.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.320]   I have the app that actually mails it at full.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.560]   It's nice to upload it to Flickr.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560]   It's a life flicker.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   I think it's cool.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.560]   That was nice.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.560]   That was very cool.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.560]   Will you, Randall, will you immediately crack your phone?
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.000]   Well, I'm going to, that's the other reason I'm going to wait on the new phone is to wait
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.400]   and see how long it'll take for them to get into it.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.800]   Randall will buy it when it's cracked.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   Yes.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.560]   I'll find for when it's on sale.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.840]   Randall gets online for when it's cracked.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.680]   Well, I've gotten so used to the things that I now have on it that I have to have that sort
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.920]   of level of replacement before it's interesting or the GPS has to completely trump everything
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.920]   else.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.920]   I'm not sure if it will yet.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   Right.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   My brother's just waiting to inherit my phone.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.920]   Is he?
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920]   He's just like, when are you going to get it?
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   Are you going to get it on Friday?
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   I don't want that.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.920]   I don't want that.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   I want the old one.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   She doesn't want one.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   She doesn't want it.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.920]   I think the old one is still good.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   The old one is still pretty good.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.920]   It's better now.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.920]   Yes.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.920]   All right.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.920]   I turned it back on.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   That's good, yes.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.920]   Sounds like the ocean's in the background.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   It is.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   If it was like a shush sound, that'd be kind of nice.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.920]   Yes.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.920]   We needed to like set that up.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.920]   Yeah, that'd be cool.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:26.400]   So one of the big pain points on the iPhone was in Canada where Rogers announced the most
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.360]   stupid plans in history.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.360]   I mean, I think they confusing stupid.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.600]   You could come up with many, many bad names for it.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:41.000]   But I think one of the big problems was it, I think the $30 plan had a $400 megabyte limit,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   something like that.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   It was just really sad.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   So they've backed down.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.600]   I mean, there were websites that were upset.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.400]   We talked about this last week about it and so forth.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.560]   They've backed down.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.240]   They're going to offer a six gigabyte data plan for 30 bucks per month.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.920]   However, and we don't know what this means, limited time promotional price.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.400]   I don't know if that means that the price goes up on your plan or if you get that plan
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.480]   plan, right now you get to keep it for the three years they're requiring, three years
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.560]   they're requiring your join.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.560]   Let's see.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.600]   A limited time promotional offer for customers who activate by August 31st on a three year
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:20.440]   contract, a data only offering of six gigabytes of data for $30 a month.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.440]   That's pretty good.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.120]   How much does six gig really work out to six gigs?
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.120]   Six gigs a lot.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.920]   In fact, you know, it's a type of 3G and everything.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:32.760]   I mean, if you download more, I think it's a lot of the life on my Verizon USB, you know,
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.440]   the VVDO card five gigs is the monthly limit.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.440]   Yeah, you never hit it.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440]   Yeah, I've never hit it.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.440]   Although I might have hit it.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   I did.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.440]   Yeah, I used to be Verizon.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.440]   I hit the limit.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.720]   They dropped me some on Sprint now.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.120]   Sprint still has that limit as well.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.440]   No, no, they say not.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.240]   But if you look at the fine print now, they put it in.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.640]   I have sucked down probably 20 gig in one month.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.880]   Because that's the other thing is do you do they enforce it?
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.520]   Is the other is the other question?
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.520]   They might.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.000]   And who know, you know, I think Rogers will enforce it.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.520]   Well, my Sprint card though, working well.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:11.280]   So they're saying you could visit 35,952 web pages or send and receive 157,286 emails.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.400]   These numbers are so stupid.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.240]   But they probably scaled it to really tiny things.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.240]   Well, yeah.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.240]   How big is email?
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.600]   Like hitting the front page of Google or something.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.400]   Probably not hitting the front page of your favorite heavy site.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.040]   Or you could watch 6,292 minutes of YouTube videos each and every month.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.200]   Or you could reload on Twitter until it works.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.440]   How many people should have said that?
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.840]   How many Twitter reloads is that?
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.280]   I don't think they would want to make an offer like that.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.520]   That's a lot of bandwidth.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   That's a lot of reloading.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.520]   You could see the scale well 8,000 times.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.080]   How many fail wells?
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   Right, exactly.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   Mmm.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.080]   Mmm.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   All right.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.280]   Should I cut that down from my stock photo?
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.360]   Supposedly, you know, it was a nice stock photo image.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.520]   And I think someone might have bought it exclusively.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.520]   Oh, that's too bad.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.560]   But you could-- so you mean-- did Twitter put that up?
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.880]   We're talking about that whale with the birds carrying it that you see.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.080]   I kind of sometimes do now and sometimes not.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.760]   I think they've other fail scale images.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.760]   Right.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   But so did Twitter put that on the iStock photo?
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.760]   No, no.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.240]   They bought it off iStock photo.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.680]   Twitter got it from iStock photo.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   Right.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   I could make sure it's of it and stuff.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.120]   Yeah, because there was that an Etsy bag that I really wanted.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.920]   Somebody made these beautiful canvas bags with--
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.240]   Oh, it made sculptures out of it.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   People have made all kinds of amazing stuff.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.120]   Yeah, there's a full sculpture.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.840]   You know, the only thing that does anybody pointed this out before?
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.160]   The whale-- the birds carrying the whale are flying in different directions.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.480]   They're trying to hold it up.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   They're not trying to move the whale.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.560]   They actually can't move it the way they're doing it.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.800]   They're flying in different directions.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   I think that really points to a larger problem.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.040]   This is the kind of conversations I would have when I was really high in college.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.160]   Do you notice the birds are literally serious?
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.960]   They're moving in different directions.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   Why?
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.960]   You say high or high?
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   In different ways, dude.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.520]   That would never work.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.760]   All right, well, I noticed it.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   Maybe I was high.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.760]   I don't know.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.320]   I noticed it.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   But both the-- you know, I have to say both Ed Begg's review and Walt Mossberger's review
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.880]   look awful like the reviews of the original iPhone.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.120]   Kind of yes but reviews.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   We love it.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.120]   It's great.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.120]   It's a revolution.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   It's going to be so good.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.240]   There are a few things not to like about it, but you're going to love it.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.240]   It's great.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   It's a revolution.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   It's changing everything.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.680]   I'll see if David Pogue has a review yet in the New York Times.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.480]   I imagine he does.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   He does.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.640]   Is this out?
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   Yep.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.000]   I'm looking for it right now.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.120]   Would you like something to drink, young man?
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   Yes.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.120]   Dain!
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   One of the lackeys please.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.120]   Lean!
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.120]   It's common like that.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.920]   You know, you could just take the earpiece off and go wander out.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.720]   There's water and there's a-- you can have some brain ton I'd like.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   I'm going to get some more.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.280]   I have some wine if you'd prefer.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.720]   No, no, I'm definitely.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.280]   With this door closed now, they don't know if we're suffering in here or not.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.280]   It could be--
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   A brain tonic.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   A couple of brain tonics.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.080]   Mr. Mann, would you like a brain tonic?
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.080]   It's going to get a brain tonic.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   They sent me some of those brain tonics.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.080]   How am I trying one of them?
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.080]   You know, I should send you a case.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   I'll get a case sent out to you.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   No, no, they sent me a huge ass box.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   I've got like 400 of them.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   Oh, you're kidding?
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   Oh, good.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   It was nice of them.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.160]   I thought for a while they were giving me the trots, but I'm not sure.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.160]   I think I'm--
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.000]   I can vouch for the fact that they're not.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   They don't give you the trots, you sure?
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   I am positive.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   I have consumed more brain tonic than any human alive.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I asked Dane, if I asked Dane, is he going to say you're spending a lot of time in the bathroom?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   He's going to tell you the truth.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   He's going to say no more than usual.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Fair enough.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   No more than usual.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   I'm going to go get a brain tonic.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I'll be right back.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   OK, good.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Brain tonic break.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Brain tonic break, right?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   You know, they're not really an advertiser, but we do have a deal that if you go to braintonic.com,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.360]   and use Leo as the coupon code, you get 20% off, and then I think we get like 15% or something
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.360]   like that.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.760]   So we get a little money.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.360]   You save more than we make, but that's good.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.360]   And these are delicious, aren't they?
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.280]   They have-- they're sweetened with a gave nectar.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.280]   There's no sugar.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.280]   They're tasty.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.280]   And there's no stimulants.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.280]   There's no caffeine.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.280]   I'm sorry, Randall.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.160]   A gave nectar is what they make to the kilo out of.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.800]   I like how he said that.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.560]   Are they a sponsor, or are you just being nice to mention them?
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.840]   Well, that's the deal right there.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.720]   They're not really a sponsor, but they give us--
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.640]   So it's like a 30-rock thing.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.720]   We just kind of mentioned them like Snapple.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.640]   I kind of-- you know, the whole reason I started doing it-- first of all, he called me up and
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.440]   said we want to buy ad time.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.040]   And I said, well, you got to set it to me first, and if I like it, we'll talk about it.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.480]   And I don't think you can afford ad time, but it's expensive to buy ads on this stuff.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   But--
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.240]   Hey, you guys, I'm sure real quick I'm doing a crossword puzzle, and I need a 10-letter
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.360]   word that rhymes with crane-fronic.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.040]   Does it end with a Q?
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.040]   It could.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.200]   You know what it does.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.200]   It does.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.200]   It's amazing.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.200]   Wow.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.200]   There's not any words that end with a Q.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.000]   The clue is the clue is delicious of viral drink rhymes with schmonic.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.760]   Rhymes with schmonic.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.520]   You know, the cool thing is that they've actually sold a lot of brain tonic, because
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.520]   I just thought it'd be kind of fun to-- you know, I wanted to demonstrate the product placement
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.840]   works, right?
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.440]   So I just thought it'd be kind of fun to have product placement.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.080]   Oh, gosh, that's weird.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.360]   I didn't know about-- see, if I'd known about that, I probably-- I don't know if I would
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.360]   have mentioned it.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.680]   But-- hey, you guys ever noticed how hard it is to find an effective protease inhibitor?
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.520]   Not in the tasty, carbonated beverage, anyway.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.520]   Hey, you guys.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.080]   Are you guys ever worried about what kind of statin you're taking?
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.200]   Well, I'm just saying, Leo, it'd be kind of funny.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.400]   It'd be kind of funny if you got approached, because we've just started watching a little
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.840]   bit of workable TV to watch reality shows on Bravo.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.840]   Well, who should I get?
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.840]   Blood pressure medicine?
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   Are you saying that?
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.840]   I mean--
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.840]   Is this something we talk about a lot on our program?
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.840]   We're trying to find different revenue streams.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:54.200]   And I think really looking into the whole medical pharmaceutical industry, I think that's
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   the deep pockets.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.200]   Big pharma.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.240]   The problem is that half of the show then becomes the disclaimer.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.600]   That would be funny.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.640]   We could do it in like a song about it or something.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:12.240]   And it'll cause you to have anal leakage and a little thin.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.240]   Sausage fingers.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.240]   It's the doctor.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.520]   Anyway, I'm just saying, because I'm a cable man, those guys are making some serious bank
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]   off of pharmaceuticals.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:25.640]   There's no reason you can do go viral on some kind of quarterly birth control problem.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.600]   I think brain tonic is a-- what do they call it?
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   It's a beverage-suticle.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.400]   Are you talking about brain tonic?
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.400]   The clean and intelligent drink?
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   Yes.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.400]   That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.400]   One that's made by TrueTonics.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.400]   TrueTonics?
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.400]   That's the one.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   B-R-A-I-N-T-O-N-I-Q.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.400]   So much for the old false tonics company.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.400]   Yeah, try to remember.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.760]   I remember there was one delicious energy providing drink that has organic agave nectar,
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.240]   and I couldn't remember which one it is.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.800]   Now we're eating chocolate.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.560]   This is now time for a chocolate break.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   Hellen chocolate.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.560]   What is-- explain this chocolate.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.560]   This is really good.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.120]   It's never been above 125 degrees, so it's got all the original antioxidants in it.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.120]   There's no milk.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.120]   There's no sugar in it.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.440]   It's actually sweetened with a little bit of blueberry, which is that extra.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.440]   Really good.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.440]   And what's this called?
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.440]   It's called Soshai.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   Soshosai.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.440]   X-O-S.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.440]   X-O-C-A-I.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:19.840]   If you go to exochocolates.com, you'll get more details about it.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.120]   Can I inject a Mac thing?
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.120]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.120]   This is happening with rats or holes.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.360]   I'm curious, but we're going to think of this.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:34.320]   Did you guys see the story about the guy, the Mac developer, who according to his blog
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:40.960]   post, Apple gave out his Apple ID password when somebody asked for it.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.960]   Did you guys see the story?
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.360]   Yeah, they just asked for it.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.080]   I don't know every detail of the story.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.160]   I read his blog entry like anybody else.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.160]   He's an Apple developer.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.680]   He's got an Apple developer account.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:59.120]   Apparently, somebody using what appears to be the developer.apple.com/contactpage according
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:04.280]   to what he says here, contacted Apple with his Apple ID and they reset the password.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.440]   He's so from his Yahoo.com email address.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.800]   I hope people don't hear about this and do it because that's really scary.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   I mean, that's...
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.200]   So this guy said he says he says he's emails...
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.040]   It's kind of social engineering, but it wasn't very hard.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.920]   Well I would hope that this is true and some people say they think it might not be, but
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.360]   I have no reason not to think it's true.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.080]   I would hope that this would just really super harden the kind of training they give
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.440]   folks about giving that kind of information out.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.440]   Wow.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.600]   So that developer in Helsinki, his name is Marco Carpenen and his Mac ID is...
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.440]   Oh no, I should stop right there.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.440]   And it's credit card.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.560]   I know Randall is a student and a teacher of this stuff.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.640]   So I'm just curious, does this sound like basic the kind of myth-nic social engineering
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   side of hacking?
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.360]   It's very simple, straightforward social engineering.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   Yeah, and it means that the frontline support person at Apple was doing the wrong thing and
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.920]   they should be retrained.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.760]   And they're going to be sent from Bangalore to Mumbai.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.760]   No.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.320]   The question is, did they ask the security question?
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.200]   I mean, we don't know exactly what happened.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.160]   I'm sure, in fact, we should try it.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.120]   I'm sure if you call Apple and say I've forgotten my dot Mac password, they have a process.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.760]   We should try it from international waters.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.760]   Why so?
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.040]   Because that's fraud, essentially.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.360]   You're going to commit fraud and talk about it.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   Oh, you know a little bit of this.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.560]   I know a little bit about the law and these kinds of things.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.560]   I forgot.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   So now let's say, let's not do this.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.040]   You don't actually want to test security.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.400]   Unless you have their permission.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.400]   Without people's permission.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.400]   But I could do it on my own.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.800]   I could ask them for my own dot Mac.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.040]   I could say, hey, I've forgotten my dot Mac password.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.080]   You see how much you have to give them together.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.800]   Yeah, that's absolutely cool, right?
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   That's my own thing.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   I'll take this as one example where I'm not, you know, that guy who's obsessed with this
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.680]   transparency stuff like some folks are, but this is really where it would be nice for
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.200]   Apple to, even in the way that Google has reached out with blogs, this would be a great
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.600]   opportunity for somebody at Apple to, with a certain amount of authority and permission,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.800]   stand up and say, hey, well, here's what happened.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.840]   Either here's what went wrong or here's where the facts are right or wrong.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.600]   But like, you know, a lot of us are relying on them to do this stuff right.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.160]   And I think when something like this comes out, it'd be great for them to have a non-PR
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.400]   based reaction that just speaks directly to people.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.080]   It says, hey, here's what really happened.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.320]   Because this freaks me out.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.640]   I think this is kind of messed up.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.400]   I think that I don't see Apple do that very often.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.440]   Well, and we don't know exactly what the...
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.560]   Well, yeah, and I certainly am not trying to say the Marcos at the gentleman's name.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.000]   I'm not trying to say what he's saying is incorrect or false or anything.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.280]   It's just that it's a lot.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.880]   So it's a big, it's a big tuner to be out there.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.280]   And I would love to hear Apple respond to this.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.440]   It is a great opportunity for Apple to actually use it to develop their relationship.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.520]   It's actually given where they're headed with this.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.400]   If they're going to become, you know, the curator of our digital life, we're going to
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.000]   have to trust them with an extraordinary amount.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.880]   It's a reason a lot of folks maybe randal type folks.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.520]   There's a lot of folks out there who say, hey, look, I encrypt everything.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.240]   I run it on my own server.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.440]   It's, you know, everything end to end.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.320]   Everything is encrypted and I handle everything myself.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.600]   And we give a lot of that away for the convenience of something like .Mac and I disk.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.240]   And I think you would be great for them to step up and say what's going on here.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.000]   Supposedly Mobile Me is launching in the next day or so.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.760]   And that'll be interesting to see if they change the policies that it's supposed to
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.760]   go live.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.760]   It's supposed to go live today.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.760]   And hopefully it'll be solid.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.600]   I mean, the big thing has been over the last couple of weeks as they've been making the
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.760]   switch.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.600]   There's been lots of outages for .Mac.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.600]   Oh, really?
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.000]   I mean, so they've been, I think it's just been the switchover has not been totally.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.960]   It's been slightly Twitter-like.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:51.720]   I have, I will tell you, I ordinarily I'm Mr. .Mac outage, but I have not been experiencing
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.720]   that.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:38:00.840]   I have to admit that I had some .Mac outages early on when .Mac came out and I have to
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.760]   admit it was that that was, I don't use my .Mac mail that often because of it.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.720]   You know, it was just, I was like, oh, I can't depend on this.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.120]   Yeah, once you get burned, it's a little tough for that.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.120]   And then I was just like, I was gone.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.120]   It's just trust me.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.120]   I still use it.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.120]   I still pay for .Mac.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.080]   I still use the other features of .Mac.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.240]   I just don't happen to use my mail.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.600]   I mean, my mail is, I get it, but it's a.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.520]   Yeah, I don't use, I don't use the mail at all.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   I mean, yeah.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.320]   That was, it was kind of like, you know, I didn't want to be deterred in the punch ball.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.040]   Everybody was all excited about the mobile mean push stuff.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.040]   Well, yeah, it's going to push your mobile game.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.040]   I'm not going to push it.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.400]   I think Andy and I could just join us in his Tesla.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   Hello, Andy.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   Hello.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.680]   I just, I just, I just been, I've just been keeping quiet because I got an emo from somebody
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.680]   who says I talked too much during these things.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.400]   Oh, so just sit there quietly and we'll continue on without you.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.720]   No, no, like the, like the little church mouse.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.680]   Who said you're talking too much?
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   Yeah, I don't buy it.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.600]   Who just mounts along with the hymns and doesn't sing along with the rest of the mice.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   That's exactly right.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   No, it's good to have you in.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.160]   Andy, we've been talking about the phone.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:03.040]   You're not one of the, the, the magic for the four horsemen of the iPhone who received
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.240]   an iPhone for review.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.920]   Can you reveal that at this point?
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:12.720]   Well, I can reveal that I am on double secret iPhone review, which is a special classification
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.320]   above Walt Mossberg above David Fode.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   It just makes me mad.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   Ed Begg.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:24.160]   No, no, no, I mean, if, if, if honestly, I mean, someone, someone told me about this
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.600]   earlier today and I had to tell them that, well, you know what, if I was going to get
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.400]   offended that like people got the iPhone before I do, that would mean that I could then, you
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.960]   know, it would be okay for me to feel superior to people who are not getting the iPhone at
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.440]   all or getting it after me.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.000]   And that's, that's just plain wrong.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.800]   It's not a, it's not a beauty contest.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.360]   Well, in any event, we've been looking at the reviews, we've gone through them.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.760]   And now we're talking about mobile me, the fact that Apple says it will come out tonight,
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.760]   6 p.m. Pacific.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.440]   I wonder if anybody's camping out for that.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.200]   I'm going to get a line.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.440]   My question is though, and that may be my memories failing here, but when we say mobile
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:05.800]   me is coming out, excluding all the push stuff in on the iPhone, remind me what the mobile
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.360]   me stuff is that would be coming out.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.600]   Yeah, what would look different?
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.800]   Well, yeah, below.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   Now, do we, do we have to go to me.com?
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.400]   No, you can, you're old.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.760]   You actually, it's supposedly the, I hear tell that the me.com address has already worked,
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.360]   but I believe your Mac.com address will continue to work.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.360]   That's what I figured.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:27.120]   I really have no interest in having people send stuff to at me.com.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   I want, I want I.org.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.800]   I'm early in that work.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   What's the objective?
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.200]   I don't want, I don't want the, I don't want the objective.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   I want the subject.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   I got it.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   But I really wanted to be me, me, me.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.600]   I want to see if talk dirty is now taken.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.880]   If I can just say, you know, what's talking in touch with the XO?
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.920]   Just talk dirty at me.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.640]   Or me, I want me.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.320]   Talk dirty at me.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.320]   I like it.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   Or mini at me.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   Mini at me.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.560]   You can, I could have stopped yelling at me.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.520]   Oh, I think there's some good news.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.520]   Okay.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.520]   Okay.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   Maybe I'll have to think about it.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   Quickly for these here.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.520]   Take another look at me.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.520]   Look at me.com.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.520]   Mobile me at me.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.040]   Look at me.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   I like it.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.040]   Look at me.com.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.040]   Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.240]   Those are probably all gone though.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.240]   Sure.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.240]   We're both.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   Sure.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   How do you get those?
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.880]   You guys are determined not to talk about Max today.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.880]   No, this is Max.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.880]   This is Max.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.640]   This is Max stuff.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.640]   Mobile mini me.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.880]   How about the new power books?
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.880]   Are y'all excited?
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.040]   Are there gonna be new power books?
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.480]   How soon when?
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.040]   We've seen pictures all over the place on the net.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.840]   Again, these, you know, faked Mac books.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.520]   Yeah, did I say PowerBook?
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.000]   I am such a throwback.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.040]   No, no, they keep changing the world on us.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.360]   They think it's funny, I think.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.680]   I'm gonna search for Mac books.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   And then maybe I'll find some pictures of Mac books.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.680]   Sorry, I keep on my--
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   Sorry, I keep on my--
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   Oh, you know what?
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   I take it back so there will be the web application stuff.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.160]   Of course, the new version of their app.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.400]   Yeah, you'll get the mail.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.800]   Well, it sounds like Apple with the Sproutcore type stuff that they intend to turn the--
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.800]   You get the photos.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   --that's the solution way up.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:15.600]   I'm gonna see a lot of really, really interesting things as they really start to do Ajax-like
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.480]   solutions with much of their web services.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.600]   I'm waiting for the MacBook Air to come down in price.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.600]   I would like that.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.600]   Yes.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   I really like that.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.920]   I love a MacBook Air.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.200]   You know, last week I went off the call when--
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.400]   Can I do this just a very quick--
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.400]   You had a Colonel Panic.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.400]   You had a Colonel Panic.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.960]   Oh my God, I had the Colonel Panic from hell.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.960]   Oh.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.440]   And it was just-- it was one of those where it was just-- at first it was just happening
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.320]   often enough to be like a little inconvenient, but I figured, okay, no big deal.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.760]   Something, you know, and I did all the usual chicken waving.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.120]   I did all the-- I did the clean reinstall.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.120]   I did a backup.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.400]   I did this-- and then of course that was the last straw when that happened.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:56.160]   So I ended up taking it in and I just would like to give, for no reason other than they
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.280]   were really super nice to me.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   The geniuses at the Stonestown Mall, Apple Store were fantastic.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.360]   And they were incredibly helpful and smart and helped me out.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.960]   And basically what's awesome, this guy Max, who was a genius there, helped me like-- he
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.080]   gave me the most awesome like inside thing where he was like, well, you know, I could
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.480]   take this and like hold it for six days and like maybe we'd look at it or-- like here's
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.360]   some suggestions you could go and try at home and if that doesn't work, bring it back.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.200]   And in the meantime, we think it's your video card.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.200]   I'm going to order you a video card.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   Anyway--
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   Oh, that's great.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   Wow.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.200]   No, it was total.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   Like, so I take back everything-- almost everything.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.120]   I've said-- because I have had bad genius experiences, but this one was so good and I
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.640]   hope anybody who's in a position to congratulate Max, Chris, Mary, and Emily at the Apple
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.040]   Store, they were super nice to me and very professional.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.040]   Oh, that's great.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.840]   And I sat there and watched them just deal with people and like this woman, this like
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.480]   you could tell there's like people who come in like three times a week, you know, they
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.400]   bring their eye back in over and over.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.440]   And this woman's like, I don't understand, I've lost my internet, you know?
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.920]   And her doc consists of IE and the Trash.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.560]   And they were incredibly nice to all these people.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.320]   So I just wanted to say A, like thank you to the Stonestown Apple Store people because
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.880]   they were-- they rocked and they helped me out.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.880]   And now I'm back up on that.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.840]   Yeah, I've been trying to-- I have grown to have the opinion in-- when I went into the
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:12.160]   Apple Store yesterday, I'm trying to persuade my wife, Carlita, to get an air.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.320]   I think the air is the one that she would be the most happy with because she's got a
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.120]   baby and she's traveling around and it'd be just light.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.160]   And we wanted to look at it one.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.840]   And there's just a bunch of, you know, there's a bunch of tourists who are checking their
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.840]   Google mail and doing Google Maps and trying to figure out where they are.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.840]   It's like an office.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840]   It's like a tourist office.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.280]   I really think that the ones downstairs-- I've kind of grown to believe that the computers
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.520]   downstairs should not be connected to the internet.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:41.000]   You know, they should-- because we're there to buy a computer and all she wanted to do
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.600]   is walk up to an air and pick it up.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.880]   And what's amazing is is that people are pretty-- you know, what I do is I pretty much
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.600]   uncomfortably stand right behind somebody and just look over their shoulder at their
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.600]   mail.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.840]   And usually that's enough to get someone to go-- they'll look over their shoulder and
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:56.840]   leave over.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.840]   I'm just waiting to look at that Mac.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:03.720]   So, you know, I'm going to keep on looking at it and I'll read whatever you got on there
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:04.960]   until you get out of my way.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.760]   You know, you should say thank you for the demo.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.400]   Yeah, so I'm just watching your demo.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.160]   That's pretty good that you can get your mail like that.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   That's pretty cool.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.600]   I just-- I've gotten kind of-- why don't you reply to that night and tell them--
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.040]   Because I bring people over-- it's 100 feet from our office.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.680]   And so I bring people over to show the Macs, especially people who I'm trying to sell
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   them and I can never get one.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.800]   So now I've just gotten to the point where I get pretty much a bruise on it.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.080]   But they have to be connected though because really, I mean, half the value of a Mac is
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.080]   being online.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.840]   And it's going to be tough if you're trying to sell it without it.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.920]   If you just block it to Google and Yahoo, it would cut most of it out.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.560]   Except that's going to be old people or familiar with what they're going to want to do.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.560]   But I just-- I know.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.560]   I know.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   I know.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   That's crazy.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   I'm just going to say it's the Mac Pro thing though.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   Having that back, it's great.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.560]   I do Skype on that.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   It's so awesome.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560]   But you know what?
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.480]   Since I got that MacBook Air, I never in a million Airs would have predicted this.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.400]   That has become my primary machine now.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.760]   And although I must tell you, I am suffering mightily under the core shutdown issue.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   That most people are suffering from.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.800]   When it goes to sleep, it goes out.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   No.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.400]   When it gets too hot, a core shutdown completely goes to 100% usage and based on what's working.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.960]   So you have to reboot or cool off?
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.960]   Like if you're using it, yeah.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.480]   If you're using it like, in my case, I set it on the Audubon, sometimes when I'm typing.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.800]   And it just gets too hot then.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.120]   And it goes, you watch the first processor is all red and green solid to the top.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   Right.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.120]   But you know what?
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.120]   It's amazing to me.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   So the funny part, and then the part of the reasoning in this very long story, is that
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:27.720]   like while I couldn't use my Mac Pro as a tower, I could still use it in, you know,
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.320]   firewire target mode with my mini.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.680]   And oh man, it was it was unbelievable.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.600]   The MacBook Air fair enough to gigs of RAM versus Mac mini with one bigger RAM.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   It flew.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.080]   The MacBook Air blew it out of the water.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.080]   Really?
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.080]   I mean, performance.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   The MacBook Air feels very.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.080]   It's not.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.040]   Well, it's funny because I was one of the folks who was going, oh yeah, like this is
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.040]   going to be like a toy.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.040]   It's totally underpowered.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.120]   But man, I can really recommend that.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.640]   Computer to people at this point.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   Cool.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.240]   Now, I thought I'm not hurting for not having fire fire.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.040]   It sucks when you want to do a backup because it would be nice to have firewire for backups.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.040]   But you know what?
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.240]   Hang it on a time machine and it does it through the air at night.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.240]   For me, I had it for about a month and a half on loan.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:18.480]   And it was a week in Denver with a digital SLR that convinced me that as much as I like
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.800]   the air, it could never be one that I would actually buy because with a 60 gig hard drive,
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:28.120]   the difficulty of dumping four gigs worth of photos onto the hard drive and then burning
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.480]   them onto DVD to get them off the hard drive or put on the local hard drive and plug in
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.400]   your external hard drive to get them off.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.640]   The idea of getting all this, acquiring all this new content every day when you're on
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.760]   a trip and then somehow manage working it so that you don't, it doesn't land on your
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.240]   internal, you manage to get it onto a DVD or an external drive was just so much hassle
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.720]   that I was glad that I was glad that this was another one of those two MacBook, MacBook
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.720]   trips for me.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.680]   I was always using the Black MacBook for all the real stuff.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:48:00.760]   We're getting a number of very good mobile me email addresses from Mark Chatham.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.560]   Rob suggests all she does is talk at me.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.080]   Then throw your money at me.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:10.040]   Talk to the hand not at me.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.880]   Go away and stop bugging me at me.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.040]   I think there'd be some fun ones in here.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.880]   I think we should quickly register those before it's set to.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.440]   Is it going to be like the California license plate division where they say no, that spells
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.400]   out something naughty people not let you?
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.400]   That's dirty.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   You know what?
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.080]   We're in the review mirror that means touch my butt.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.200]   You're not going to prove this one.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.280]   Mr. Clever Pants.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.560]   I have to say Merlin, I was also, I don't have an air but I got one for my daughter
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.000]   to take to France with her as she's gone in September for a year.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.800]   And I have to say I'm eyeing it.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   And I had the more, the more.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.680]   I hear what Andy's saying though.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.680]   I mean part of it is.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.680]   Well tell you how.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.680]   Well here's the thing.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.800]   For my friends, you look nice today guys came up and we did a bunch of stuff in the
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.800]   city.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.800]   Lonely sandwich and scott Simpson.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.560]   You guys actually hung out?
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.800]   Oh yeah, we did a lot of shit.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   Anyway, let's start it short.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.760]   They use their iPhones like computers.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.920]   They don't keep your laptops.
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.440]   They do everything on their iPhones.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.520]   And I mean so I watched them though for a couple of days in the SMSing and it's like they're
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.200]   you know 15 year old kids to watch these guys use these.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.560]   And whereas I'm totally like an old man like where do I work?
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:27.800]   And so what I'm saying is like I really, I'm starting to really understand how you're
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.520]   thinking and your behavior adapts when a couple of things are in place.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.120]   And one is that like that's something yes be very, very good at the tasks that is very
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.600]   important you be able to do.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.000]   But second that let's be honest in a first world way that it'd be part of a larger system
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.320]   of how it all works together.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.320]   So I agree with Andy.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.560]   Like if I was just going to travel and tried to have my entire photo selection collection
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:49.320]   or iTunes on a MacBook Air it would not work.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.200]   I mean I don't have any, I was just going to say that just to mention the thought is
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:57.480]   that like so in my household like that's I've got a media server that I put that stuff
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.000]   on and I do all my photos at my desk.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.520]   So like it is it's kind of a different use case but I you know and the funny part is
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.440]   this week having my computer go completely down my main computer.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:12.120]   I was like wow I really missed the days when I was just on my MacBook bro.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:14.760]   Like my life was so much simpler you know.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.800]   But anyway I think it's about adjusting patterns too.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.200]   Well if you're a photographer like Andy is it's not going to be a good choice for you
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.400]   you're going to want a bigger hard drive.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.560]   I mean that's just the way it is.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.720]   Yeah well it's not even a case of wanting to keep any sort of a large music library or
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.920]   a large photo library on there.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:37.200]   It's again once you or at least once I put in the core not the minimum suite of applications
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.240]   that I need but a comfortable array that makes it worth you know spending $1800 bucks
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.040]   $2000 for a computer and having these applications around.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.480]   And I have just the small amount of podcasts I'm downloading because I'm going to be synchronizing
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.360]   to my iPod on the road.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:54.800]   I have you wind up with that it's like a sliding tiles puzzle where there's that one
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.920]   empty slot that you need in order to move everything around to basically make everything
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:03.600]   work with the MacBook Air by the time you put in the core minimum of the stuff you need
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.480]   on a day to day basis especially when you're out for a week.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.280]   You're left with a pretty small footprint and for some people even if you're not again
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.400]   keeping 40 gigs for the photos on there it can be kind of a tight fit and the fact that
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:21.080]   you don't have two USB ports to play with you'll have to carry an adapter with you that
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.280]   kind of you know that's something to consider.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.360]   It's not a deal breaker but it's definitely something to consider.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:31.720]   Andy I'm right there with you too because I have 160 gigs on my MacBook Pro and even
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:36.200]   just putting the application suite and a bunch of other stuff on there it's mostly full again.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:41.080]   I mean I don't know why I don't know why I have 250 I have a 250 gig and I struggle
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.760]   to keep you know five to ten gigs open all right.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:48.520]   But I think but it's how you use it so if you say okay my early has 60 gigs I'm just
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:52.080]   not going to use it to put my music on I'm not going to use it to put my photos on.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.400]   This is my portable.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.400]   I think we don't have to.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.120]   We're all right I think we're potentially we're all right.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:57.120]   You're all right.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:59.640]   No no only because like 60 gigs is.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   Jimmy frickin Carter.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   60 gigs.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   All right let's all start in.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.280]   Like inexcusably small.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.000]   It's ridiculously small.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.560]   But I mean if it were 100 gigs like I think there should be a way that you can live with
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.920]   100 gigs unless you're editing video on a MacBook Air all the time.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.600]   I mean there's always should be a way if you've got a larger system in place that should
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.600]   not be untenable.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:24.960]   I mean yes you have to run parallels or something like you're going to be screwed but yeah.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:30.400]   I guess I guess the best way to put it is that on my EPC which costs 400 bucks it's
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.560]   okay that I don't have four gigs of storage at some point I have to say well look it's
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.680]   a 400 dollar machine really cute it's really tiny it's really useful.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.800]   Once you start once I start spending 1800 bucks on something I really don't like to have
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.320]   to say to have to say well of course I'm not going to put things that I want on it yes
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.280]   would be more useful if I did this yes I guess yes be more handy if I could run parallels
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.160]   but of course what do I expect for 1800 dollars.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.160]   That's kind of a difficult thing.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.160]   I mean the best the by hands down one of the most useful things I ever bought for any Macintosh
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.960]   I've ever owned was when my the internal drive on my MacBook got went fatal in January during
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:08.520]   Mackerel Expo and I immediately replaced it with a 320 gig drive because the Mac my MacBook
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.040]   is not the most it's not even a Macbook Pro but the fact that you know what I can dual
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.960]   boot it I don't have to worry about it I can not can have windows on here.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.520]   I'm just I'm just going to Leo's law that no matter how big your drive is two thirds
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.520]   of it will be full.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.520]   It's the law back.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.520]   It's the law back.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.520]   Yes.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.520]   The houses.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.520]   Yes.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:28.240]   So there is never enough really I mean it's it's never it's it's it's being like voruca
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.720]   salt no one ever says no to you when you have a 320 gig drive.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:36.080]   I mean you remember back in the early days of like my my powerbook 140 I think had a
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.080]   40 meg drive.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.080]   Oh yeah.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:43.680]   I mean when I got 122 megs on my 122 megs on my 2ci and people asked me what are you
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.880]   going to do with all that space.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.680]   I'm like I'm doing audio man.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.680]   I'm doing audio.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.240]   I'll fill that up in no time.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.680]   Hey just speaking of big drives like you saw the Drobo announcement they've gone firewire
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.240]   firewire 800 which is a good thing.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.920]   You know if you're going to go up you might as well all the way to the top.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.240]   This is huge push.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.000]   I believe the the model number on this is the STF you.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.320]   Is this in response to Drobo owners but you know okay the PC side everybody's doing
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.160]   ESATA now.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:18.960]   ESATA which is basically hooking it up to the bus practically.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.040]   And so now it firewire 800 as good as that sounds is still lagging a little bit.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.440]   Well depends on what on what kind of speeds you really you're really getting firewire
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:32.400]   800 I mean you can get up to 60 70 megs a second with the firewire 800 I mean it's
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.480]   capable of doing that.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.440]   I mean it's capable theoretically of 90 megs.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:40.080]   And all the current max have firewire 800 connectors right.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.560]   Exactly but I think that the MacBook.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:45.000]   But if you're throwing a bunch of hard drives in you're not doing a RAID 0 you're not going
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.720]   to get much more performance out of the out of the drives than what you're going to get
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.920]   out of 800 I would not plug it into the Drobo even an ESATA and expect to get much more
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.760]   data flow out of those four drives.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   Because the drives are maxed.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.760]   Because they're not built for performance.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:58.760]   Right.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   And they're built for backup.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.760]   Right.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.760]   And they're built for stability.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.760]   So.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.760]   Again that's how you're using it that makes a difference.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   Right.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.760]   Anyway that's good news I'm glad that they did it.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.760]   It is huge.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.560]   There's two things with the USB that's real pain in the neck because I got so I have a
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:16.000]   couple portable USB drives and I've grown to kind of hate them mostly because the USB.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   I just bought a USB 320 it said I should just send it back.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   I have a bunch of those.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   I have that's what I have I have like four of these.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   I have a much of a passport.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   I have a much of a passport.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   And so I have got a whole one.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   And I carry one or two with me all the time.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Right.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   And they're great drives.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   They're great little drives.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   The problem is is that they're both powered.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   So.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   And that's why I have them.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   And I'm doing kind of what Andy was complaining about.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.480]   I am virtualized.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.120]   All my big files are moving on to these.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.040]   I have two identical ones.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.040]   Yep.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.760]   And so that one goes bad but I just carry them around with me and I'm pulling stuff off
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.840]   my computer because I just don't have enough space.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.840]   And so.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:53.880]   But I got them and the problem is the USB also I started noticing it really impacts my when
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.480]   you're transferring something your whole everything else is busy.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:02.000]   You know, a firewire doesn't have that impact, you know, and and the USB requires the processor
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.240]   to do a lot of the work where as firewires appear to peer solution and doesn't need intelligence.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:11.720]   And so that's the real bummer about you is slows that all down and it's just horribly
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.720]   slow.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   Right.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.720]   You know, right.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:20.000]   I'm hearing in our chat room that iTunes 7.7 will be available in quote a few hours.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.160]   So I'm great at iTunes, which usually means, you know, we're going to make the copy protection
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.160]   work again.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:30.360]   But in this case, I think what it means probably is we're going to make a mobile me work and
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.600]   maybe the new iPhone work and it's going to have the app store, don't you think?
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.000]   Well, that'd be the app store.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.960]   iTunes needs to know how to do the hand shaking with the iPhone 2.0 for the security.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.240]   So it's probably the other thing that's being upgraded for.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:45.240]   I'm what the app store.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.600]   I mean, I think frankly, as far as I'm concerned, that's the big story here.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.880]   Not the iPhone 3G.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.880]   Who cares about three?
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.600]   Not who cares, but it's not 3G is not important to a lot of people.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:57.680]   GPS is crippled, but the app store could be huge.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:00.920]   I mean, the app store could be for the iPhone 2.0 software though, wouldn't that want to
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:02.840]   buy a hardware for that?
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:03.840]   Exactly.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:04.840]   Well, that's kind of what I'm saying.
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:08.920]   David Polk says that also in his review that, you know, there is one thing that both David
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:15.920]   and a Mollmossberger pointed out, Mossberg, I had an er, Merger, Mossberg pointed out
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.400]   is that the sound is better.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.040]   David even says the sound is better when you make calls.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:24.440]   He says one of the best sounding cell phones of all now.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:29.800]   But even he points out that really it's all about the app store and 2.0.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.920]   And you get that on an iPod touch for crying out like that.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.960]   You don't have to buy a new iPhone for that.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.640]   Before we do our picks in just a little bit, I just want to ask you, you've been using
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.640]   a red camera, Alex.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:45.080]   Yeah, we just shot last two days for a show that's going to be on PBS in November, a couple
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.080]   of days.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.360]   This is with that new 4K camera that nothing can play back the video of.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:50.440]   Well, right?
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.440]   If you shoot it in 4K?
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.840]   Yeah, nothing can really play the video back.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.160]   So it's so high resolution.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:58:00.600]   And the reality is that what it, what in our purposes, it, what it generally does is
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:05.520]   it gives us a really, really good 19 by 20, 19 20 by 1080 image.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:07.160]   And a standard HD image.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:11.320]   Yeah, a standard, because at 4K everything, you know, it looks, you know, you're dealing
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:16.280]   with the bear pattern and I don't find that the 4K image is really sharp as I've liked
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   the rest of it.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.560]   But when we bring it down to the 19 by 1080, that's the same as other cameras, but now
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.240]   we have a 4, 4, 4, you know, really, really high quality.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:27.200]   So it's better than the CineAlters that you spent so much money on?
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.400]   The images, yeah, yes.
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:30.840]   So yes, it is.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.440]   But CineAlter was, you know, it's, it's, you had a couple of years ago.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:35.800]   And we made a lot of money with it.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.800]   And so it was good.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   And paid for itself.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.320]   But I have to say that the red is a, it's a really, there's a lot of little things it
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.920]   does that are just, you know, really well thought out.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:47.920]   The first time we started doing testing, it was with version, you know, the software
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.040]   version changes all the time.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.920]   It's not, you know, these guys are constantly changing the firmware.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:57.200]   And so when I tested it at version 4 and 5, it was not something that I'd want to do
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.800]   work with.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:03.160]   But now it's up to version 15 in the last, you know, six months.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.600]   And, and it's really, it's very compelling.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.040]   I mean, the, the video is, you know, it's a 35 millimeter.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:11.120]   So yeah, this, this is a certain lush look to it.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.720]   And you know, we did some test keys.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.720]   You know, we're still learning.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:18.120]   I mean, this is the first one we really had to put out in a, on a tighter turn.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.720]   You know, it's not just test plates that we can kind of play with.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.720]   Right.
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.360]   So you're, you know, it's an actual production environment.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.360]   And I don't know what got into me to do it.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.920]   It was just that we, you know, we had, you know, we had, well, a Picscore member, it's
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:33.040]   actually, it's Tom Weeks, who is a Picscore member in LA bought it.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.160]   And he, I mean, he literally had just gotten it.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.800]   And I said, well, if you want to, if you want to stretch it out for you.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:42.600]   So, so he came up and so he was doing production with us with the red.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.000]   So it was, it's Tom's camera that, that, that we're getting.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.880]   But the more I use it, the more I'm like, oh, maybe I need to get a red.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   It's a really, it's a really fun camera.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.880]   We're limited right now.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.880]   It doesn't have a hard drive on the back.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.560]   So you have it, it records the compact flash.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:56.560]   Oh no.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:58.040]   But it's only four minutes per compact flash.
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.280]   So it's like, it's like having like mini mags, you know, so you're like, I got to change
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.280]   the mag.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.280]   I got to go ahead for, we have four of these, these eight gigs.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   How big are the compact flash?
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.280]   Eight gigs.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.400]   And you're changing them all the time.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.200]   You know, you gotta get four minutes.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.200]   Wonderful.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200]   You need more.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   You need bigger ones.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.200]   You can get there.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.200]   They make sixteens.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.200]   Sixteens?
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.200]   They're not making the 32s yet for red.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.880]   Because they have to be, red actually sells them because they're, they're kind of, they're
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.040]   guaranteed to work with the camera.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.000]   And so it was, but it was, it was, it was, it was, it could get eight minutes.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   But it's kind of like, yeah, it's got stuff like, but it's a pro camera with an HDMI out.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   So we're just plugging for the external monitor instead of paying for a lot for an SDI monitor
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   or whatever.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   It's plug guitar, HD, you know, LCD.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   Nice.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.800]   You know, and it, you know, it looked great.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.800]   So it's, it's a fun, it turned out really well.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.920]   We're going to do your picks in just a little bit.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.600]   A reminder that we are covering the iPhone launch.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.280]   I know it's not the Jesus phone this time around.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.080]   It's, I don't know, John the Baptist phone.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080]   It's something a little bit less.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.080]   The Mary.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.080]   It's the Mary.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.120]   It's, I'm sorry about the sack of religiousness.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.200]   It's less than the big deal it was last year, one year and 11 days ago, but it's still a
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   big deal.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.960]   And we're going to have some fun with it by doing 24 hours of iPhone.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.680]   We're going to have some coverage starting at one o'clock on Thursday, July 10th.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.600]   Actually, really more like three o'clock.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.560]   We have other shows, but in between the shows, we'll be doing it.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.240]   But the full time coverage begins at three.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.920]   Woz joins us at five.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.440]   We'll go all night long talking to people all over the world as they wait in line to
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.000]   get their new iPhone 3G.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.400]   Maybe even have some people who've already got it, give their personal reviews.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.560]   We'll be giving away 10 iPhones thanks to audible.com.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:27.560]   Thanks to Qualcomm too.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.680]   We're going to have a EVDO reports from around the United States and we'll wrap things up
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:37.360]   when the last store opens in Honolulu, Hawaii, which will be sometime around noon, I think,
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360]   Pacific time.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:43.120]   So we're going to go, you know, all day, 24 hours iPhone and Scott born and Alex Lindsey
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.360]   will join us as well and many others.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.320]   And if you want to come by, Randall, you're welcome.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.320]   I'll be in Portland.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.000]   Maybe I can go on Portland store.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Would you do that?
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   I could be great.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   I'll come do that.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.400]   And any of our listeners or viewers on Twit Live want to join us by calling in call Twit
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   Live as a Sky Panel.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.240]   We'll have open lines and I hope we'll be talking to a lot of people who are in line
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240]   and having some fun.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.880]   And as I said, the way I'm going to give away the iPhone so that it's not a contest,
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.520]   I'm just going to give them to somebody.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.040]   Whenever, you know, I feel like you've merited it in some way.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.800]   Good, good, good begging counts.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.800]   Nice begging.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.320]   Now just whenever I feel you've merited it, I'm just going to say let me give you an iPhone.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.360]   And what we have is thanks to audible.com.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.640]   We have a $200 credit towards an iPhone plus we're not going to pay your bills.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.640]   That's up to you.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.760]   Plus $100 worth of audible books to put on your new iPhone.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.920]   So that'll be kind of fun.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.640]   I imagine we'll have the first iPhone on here.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.280]   Maybe Wazzle bring his.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.280]   He could talk about it.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.280]   Yeah, I'm just thinking.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.280]   That'd be a lot of fun.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:48.200]   I can sit right across the, I guess it right in front of the Apple store that's my favorite
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.200]   Apple store close to Portland.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.200]   And I have my EVD OK.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200]   Well, that's what we want.
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.720]   We want you to bring your laptop and have your camera there and see what the scene is
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.720]   like.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.520]   I've got an old firewire eyesight camera.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.520]   Perfect.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.520]   Wherever I need to point it.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.160]   Or even if you have a DV camera, that works very well.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   Actually, that's the best way to do it.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.160]   The one thing we're suggesting for the Pixgrumbers doing it is to get an extra headphone jack.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.800]   Like an extender, like a six foot extender.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.280]   So you can put your headphone into somebody else if you wanted.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.640]   So Leo could talk to him and make it here Leo.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.720]   Oh yeah, so they can hear what I'm saying to them.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.720]   Yeah, that's a great idea.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720]   Nice.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.640]   It'll be, you know, how knows what it's going to be like.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.800]   Everything we do at this point is completely experimental.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.080]   We've never done it before.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.120]   That's kind of the fun of Twit Live.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.160]   But I do think the folks at Audible for kind of believing in us and giving us a chance
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.960]   to give away some prizes.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.920]   Also to the folks at Qualcomm for providing some EVDO modems for us.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.520]   We really appreciate that.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.920]   And to all the people at the Pixel core are going to participate and everybody around
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.000]   the world is going to participate.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   24 hours of iPhone begins tomorrow, Thursday at around 3 p.m.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.320]   That's July 10th because they go on sale July 11th in the other side of the world.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   And we'll be here all night.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.360]   It's going to be fun right about 6 in the morning when I'm starting to fall apart completely.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.360]   This should be exciting.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:59.360]   This is when the tuxedo comes loose.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.360]   It is.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.360]   It's going to be a Jerry Lewis moment I'm sure.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.400]   Hey, we're going to have some kids.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.240]   It'll be fun.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:11.120]   So let me take a break and mention Audible.com because they also bring us this.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   Is that, let me see if Andy.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.960]   Andy always has a great Audible recommendation.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:24.800]   They've gone back shopping.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.520]   This show brought to you as always by Audible.com.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.720]   Audible is a great place to get your audio books.
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.840]   We're all Audible members now.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:32.840]   You're not.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.840]   Randall, I'll set you up.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.840]   Oh, cool.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.840]   I'll hook you up.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.840]   You need to have an Audible account.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.840]   Yes.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.240]   What would you listen to if you had your choice of, I mean, there's 50,000 books.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.240]   It's hardly.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.920]   One of my favorite trilogies in science fiction is the giant series.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.160]   Paul Hogan, John Hogan, James Hogan, James Hogan.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.160]   I don't know that.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.160]   The giant series.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.160]   Let's see.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.600]   General Giants of Ganymede is one of the titles.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.360]   There's like three in the trilogy and he went on to do a couple more.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.000]   So it sort of followed on.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.800]   And I reread those books in print probably once every few years.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.400]   Listening to science fiction is so cool.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.400]   I would be happy to hear that.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   It brings it to life.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.720]   Some of them, like Dune, they do dramatization, so they have the voices.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.800]   It's still all the text.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.800]   It's every word, but when it's a woman talking, you know, Benny Jester at Priestess, it's a
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:20.920]   woman reading it.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.280]   It's really nicely done.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.760]   Let me see if they have the Hogan books for you.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.680]   They are really expanding there.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.600]   James P. Hoghan, the chat room says, yes, thank you.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.760]   It is hard SF.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.760]   It's good stuff.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.120]   Yeah, I'm a big fan of hard.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.880]   He else did two faces of tomorrow, thrice upon a time.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.360]   He's done a bunch of stuff.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.680]   He has a lot of series of books that keep within a particular universe.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.680]   Really good stuff.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680]   I really enjoyed him.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680]   I don't know if they have any James P. Hoghan.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.840]   I'm looking to see, but I'll tell you what, if they don't, they will soon because they're
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.480]   really expanding their sci-fi.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.360]   The way they've done it is a lot of the sci-fi publishers don't have the resources to do
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.360]   audio books.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.080]   Bugpark, yeah, that's one of my other favorites.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.920]   I'm just looking to see.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.640]   So what they do is they record them for them.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:12.160]   They have now nine studios, I think, at the Audible offices in New Jersey.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160]   They've Hulk Hogan.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.160]   I don't think that's going to be quite the same thing.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.160]   Come on.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.160]   Or Paul Hogan, no.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.160]   Crocodile Dundee.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.000]   You're saying James P. Hoghan.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.560]   James P. Hoghan, yes.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.560]   Well, come on.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560]   Listen to this.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.720]   How could you go wrong?
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.720]   Hollywood Hulk Hogan.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.720]   Oh, no.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:39.800]   It's not James P. Hoghan.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800]   Okay.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.960]   Now I'm really better not sure.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.680]   Everything from Hulk Hogan to James P. Hogan and everything in between.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.360]   If you want audio books, here's your deal.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.680]   We got a special deal just for you.

[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.680]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.240]   It is time for a Mac break.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.240]   Bix.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.240]   Bix.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.480]   By the way, we are going to put those promos up for the iPhone.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.880]   24 hours of iPhone.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.440]   I made some silly promos with hats.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:16.440]   Did you?
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.440]   We're going to put those up on YouTube right after I get a picture.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.160]   Merlin, man, are you still there?
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.160]   I am.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.000]   He's been strangely quiet during this interval.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   Woundship.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   He was still in the div.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   He was there.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.600]   He was reading the Wikipedia entry for Jesse Ventura.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.800]   A former governor of Minnesota.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.880]   Well, he's talking about running for senator.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.040]   And I think it's going to be fun.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:41.520]   Him against Norm Coleman and Al Franken should be an interesting race.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.520]   I'm vocal for Franken.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.520]   He's taller than I realized.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.400]   I knew that he was tall, but he's much taller than I'd realized.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.400]   Does he have a book?
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   I think he has a book.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.400]   That might be an audible.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.720]   He has a book called, what's called?
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.720]   I'm the governor.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   Something like that.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.560]   I'm the governor.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.600]   It's called, do I stand alone?
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.600]   Isn't it?
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.600]   You want to hear it?
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.840]   He's talking about freedom.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.840]   Yeah, sure.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.280]   Everything in, you know, Hannibal has everything.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.160]   A lot of people say he was a Navy ceiling.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   He wasn't.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   He was an underwater destruction technician.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   Thank you, Wikipedia.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.360]   He's a underwater demolition team.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360]   Walking Wikipedia.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.840]   My first trip to the White House was a humbling experience.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:22.240]   My wife, Terry, and I had flown to Washington for the annual Governor's Association Conference.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   I love his accent.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.240]   It's got a great voice.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.440]   It's got that great minutes and a great voice.
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.840]   Well that would be another good book.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.280]   Merlin Mann, do you have a pick of the week for us?
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.200]   You know, I don't have a specific pick of the week.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.600]   I have a, you know, I thought I'd have one by now and I don't.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.600]   I have one.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.600]   What have you been doing?
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.760]   You're going to fault me for not keeping up, aren't you?
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:49.760]   I am.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   No, I don't have a pick either.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.760]   Let's just not do picks.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.760]   It's too hot for picks.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.160]   What I was going to suggest in lieu of that, I mean, there's always great apps to talk about.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.160]   What I thought might be kind of interesting, I'm calling an audible here, really just kind
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.760]   of suggesting a thing here.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.760]   But audible is in football, not as in audio.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760]   Yes.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.840]   But, you know, I think it's interesting, this is something I'm starting for 434s.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:15.440]   I thought I'd mention a couple of previous things that I've picked that have some interesting
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.440]   topics.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.760]   You know, I think that's actually a good idea because we go through these.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.360]   We've done hundreds and hundreds of picks.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.400]   And of course, they are online, various people have created web pages.
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   I love doing it.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.400]   I love doing it.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.400]   I was just lame this week and I didn't have one ready.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.400]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.080]   I think it's not so bad, though, to do a little reprise because people don't hear every show.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.080]   What?
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.080]   What?
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.080]   Especially if there's an update.
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.080]   Well, Randall hears every show.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.480]   Not everybody hears every show.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.680]   So what's been updated that you think is worth taking a look at?
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.080]   Well, I mean, these guys should put me on their board of advisors because I pimp them
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.080]   so much.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.160]   But one password is a program that I really swear by.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.160]   Love it.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.160]   I've had it as a pick of the week.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.160]   I've had it as a pick of the week.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.160]   I love it.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.680]   If you have an iPhone and want anything approaching, you know, real world security, it's the only
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.240]   sane way to lead your life.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:07.440]   But they just, they did an update that features just a few kind of sexy cool things.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.800]   They have a new, what is the name of this feature?
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:15.640]   They have this new feature that just makes it really easy for you to search and find the
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:20.200]   password for the site that you're on right now with minimal muscle fuss.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.200]   And it's really bad.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.960]   My only issue with one password, and maybe you figure out a way.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.720]   It remembers when I enter a password on a site, it remembers it.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.840]   And then I go back to that site and I can say, you know, reenter the password.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.200]   For instance, I'm on the Wall Street Journal.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.480]   The problem is it remembers all my bad password attempts as well as the good ones.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:40.040]   And so I look and I have, I'm looking at Wall Street Journal.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.720]   I have seven or eight.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.800]   Some of these are not good.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.440]   And I have to kind of go through them one by one.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   So I find the good one.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.760]   I guess I should prune them.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.000]   Well, you know, that's a really good point.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.480]   Have you had that too?
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.560]   Because I haven't said it to auto safe passwords.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.560]   Oh, there's a couple of things.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.560]   There's a couple of things.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.200]   These are, I think I hope helpful tips for if you're using one password.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.880]   The first is kind of dull, which is just that when you notice it, have the presence of
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.920]   mine to go open one password and then delete the bad one.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.920]   Yes.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.080]   But the other thing is they do a couple of things that I really like and I've only just
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.880]   started noticing the kind of sexy stuff that it does without me thinking about it.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.440]   And as I've noticed that a lot of times now when I change a password on a site, and this
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:23.880]   is not 100%, but a lot of the time it realizes that I'm trying to, what's essentially update
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.200]   an old login.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:30.040]   So instead of creating a second login for that site with the same password, it'll say,
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.080]   do you want to update this existing one?
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.080]   That's great.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.040]   Which I think is really handy because I do try to change all of my important passwords.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.160]   I try to change every three to six weeks, depending on how important they are.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.880]   And I think that is terrific.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:46.080]   The other thing it does is, I don't know if you can turn this off.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.320]   Some people might not want this, but it keeps a history of your passwords.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   Yes.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.160]   So it'll show you, here's what you had for your Gmail password last time and so on.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:59.120]   Because something could come up in the future where it turns out you wish you remembered
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.400]   what that old password was.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.120]   Maybe it's a, so you got a broken keychain, something you need to fix.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:09.680]   But I think it's a terrific app and I'm going to try and make this feature happen.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:13.680]   You know what's happened, it's been a Mac heist pick a couple of times.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.920]   I think a lot of people got it as part of the Mac heist package.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.520]   If you did, and maybe you're not paying attention to it because there were other programs that
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.560]   you wanted to use more, do install it.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560]   I think one has to--
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.040]   But it's a really boring thing to worry about.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.040]   Which is why I think it's such a good app.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.000]   Because it's something you don't want to have to think about, but if you, you're certainly
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.840]   never going to get perfect with this stuff, but when you do think about it, it's nice
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.680]   to have this there to kind of provide.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.760]   Do you use anything like that, Randall?
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.760]   I'm curious.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.120]   I know you're a big security guy.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.120]   Do you use any kind of password management program?
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.920]   No, I just simply let Safari Auto-fill everything most of the time.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.680]   Firefox does a very good job too of remembering passwords.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.720]   The problem is you have to generate a good one to begin with.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.800]   How do you do that, Randall?
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.680]   I use the command line.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.600]   I go to use OpenSSL from the command line.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.600]   Open SSL-base64.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.880]   Do you give it as iGest to begin with?
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.280]   It's just pulling the dev rand from my system anyway.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.680]   So it's completely random and it's very high in relation to anything.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:13.960]   Very high entropy and very nice.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.400]   Since I can generate one of, you have to know how to multiply by four thirds because it
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.120]   takes the whatever number you want.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.640]   Okay, that leaves me out.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.920]   Multiply by four thirds.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.120]   Why do you have to do that?
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.960]   Because you tell it you want an eight byte password and it converts it to six hex characters
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.560]   or six base64 characters.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.120]   So give me the command so I can try it.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.120]   Okay, let me make sure I've got the right one here.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.120]   SSH.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.120]   Open SSL.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.120]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.120]   Open SSL.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:45.840]   So OpenSL-space-rand-space64.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:46.840]   And then the number eight.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.840]   I think that's right.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840]   Why the number eight?
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.840]   It's three four.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.920]   So you say six to get an eight character password.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:53.920]   I see.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.920]   So that's why you multiply.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.920]   That's going to tell you how many.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:56.920]   Yeah, it's right.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:57.920]   You get to three four.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.840]   And so now it's generated a great.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.360]   It looks like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight character passwords.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.840]   Six generates eight.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.560]   Using letters, numbers, and punctuation.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560]   It's base64.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   So it's alphanumeric's upper and lowercase.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.520]   And that, every time I run the command is going to give me a completely unique, different
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520]   one.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.920]   And it's using the entropy from your system so it's about as strong as it can possibly
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.920]   be.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:19.920]   And you can plus oddly.
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:25.280]   And the base64 has, we only have, let's see, 52, 62, right?
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.280]   So you need two more characters.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.680]   So it has dot and plus, I think.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.640]   So that's the only punctuation it uses.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.640]   I see.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   But these are still strong.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.640]   And I'm not strong enough.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:34.640]   Oh, this stuff.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.240]   No, you have one password there, Leo.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.800]   Like, can you give us a do it?
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.560]   Yeah, be kind of fun to show him how it generates.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.560]   It has.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.560]   I did.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.560]   I showed that a little earlier.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.560]   And it really is.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.560]   It's cool.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.720]   So I'm using one password right now.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:52.520]   And if I zoom into the strong password generator, it's actually a really great one.
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.520]   So I'm on the Wall Street Journal site.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.600]   So it says password for Wall Street Journal dot com.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.600]   You have three choices.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:00.880]   Pronounceable with a hyphen digits or no separator.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:06.800]   So you can have a digest, which means you'll give it something like this is my standard
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.480]   phrase or something like that.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.560]   And it does a digest based on that.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.760]   Or completely random.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:17.840]   You could say how many digits, how many symbols, avoid ambiguous characters like zero and an
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.320]   O, L and one.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.600]   And then you could tell it how long it should be so I can make it even longer.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.480]   This is probably using very similar pseudo random number generators in the system.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.440]   And then you can copy that to the clipboard.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.160]   And the point is this is completely unmemorable password.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.920]   But one password will remember it for you.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920]   You better hope it will.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.160]   Because if you don't never get that password back.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.680]   But also what's nice is that, God, I really do feel like a shill at this point, but it
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.680]   also works with Keychain.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.320]   All the more reason why you hope your dot Mac is secure, but it works with the key chain.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.040]   So it's all, you know, hooked up.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:55.440]   Keychain we should point out has its own strong password generator built into it.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.440]   That's a good one, right?
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.760]   Yeah, that's again pulling from the same entropy.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.760]   That's a good idea.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.760]   Should be pretty good.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.200]   And it's not using that hacked.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.840]   Was it the, they changed the pseudo random number generator in the SSL keys.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.160]   Yeah, but I heard about this.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160]   That was a lot less.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160]   That was a lot less.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.160]   It was less entropy than people thought.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.160]   They took out all the entropy.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:18.000]   It was completely, they had only 65,000 possible passwords.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.040]   Is that why I kept getting pencil over and over and over again?
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.280]   And then once I got, I got pencil 69.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280]   That's it.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   That was it.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.120]   That's the randomness right there.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.120]   Good pick.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.080]   One password, anything else been updated lately that you want to mention?
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.120]   Oh gosh, you know, I'm sorry.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.120]   I'm really ill prepared.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.840]   The, there was another one in the queue.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.840]   Well, there was a quick silver update that just came out.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.840]   Oh, is there?
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.640]   I see I just have quick silver automatically do my update.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.640]   So I don't even know.
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.680]   Well, it's controversial because this is the first one of the first big releases after
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   it went open source.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.680]   And people are telling me they're finding it really buggy.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.680]   I haven't had to.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   Ooh.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.880]   This won't auto update either because it's a separate stream.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.400]   Quick silver went open source.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.400]   When did that happen?
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   About six months ago.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   A member.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.600]   Is he no longer developing it or is he the lead?
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.080]   Of course doing reportedly, it's hard to tell because he can't really speak on the phone
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.000]   because of his, you know, flipper hands.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   And the bariatric chamber.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   I know makes it difficult.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.520]   But he, but reportedly he's just after years of threatening to do so is apparently doing
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.600]   a bottom up rewrite of the whole framework.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:15.600]   Wow.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.040]   But he's been saying all along.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.360]   And I mean, I have not followed this closely as you would think given what a quick silver
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.360]   nerd I am.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.380]   But the story goes that, you know, he's always considered his code to be kind of like an
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:28.360]   embarrassing jumble because, you know, I started, that was a kind of a fun side.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.860]   It was like, I'm sure.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:30.860]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:34.800]   So even if I have pre-release candidates selected in my updates, Randall, I won't get the,
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.360]   no, this is from the totally different sites.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.200]   So I'm going to go to Google code.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.200]   Yeah, Google code now.
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.360]   It's called something different too is like vagabond or something weird.
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.360]   Alchemy.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   Alchemy.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360]   Alchemy is the next.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.800]   Alchemy is like when he does the thing he's really wanted to do.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.920]   So what's your recommendation on that?
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.920]   Should I go?
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.120]   I've, I'm running the new code.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.560]   I haven't had much problem yet.
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.560]   I would get you.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:03.740]   But I have my quick silver inside a launch D-demon so that every time it crashes it automatically
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:04.900]   restarts it.
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:05.900]   That's a voter confidence.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.280]   I, I, I, I gotta do that.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.280]   We got to do that.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.280]   You can tell me how to do that too.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.280]   That's a great trick.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.740]   You can, you can, you can get to that one too.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:14.740]   You can, you can get to that one too.
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.740]   You can get to that one too.
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:16.740]   Yeah, I'd use Lingan.
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:17.740]   That's it.
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:19.740]   Wow.
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:20.740]   Merlin, you're, I didn't know you were such command line geek.
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.740]   Yeah, you know, it's funny.
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:23.740]   A lot of what I do is with computers.
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.740]   Well, actually, you mentioned command line.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:27.580]   I tell you what I tell all like kids, Leo, look forward.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.660]   And that is, it's also gives me a chance to have him another app I like in a, in a
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:32.460]   pimp on here before, which is roo switch.
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.700]   I don't know your, what's that?
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:34.700]   Oh, you're kidding.
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:35.700]   I haven't pimped roo switch on your platform.
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:36.700]   I don't think you have.
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:37.700]   I don't remember it.
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:38.700]   What does it do?
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:39.700]   Oh man, roo switch is the cheese man.
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:44.940]   You, so it's an app you download and when you open it up, you get a little dropable pain
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:49.900]   and you drop an application icon onto the drop thing and it says, okay, I've just created
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:52.540]   a profile for you for, in this case, quick silver.
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:55.620]   I'm going to back up this application and I'm going to remember all the settings that
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:58.620]   appear to be associated with that.
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.540]   And then so you can create a new blank profile.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:01.940]   You can create a duplicate of that profile.
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:02.940]   Why is this useful?
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.980]   It's useful because a, if you're working with anything where your data might become compromised
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:11.840]   by something like a, you're on an early alpha of an app, it's a great way to make sure you
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.140]   get something you can roll back to without any kind of subversion like madness.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:19.220]   And second, if you do demos for people like the stuff where you do like on Mac break,
[01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:20.220]   like the, right, right.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:21.220]   Fantastic.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:24.520]   And then if you're not going to make a video of that, I'm going to say, I'm going to make
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.520]   a video of that.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.520]   I'm going to make a video of that.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.520]   And I'm going to make a video of that.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.

[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.520]   And then I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:20:04.020]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:28.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:35.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.

[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:39.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:44.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:49.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:59.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:04.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:09.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:14.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:29.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:39.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:44.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:49.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:54.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:59.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:04.520]   And I'm going to make a video of it.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:09.520]   And that's not a home lab.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   That's like a little broadcast.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:17.520]   We do a little experiment here.
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:23.520]   So everyone watching Twit Live needs to go to Mughalas
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.520]   and go to the Pearl channel right now.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:32.520]   I want to break it.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:37.520]   We're going to go.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:42.520]   It's like 89, 91, 91.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:47.520]   Hey, everybody, go outside for a while.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:52.520]   103 viewers.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:57.520]   Here we go, 108 viewers.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:02.520]   He's running an open window and he's got 200 people
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.520]   just sitting there looking at us.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.520]   He's taking over 144 viewers.
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.520]   I'm glad we could.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:15.520]   Sorry.
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   Okay, thank you for that.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.520]   That's not my pick, by the way.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:24.520]   What is your pick?
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.520]   I have a pick, actually.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.520]   It's a software solution.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:32.520]   This is the thing that would feed.
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.520]   All web-based.
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:36.520]   It's all flash-based.
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:39.520]   It's all easy to do that kind of multi-channel stuff.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:44.520]   Actually, lepton suggests in the chat room everybody,
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:49.520]   now I'll go to your toilet and flush.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:54.520]   We'll see what happens.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:59.520]   How many?
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.520]   One-twenty-th.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:09.520]   It's 40 bucks.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:14.520]   It's Amadeus Pro.
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:17.520]   It's a little audio editing program.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.520]   Think about Dasty, but with a much more Mac-like interface
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:27.520]   on you, I'm doing it to do lightweight podcasting.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:32.520]   I do the Squeak Weekly News for a weekly small talk podcast.
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:35.520]   I use this to record it because it's quick, it gets it out,
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:38.520]   so I can do quick inserts, delete, clip audio from one thing or
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:39.520]   another.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.520]   Another thing I like though is that it has honest-to-goodness MP3
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:46.520]   exporting, which some of them won't have because of the licensing issues.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.520]   It uses, I think, the layman coder.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.520]   It does a very nice job.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:53.520]   I've been using this for some time, I actually really like Amadeus Pro.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:59.520]   I use it to record on the road because it has great little recording capabilities.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:01.520]   It's got a great little editor.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.520]   You can even multi-track with it, which is kind of smooth.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   Exactly, so it's kind of amazing.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520]   It's like a Dasty, but cleaned up a bit.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:10.520]   It also does, it does a audio filters.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:17.520]   Mac-AU filters just fine, which means that I did a little bit for Chris Markwart's show,
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.520]   where I wanted to sound like I had my hand over the phone while I was having a conversation.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.520]   So I just did a quick little low pass 800 kilohertz little thing.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:27.520]   It just made it sound like, "Oh, it's muffled a bit."
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.520]   It was perfect.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.520]   It just came out the first time and it dragged through the parts I wanted to edit.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:33.520]   It was a really cooler program.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.520]   It was a little confusing.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:38.520]   You've seen a lot of the basic, it gives you access to a lot of the basic Apple audio.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.520]   All the Apple.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:40.520]   Yeah, all the Apple.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:41.520]   Yeah, all the Apple.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:43.520]   And then I bought, for instance, Ozone 3 from Isotope.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:47.520]   So that's a VST effect and it uses VST plugins as well.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.520]   Exactly.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.520]   So I can use the high end, for instance, Ozone 3 filters.
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:52.520]   And these are great.
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.520]   In fact, I have a number of filters on here as well.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:57.520]   So this is a power tool.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:03.520]   I think in some ways it's better than Soundtrack Pro, which is Apple's own sound editor that is available only
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.520]   if you buy a spinal cut studio.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.520]   And it's just easy to use.
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.520]   You can get into it and just record basic stuff and you can see it away from the running.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:10.520]   Just there.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.520]   Yeah, it does multi-track.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.520]   It does multi-track.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:15.520]   Yeah, I can add tracks to it arbitrarily, mix them down.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.520]   Mump them down.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:19.520]   We've used it for on the road production for at least a couple of years.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.520]   It's really good.
[01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.520]   This is Amadeus Pro and it's not this one.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.520]   40 bucks, right?
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.520]   40 bucks.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.520]   Very reasonably priced.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:26.520]   Highly recommend that myself.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.520]   We've used it for some time and I think it's a really good program.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:31.520]   Yep.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:32.520]   There you go.
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:33.520]   There's my pick for the week.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.520]   All right.
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.520]   I don't have a pick because you guys did such a good job.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:37.520]   I'm just going to take the day off.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.520]   My pick is 10,000 BTU air conditioners wherever you can find them.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:42.520]   Yummy.
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.520]   We want to thank you all for joining us.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.520]   Thank you, Merlin, man.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:47.520]   My pleasure.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.520]   Thank you for having me.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.520]   Really appreciate it.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.520]   You'll find Merlin.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.520]   He does that great.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.520]   You look nice today.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:55.520]   Podcast with Scott Simpson and he's hot.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.520]   I love how John Hodgman says hot dogs ladies.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.520]   What is John Hodgman?
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:01.520]   Who is that?
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.520]   I have no idea.
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:03.520]   I just thought that was the guy.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.520]   Are you afraid to announce her and Mr. Nguyen?
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:08.520]   Oh, his name is Mr. Nguyen.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.520]   Mr. Nguyen.
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:10.520]   He's a war criminal.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.520]   He sounds uncannily like the guy who does the PC in those commercials.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.520]   He deserved a little bit of time and he had fiction lessons.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:17.520]   So that might be worth hearing.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:19.520]   Hot dogs ladies.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.520]   He says it very precisely.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.520]   Lonely sandwich.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.520]   And Scott Simpson who apparently doesn't have a clever nickname.
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.520]   He's a very favorite fellow.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.520]   That's Scott Simpson.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.520]   Scott Simpson he had to adopt a normal name.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.520]   Because he works at the paper company.
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.520]   And the paper company works for a made him.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.520]   Made him do that.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:38.520]   You may not have a funny name.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.520]   They're like that, aren't they?
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.520]   Those guys.
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:42.520]   You look nice today.com.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.520]   Highly recommended of course you know Merlin's 43 folders.com.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.520]   His site fives the number 5ives.com.
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.520]   Have you put some new fives up lately?
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:53.520]   You're probably doing so many other things.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.520]   I don't know if you have time.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:55.520]   I don't know what I'm doing anymore Leo.
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.520]   It's all very confusing.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:59.520]   Yeah, I had five unusual top chef production titles.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.520]   That was a recent one.
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.520]   Let's see here what some of these are.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.520]   Fohawk sharpener.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:04.520]   I like that.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.520]   Everybody go to fives and crash it.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.520]   Timpani dramaticizer.
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.520]   Five poetic phrases called from Joe McConnell's Bay Area traffic report.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:16.520]   So you would only know Joe McConnell if you were in the Bay Area.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.520]   But I have to say this is for me.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.520]   This is very funny because I listen to NPR.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.520]   Joe McConnell does the traffic reports.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:24.520]   I love seeing Jack Knight Big Rick.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:25.520]   Jack Knight Big Rick.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:26.520]   Big Rick.
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.520]   Backed up to the maze.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.520]   It is Friday light.
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:29.520]   It's Friday light.
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.520]   Slow in pockets.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.520]   But your favorite goat on the shoulder.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:33.520]   I have a slow down.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:34.520]   I have a slow down.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:35.520]   I have a slow down.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:38.520]   We got a goat on the shoulder.
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.520]   So that's one of many Merlin man sites.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:41.520]   He's got a lot.
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.120]   Yeah, you're so nice to pimp my crap.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.120]   That's nice of you.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.120]   Thank you very much.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:47.120]   Is that registered pimpmycrap.com?
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   I might run out.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.120]   It is now.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.120]   It might run out and get that.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.520]   Ah, the one who live right here.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.520]   Dick DiBartolo is watching Hill Register.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:55.520]   Hill Register is right away.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:56.520]   No register.
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.880]   Actually, I did want to mention tweet deck.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:04.320]   I mentioned this yesterday on, I feel like, I feel like I'm, I don't know, cheating on
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:09.000]   you guys because I did actually mention this on net at night yesterday.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.400]   So it's not like, it's not like your own special Mac break weekly.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.400]   It's an Adobe air app.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.400]   I'm loving Adobe air apps.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.280]   In fact, we now have a live Adobe air app, which I'm going to put up on the blog as soon
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:19.280]   as I get a chance.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:21.240]   I think Adobe air is going to do a lot.
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.240]   I hate it in a way.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.480]   I hate it because I want things like sprout core, which are open source.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:28.680]   I want them to do better, to be honest with you.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:32.320]   But in Adobe, I don't want to see proprietary Adobe solutions kind of take over the internet.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.280]   On the other hand, they work.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:36.600]   Yeah, that's the bottom one.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.960]   So this is, I'll launch it right now for you.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:42.600]   This is tweet deck, T-W-E-E-T-D-E-C-K.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.440]   It's for people who use the Twitter, and I know, you know, a lot of you don't want to
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.360]   hear about the Twitter, and I don't blame you.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.720]   Does it show the fail well and some spinning 3D animation needs to do?
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:51.720]   You know what it has?
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:53.520]   That the best part is in the lower right hand counter.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.000]   It has Twitter status.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.560]   So you know if, if it's not working, why it's not working right now, Twitter is pretty
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:00.560]   much okay.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.720]   But here's what it does that I really like.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.120]   It gives you columns.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.040]   So you have the standard kind of all tweets column, but you also have a column just to
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.040]   reply.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.400]   And this is always up if you want, you can close it, but it's always up.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.960]   Of direct messages to you.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:16.040]   Hey, Marissa Goldmark, how you doing?
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.840]   Victor Caiot is going to, Victor, come by in the studio, Victor from Typical Mac User.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:24.040]   So you see, I'm seeing my direct messages for the first time, but that's nice.
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:26.400]   You can also group people together.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.520]   So you can make a group of people you want to follow, and you can do searches.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:34.680]   So if I do a semi search, I can have that be a column in tweet deck.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.760]   Can you group people together that don't want to be grouped together?
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.360]   You can group anybody you want.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360]   Wow.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.360]   Wow.
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:41.360]   I'm from left country.
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.680]   And then you also get a timeframe slider.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.160]   So you can say, I only want to see messages say from the last 24 hours or all the way up
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.120]   to 48 hours, depending on Twitter and what it can do.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.280]   This is tweet deck.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:53.280]   And I think it's just a good example.
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:55.960]   You know, there are a lot of great Twitter apps like Twitterific.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:58.120]   I use twirl pretty much all the time.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:03.280]   But this shows once again what you could do, I think, with Adobe Air, especially with
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.640]   a site like Twitter that is up and down a lot.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:11.040]   This gives it some stability, gives it a desktop kind of presence that's always there.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:12.280]   So that actually is a pick.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.560]   I didn't mean to do it, but it is a pick.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:14.560]   It's a good pick.
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:15.560]   I'm going to use it.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.560]   I really like it.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.440]   Because it's a much more advanced version of Twitterific or...
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:21.600]   Have you used twirl?
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.600]   Do you use twirl?
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.920]   No, I've used twittorific.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.920]   Try twirl.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:29.120]   What I use twirl for is it allows you to cross post to Jikou, Pounce and Twitter.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:32.920]   It also follows friend feed, which has become the new Twitter.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:35.360]   And so you can follow your friend feed in multiple accounts and twirl.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:37.040]   So I have several accounts.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:40.640]   So I'll use twirl to follow all of the different twittor accounts.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.640]   And does that well?
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:42.640]   Look at these.
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.640]   These are all different Twitter accounts.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.760]   So I'll pull this up here real quick.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.840]   So this is my friend feed.
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.840]   This is Twitt Live.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.240]   This is Roz Savage, because I'm posting her Twitter updates, because she's at C. And
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.440]   this is my Leo report.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:00.840]   Now, you are seeing, by the way, a weird artifact that happens sometimes with air, which is
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.600]   that the mouse doesn't seem to actually control any window.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.280]   There's a little thing to watch.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.280]   There's a little fear.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.280]   Nothing happens.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.920]   But that's why they have a reset windows button that will actually make all the windows
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.320]   move in a position.
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:16.960]   So yeah, it's doing a little weird thing right there.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.960]   They're all that.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:18.960]   They're all the answers, vendors.
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:21.360]   And one will move and the other one won't move.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.560]   Anyway, twirl is another one.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.000]   But I think I've already recommended TWHIRL.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.280]   Both of those are Adobe Air applications.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:33.800]   Mr. Randall Schwartz, you could find him at Stonehenge.com.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:37.320]   And of course, he's the host of Floss Weekly, our open source podcast.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:39.320]   In fact, we're going to do one right after this.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:41.120]   We're going to talk about SugarCRM.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.120]   John Roberts, CEO.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.640]   That should be very interesting.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.880]   That's one of the big enterprise open source applications.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:46.880]   Absolutely.
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:47.960]   It's doing very, very well.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:48.960]   You can also--
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.440]   It's got a lot of stuff.
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:51.440]   What does?
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.440]   It's got a lot of stuff.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.760]   There's a lot going on in Sugar.
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.440]   Sugar, have you used it?
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:56.800]   Yeah, I played with it.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.000]   And I was terrified.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]   It was overwhelmed.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000]   It was almost like Joomla.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   There was so much going on.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.200]   I think it's for people who use people soft and stuff like that to do their customer
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.200]   relationship.
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:09.400]   It's kind of like for people who would use-- what's the big one that everybody uses?
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.520]   Workforce or whatever it's--
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:13.520]   Salesforce.com is the online one.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:16.840]   There's PeopleSoft, which is probably the big one, the big commercial application.
[01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:17.840]   Well, this is commercial too.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:18.840]   It's also open source.
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.680]   It's probably what we're going to talk about.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:24.440]   It's a unique kind of position in the open source world.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.440]   And he does Geek Cruises News, which has been--
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.240]   You can insightcruisesnews.com.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.360]   Please go.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:31.360]   Please listen.
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:32.920]   He'll get on a boat with us.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.840]   I will be on a boat with you.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:35.840]   You're from now.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.240]   Yeah, this is how far you have to book ahead now because these cruises have become so popular.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:43.440]   We're going to China, Korea, and Japan in July 2009.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:44.440]   Yes.
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.080]   And that's Mac Mania 9.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.080]   I can't wait for that.
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:48.080]   That'll be great.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:49.080]   It'll be really incredible.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:50.480]   I think I'm going to bring Henry on that one.
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:53.280]   I told Henry yesterday, I said, "Henry, we're going to China next summer."
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.280]   He said, "No."
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.680]   He says, "If I could do it in five hours, I'm going."
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:57.680]   I said, "No, Henry.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:59.480]   It takes like 12 hours to fly there.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.880]   Nah, nah, nah, I don't want to go."
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:06.920]   And I was just with Mr. Insight Cruises himself, Neil Bauman, the last couple of days.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.760]   And he has convinced me that the pre-cruise trip of the China--
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:11.760]   That's the one I want to go on.
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:12.760]   That's also what I'm going to do now.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:13.760]   Are you good?
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.960]   I thought about waiting five days at the end of the cruise just to see the sky get dark
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:18.960]   for 20 minutes.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:19.960]   Solar eclipse.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:20.960]   Yeah, not worth it.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.960]   Not worth it.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:22.960]   Because it might be cloudy anyway.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:26.000]   No, so there is a land portion of this cruise that you and I will be going on, and Henry
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.360]   will be going on, which goes to most of China Beijing, the Great Wall.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.400]   We'll get to see the soldiers and all.
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.400]   I've never been to China.
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.120]   And first-class travel in the sense that we're getting to go places that a lot of people
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.600]   wouldn't go, they're just plain tourists.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.600]   Oh, that's fun.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.600]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:41.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.600]   Oh, I better book that one.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:43.600]   That's why I said it's going to be--
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.600]   Exactly.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.440]   Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel Core at PixelCore.com.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:52.360]   If you want to know more about that great group, that guild of multimedia artists, a place
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.960]   to learn, but then also find work.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.480]   And also PixelCore.tv is where the podcasts are.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:01.320]   This week in photography, twiptphoto.com is one of the big ones.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:03.920]   Yes, and I'd like to actually pimp a show that I'm not on.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:04.920]   What's that?
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:05.920]   Twim.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:07.920]   Now you have Denise, Daisy Whitney.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.920]   Daisy Whitney has been hosting that.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.920]   She's been guest hosting.
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:14.360]   I think that the show has become really tight.
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.720]   She's from TV week.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.720]   She knows media.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:19.480]   Really, and what we're doing is we're working on-- we're going to have another show that's
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:21.840]   really focusing on the tech of media.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:24.840]   It was just a little too chaotic to have both conversations trying to keep it together.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:26.000]   So you're going to do a twim tech?
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000]   So that's hopefully we'll launch that in August.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.160]   That's when you'll talk about red cameras and all gorgas and red cameras and TV and all
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.160]   that stuff.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.000]   And so-- but we're going to keep-- Daisy, I think, has just been doing.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.680]   She's been bringing on amazing guests.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:43.560]   She's been bringing really, really great conversations around the business and media.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:44.560]   And people are into it.
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:46.560]   I would highly suggest checking it out.
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.560]   Good.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:48.560]   Good, good, good.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:49.560]   That's Twim.
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.560]   That's all available at PixelCore.tv.
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.200]   That's the best place to go for this podcast.
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.200]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.200]   We don't forget we will be doing 24 hours live of iPhone.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:04.000]   We start about 3 o'clock Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern on July 10th talking to people around the
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.640]   world who are getting their iPhones.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:09.880]   And we'll continue for, well until at least in noon the following day.
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:13.960]   It's 24 hours because we're going to start our coverage really more like 8 a.m. on Thursday.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.640]   So it's more like-- I don't know.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:16.640]   I'll have a counter.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:19.640]   They'll just say how many hours I've gone without sleeping or peeing.
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:23.520]   And that's what we've been practicing here on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.840]   We've got it up to two hours now with no breaks.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.560]   We thank you all for your patience.
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.440]   We'll see you next time.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:30.440]   Another Mac Break.
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:31.120]   Here's broke.
