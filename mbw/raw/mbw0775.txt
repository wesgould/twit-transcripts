[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Yes, I'm back. Still my mind's still on the
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.900]   beach, but I'm here. We're gonna talk about lots of Apple stuff, including the
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.480]   revelation that the NSO group's Pegasus spyware can crack into even late model
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.000]   iPhones. I fix it. Kyle Wien makes a pretty strong case for the right to repair,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.300]   and Apple's decided to keep the offices closed just a little bit longer. Mac
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:38.740]   Break Weekly is next. Podcasts you love from people you trust. This is Twitter.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:50.340]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 775, recorded Tuesday, July 20th, 2021. Guacamole 2,
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.020]   the dippening. It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.940]   news from Apple. Hello, my name is Leo LaPorte. Perhaps you remember me from such
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.340]   shows as Mac Break Weekly many, many years ago. Thank you, Alex Lindsey, for
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.020]   filling in for me last week. Pleasure. As you can see, I've gone native. Looks
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.340]   great. Yeah, I decided what the heck. I'm not really ready to leave the Aloha
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.780]   spirit behind you. Anyway, I'm glad to be back. It's good to have you back. I
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.300]   have a, you know, I always, this show is much more complicated than it looks on
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.020]   the outside. So when you're actually hosting, you know, you're like, wow, this
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.380]   is really hard. I'm used to it. I talked for four hours a day, but I'm used to
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.740]   20 people. You invented this show. It should be easy for you. This is your show, man.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.540]   It's good. It's good. It was fun. Oh, 9/0 media.media and of course,
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.020]   office hours dot global with us also Mr. Andy Nachol of WGB, B. H.
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.860]   Bolstin. Hello Andrew. Hello. Yeah, you look like you're about to like
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.780]   advertise your own line of margarita mix. Like that's gonna be the picture.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.780]   Well, you know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.420]   I don't know. Are native in Hawaii, but then nothing really is including all
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.540]   the things you're like coconuts and pineapples and macadamia nuts. They're
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.340]   famous for so why not? And I had plenty of avocados this week. Let me tell you.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.700]   Some of them on my shirt. Also here from Montreal, Canada, Renee Richie,
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.100]   YouTube.com/Renee Richie, a little too far north for the gentle avocado to
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.900]   bloom. But Leo, I loved you. I loved your performance in Guacamole to the
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.180]   different. But I think what most people don't know about last week, Alex was too
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.740]   nice to point out that he gave Andy and I two takes each and then replaced us
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:52.700]   with CGI. Yeah, I was exactly the show we wanted. No takes. Did anything go
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.940]   on while I was gone? Did Apple make any announcements? For instance, battery
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.980]   pack. Yes. Battery pack. See, I ordered immediately. In fact, today we got iOS 14.7
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.340]   ostensibly for the the new MagSafe battery pack, which hasn't come yet.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.500]   Did you get yours? Renee, why should be arriving today? Good. And if it does,
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   I can unbox it on the show. So if you see me run across the room real quick,
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.620]   that'll be the reason idea. I guess is that if you have a MagSafe case or no
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.780]   case at all, the battery pack goes suck right onto that magnet.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.380]   Thwock. And then we'll see how well it holds. It will add certain amount of
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.100]   weight, but it'll also add a lot of juice. Although I had to say the iPhone 12, I
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.700]   have a pro max gets got me through the day just fine. It's the mini. It's the
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.420]   mini that needs it. They need like a camera batteries. You can throw on them.
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.460]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yes. So there was an Apple announcement. How exciting is
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.300]   that? They waited for you to leave. They waited for me. But I woke up that
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.100]   morning and ordered it within seconds. Thanks to Apple Pay. Yeah. Apple
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.860]   pay was amazed. Very easy to buy things, which is I was unfortunately, I was
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.140]   amazed that I ordered some Mac minis. I needed some more Mac minis this week.
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.620]   And because yeah, everyone needs more Mac minis and Sunday after Sunday
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.980]   morning or yeah late Sunday morning, I ordered Mac minis on the Apple App Store
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.540]   Apple Store app and it showed up in an hour and 45 minutes later. Like it was
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.420]   like at my house. I was just like, I yeah, I was yeah, I couldn't believe it.
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.140]   And so I'm wearing pants. Yeah, somebody drive over from the Apple store and
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.020]   drop it off. Literally. They I think they use I heard they use Postmates or
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.860]   something to do it. But yeah, they delivered it to my house in a car in like a
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.060]   little Apple tote. Like it didn't even come in a box. It was like two little
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.100]   Apple bags like I just bought it. And I had my own two new Mac minis. Isn't that
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.900]   great? That just makes it way too easy. It's way easier. It would be harder quick
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.020]   before he changes his mind. I want to take it. It would have taken me an hour
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.780]   and a half to go to the Apple store back, you know, with all the parking and
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.340]   everything else. I say, you know, I didn't say any time, but I mean, I say,
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.260]   wasn't me driving the other thing I ordered while I was in Hawaii is a
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.140]   valves new stream deck, which I will be getting me to Christmas 2023. No,
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.180]   no, 2022. Did you get the errors Leo? Because we got so I could you and I were
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.980]   trying to order it. So I got up at the ungodly hour of 7 a.m. Hawaii time.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.340]   Yeah, a little easier. No, wasn't that a godly, but I did get up to
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.380]   order it. And yeah, the I couldn't it just crashed out on me and then but
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.580]   this were used to this by now only Apple. You watching Twitter because I was
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.380]   watching Matthew Pan's arena was failing. Christina Warren was failing. I think
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.180]   contemplating VPNing into Ireland to buy one with Steve's trot and Smith.
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.500]   Tom Warren from the Verge was failing. We got the error. You had to have a valve
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.060]   account in good standing that you'd used previously. So you couldn't scalp it.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.260]   But there are a bunch of people who were trying to order instead. You haven't
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.620]   used this account in 12 years. And what we got was you are trying to you're
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.980]   trying to buy this too much. We're looking at the way. You're too interested
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.540]   in our product that makes that creeps us out. And it was just give us some
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.860]   small space. You know, it's credit though to steam and valve. This is this is a
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.620]   handheld kind of tenant switch like device. Switch for nerds and credit to
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.660]   them for doing everything they can't could to eliminate kind of scalping. So
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.460]   you had to have purchased before June something on steam so that you're not
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.140]   just Johnny come lately. And if you didn't there was a two day window and
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.220]   you'd had to wait. They really did everything they could. But I think nobody
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.460]   can anticipate the kind of traffic. And according to a leak in the web page
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.500]   that was leaking information, they sold like a hundred thousand units in the
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.820]   first hour. It looks so good though. Leo, it looks so good. Like it really is like
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.420]   a switch for nerds. Like you can't remove the controllers, but who cares? It is a
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.180]   full PC and it comes with steam OS, which is fine. But you can put windows on
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.860]   it comes with the storage. All you need.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.820]   You can run he max on it. But I'm saying it's like it's not locked down at all.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.620]   Like it is completely locked at steam store. You can get other stores. Specifically
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.900]   said you can run all of the Unix software, you know, pack Pacman, Pamac,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.580]   whatever it is that you like to use to install software. Yeah, you know, so it
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.500]   can run that's going to run the pro turn. It's going to be a good thing for
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.100]   Linux gaming because it is a Linux device, which means that this is going to be a
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.660]   lot more people running Linux. Yeah, I mean, it was it was incredible. I I
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.140]   would have tried to buy one if had if not if not for the fact that I've already
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.820]   like promised myself I'm going to pre order a play date when pre orders over
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.820]   sometime this month. It was such it was when you when you look at a device like
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.300]   this, you expect a big company say, okay, but we're going to lock it down so that
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.980]   it only runs stuff from the steam store, right? That we saw them and we're going
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.740]   to make sure that it's only used as a handheld. You can't plug in like an external
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.940]   screen or extra. No, this is it's like Renee says, I kept. Yeah, I mean, well, I
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.020]   mean, I kept rereading every reading said there's got to be another gotcha that
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:07.780]   says that essentially $400 minimum buy in for what could be a very, very flexible
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.340]   like sort of portable definitely gaming oriented. But if you wanted to try to
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.740]   talk yourself into thinking that it could be a productivity based. Well, and
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.780]   for saying, Oh, no, no, no, I need a handheld PC for doing my writing on you
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.780]   could just I can just plug in a keyboard for that and for $400. That's not a
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.700]   whole lot of money for a desktop PC. And I could see us using it for all kinds of
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.300]   things around production, you know, with the PC app, you know, you have PC apps,
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.380]   now you have all these little controllers, whether it's like you could be cutting
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.180]   shows, you could be doing other, you know, moving graphics around, you could be
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.820]   doing a lot of other things than just, then you know, imagine unreal in there and
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.060]   being able to kind of work with it, work in things in unreal, like building things
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.700]   and driving them with it could be a really awesome way to, way to do animation.
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.420]   I'll let you know next Christmas. Exactly. They were smart though, they
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.980]   required $5, which kind of keeps the although immediately on eBay, you know,
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.660]   and like, you know, yeah, that right now. You don't have to buy it because
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.260]   Anthony, you got yours right or you ordered yours. When is your supposed to come?
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:16.180]   Probably Q one. Yeah. If you the very earliest orders you could get it
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.100]   December, but I think most of them would be Q one 20. It took us 45 minutes, I think,
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.700]   and we're probably I gave up. I was so furious, especially when it finally said,
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.140]   you bet you you can't buy it because you're you're too. That's why Georgia's husband did.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.460]   Yeah, I gave up and then I came back that night and I was able to order it. That's why I wasn't.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.300]   I'm not going to get till Christmas 20 when the first one's supposed to ship.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.740]   The very earliest that they said was Chris December. Yeah, this December, but I'll be getting it.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:46.340]   You know, it's it's interesting they're even putting a flag in the sand for that date because
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.860]   Microsoft for instance refuses to do that with this Xbox Series X because they said we don't
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.740]   we have no idea when we're going to be able to get those chips and we don't want to promise
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.460]   something we can't deliver. It's my guess. They only have to have one chip. We started shipping
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.580]   that. Yeah, we started $100. You know, it's like, yeah, we got milk. Yeah, it's it just shows you
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:10.020]   what and I'm going to turn this back to Apple. I'm sorry, but it's a job. It's just just show it.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.620]   I have two choices. I can say, well, you might be able to install Mac OS on this. I'm going to
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.020]   not do that. And then the second choice would be it just shows you how well Apple
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:24.420]   handles a supply chain issue because they are able to handle this, you know, after years of
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.700]   difficulties pretty fluidly. I'm sure they get at least 100,000 people banging on their door
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.940]   the minute that it's available and they say battery packs. Yeah, they do pretty they do pretty well.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.860]   And credit to steam, which had no eggs, you know, not much experience with this. Their previous
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:47.940]   steam PC was not very popular. This is a precursor to a mobile VR headset. This is them stepping their
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.300]   foot in the water of mobile computing so they can start making things like the valve index
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.740]   more portable. Yeah, I mean, they certainly know they certainly want to do that, right?
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:01.540]   Yeah, the the company management has said that one of the reasons why they had hit that price
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.700]   point is that this is this is not an experiment. This is not, hey, if this works out, then maybe
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.340]   we'll think about doing something else. This is the launch of an entire strategy and hardware
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.820]   and they want to make sure that they get the first they get a set a lot of people invested in the
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.700]   first round and also that they get this right so they get a reputation for delivering a satisfying
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:25.060]   experience. Three starts at three ninety nine for kind of the lowest end. Most I think almost
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:31.380]   everybody I saw was saying, Oh, let's just get this $650 model, which is the top 512 gigs and VME
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:37.620]   storage and a premium. It's not expensive. What you're getting? No, by the way, I noticed that on
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:43.620]   the web pages says expected order availability Q two twenty twenty two. I bet if I log in, that
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.580]   will change. We're complaining about the display the same way they complained about iPhone 10
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.900]   R and iPhone 11 displays, but on mobile devices, that's that's a benefit, not a bug because like
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:58.740]   you don't need high density for that for the battery life is so much better. It's just over 720.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.060]   It's like not even 10. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you don't need it. It's wasted pixels and it's
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.300]   just drained battery for you. This is going to go. Like who wants to play a game for 25 minutes?
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.540]   Like this will go for four hours. It's great gaming is hot again. I mean, Netflix is an
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.180]   as they're going to stream games as an Netflix subscriber, you'll get to play games. Of course,
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.900]   Google Stadia X cloud. And I don't think Netflix has said that they're going to stream games.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.260]   They just that they just hired somebody that's going to manage game development. So they those
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.980]   apps may be a couple of things. One is those apps may be self contained. They may just be
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.980]   something that you play that you download as part of Netflix or as part of an other thing. They
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.580]   don't have to necessarily stream them even though they're a streaming company. And most likely a
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.900]   lot of that content will be interactive content that is related to their products.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.780]   Oh, interesting. Yeah. Like why not? Why not just have your own game platform that is going to
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:52.340]   build games around the IP that you're already creating? So something is popular and it probably
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.980]   wouldn't be like, oh, if something you know is going to be popular, like the Witcher, you might
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:03.220]   go, they know the first time, but by the second season, they can have a Witcher game come out
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.380]   at the same time as the next season. It'd be really, really interesting thing to do.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.900]   Yeah. And like you said last week, it's non trivial to stream this stuff. And very few
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.540]   companies have the infrastructure to do it well. Like you're talking like the Googles and the
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.020]   Microsofts and if Netflix is really confident in their streaming, it's just adding games, adding
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.700]   another whole revenue stream for them. Yeah, it doesn't again, it doesn't be streaming games
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.580]   either. It just lets you download the games and play them inside the environment. Sorry.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.820]   Yeah, I just assume because they're a streaming company that they would do what Google and
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:37.780]   Microsoft and others are so low latency streaming and latency streaming is like the what they do,
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:45.460]   they don't stream like Netflix doesn't stream. They provide an HLS feed that you watch at a
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:51.060]   delay of, you know, it takes a little time for it to build up. It's not two ways that it's not
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:57.620]   back and forth. It's one way, really. So yeah, that's like measured in milliseconds is really
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.740]   unforgiving, you know, and it probably would not be the best solution for Netflix across their
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.460]   entire user base. What would be way better for them is exactly what Apple's done, which is let
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.860]   you download the apps, you know, and let you play them inside the environment is going to be way
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:17.220]   better for overall for the overall audience. You'd dash my dreams, but yeah, but it's it.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.100]   We still have still just as great. We still have but g force now. We still have Microsoft
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:27.220]   6 cloud. I mean, they're still streamers. You don't know. Again, I think that flicks do it too.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.380]   I think that that they they again, it'll probably more likely to be interactive
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.180]   interactive experiences that you get to tour. For instance, there's things that you can't do
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:42.180]   right now in Netflix, which is like they could be doing photogrammetry or 360s of the of the
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.420]   locations while they're shooting all of the stuff and you could go and explore that. So there
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.740]   one piece of product might be a bunch of things that you can explore. You can play with the objects
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.860]   that they were holding. You can see other other bits of piece. Netflix has been really far behind
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.340]   in that area actually without having extras and all kinds of other things connected to the content.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.700]   I mean, the reason that I buy stuff from Apple is because of the extras, you know, and so which
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.940]   we don't get if I get them almost anywhere else. The other winner with the Steam Deck, of course,
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:17.220]   is AMD. They're going to use an AMD processor, an APU, they call it, which is both CPU and GPU.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.780]   Like an SOC. Yeah, and very powerful too. Also, they're using very, very fast
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:29.300]   quad channel 32-bit DDR5 RAM. So they're going to make a nice bit of kit as...
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.900]   It's a noise pickage. Somebody would say. I don't know.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:38.180]   I still piece of kit. But now onto the Apple. I don't know how we got onto that.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:43.220]   Actually, you want Apple to make one. That's why we want Apple to make exactly this one.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.340]   Well, that's the interesting thing. I mean, Apple does, I guess, with the iPad. I mean,
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:52.500]   that really is for many a game yet device, isn't it? I was walking down the aisles of the
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:16:00.260]   jam-packed 777 airplane on the way home from Hawaii and a lot of iPads and mostly games.
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:07.220]   All-paying candy crush, right? Yeah. You're pretty much... Roblox. Roblox and kids go together.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:13.140]   And the Apple TV, my son plays a lot on the Apple TV and a lot of the games are actually
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.380]   pretty fun. I get hooked into them. And now that you're starting to see Apple going,
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:23.380]   hiring away, not hiring, but commissioning like Kingdom Russia, I think, which is my favorite game,
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:31.940]   is now I think there's a new version of that that is on... That's now on the Apple games or
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:38.820]   whatever they call it. Arcade. That arcade thing. So what they obviously did is paid the same company
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:44.180]   to build something for them inside of that platform as well as whatever they're selling on the
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.140]   app. They're doing more exclusive stuff. They've announced now that Tetris Beat will be coming out,
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:54.500]   which is a game of Tetris kind of mixed with Guitar Hero where you do it or Beat Saber, maybe you
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.820]   do it to the beat of the music. I'd pay money for just a regular Tetris that just didn't do
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:04.260]   anything else, but the old Tetris. I mean, they came out, they licensed it to somebody and they
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:10.980]   came out with this just crazy Tetris that was like, "I just want the game that I used to play,
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.020]   and that I used to like to play and maybe make the graphics a little bit tighter, but I don't
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.180]   need it to be any more complicated than that. And everyone keeps on wanting to like, "How do we
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.740]   up Tetris?" Well, maybe we just... It would be great to have a version somewhere that someone
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.060]   could use that was just Tetris, because the licensing is so tight that we haven't been able to
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:33.140]   see it anywhere else. You can play it online Tetris.com. I don't know what that's to do.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:38.100]   It's like on your phone just seems like it seems like the perfect thing because he's just tap tap tap tap tap
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.380]   They even have the Russian music yeah
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.540]   Yo
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:51.520]   Okay, you'll see me later on this show
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:59.300]   I can't I agree with you so
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.620]   I'm glad that they have an idea that they have ideas for reimagining classic games, but
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:12.840]   And right in the mix Pac-Man should not necessarily be like a free world rumor where the words that I agree
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.120]   Know what your strengths are yeah
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.120]   Yeah, I mean I would love I would love for them to take a bit graphics and make them cooler
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.060]   But have all the same you know I was playing I got the Atari
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.240]   2600 you know thing that Tari sells and and the
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.320]   Please space invaders I was totally happy with mechanics of it
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.240]   My holy my my my only thing I mean that the joystick isn't as good as the old one, but but the
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.000]   But the I thought it would be fun to make them really high-res graphics for fun
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.800]   You know like to have a version of it that that that skins it
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.960]   But I wanted to do exactly what it was doing before it was working just fine
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.240]   I bought up on the Nintendo switch you can buy the classic games like this original Pac-Man
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.640]   Yeah, but they didn't even bother to size it so
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:02.640]   It's this big on the screen because they didn't do anything. It's point. It's dot for dot the same
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.040]   I mean I guess that's what some people want they call it to their credit the Nintendo Museum
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.440]   So I guess we know
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.960]   So angry Leo you're right so you're right nurse it be so angry right you're right okay
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.720]   How about we compromise we have like space invaders and it is like pixel accurate to like the original release
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.480]   But after each level there's like a six-minute cinematic cutscene
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:32.880]   All them with like unreal engine the back story. Yeah, it's always wanted to know how did they get there?
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.120]   Let's take you know
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.040]   I coming up
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.120]   Actually the big Apple story of the week
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.360]   Yeah, the big Apple story of the week this week is
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.200]   NSO
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.200]   spyware and I mentioned nice that
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.040]   iOS 4.7 came out
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.440]   today and
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.920]   Apple says it's to support the new battery pack the magsafe battery pack
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:04.280]   But I suspect it also might have something to do we don't know yet, but with breaking this NSO spyware hack
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.960]   Which is a zero-click hack that worked right up to we don't know if it'll work on 4.7
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.200]   But continue to work on all versions or 14 7 on all versions of iOS up to this point
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.640]   big story from
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:27.360]   Amnesty International which discovered how many people 50,000 phone numbers of surveillance targets
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.360]   obtained by
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   Forbidden stories at Amnesty International
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.240]   The Guardian and the Washington Post had the details
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:42.920]   Researchers analyzed the phones of dozens of victims to confirm that they did in fact have NSO's
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.080]   Pegasus spyware on them in fact
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:55.760]   They've now released a tool you can use to see if you have Pegasus spyware you probably don't unless you are a
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:02.880]   Target it's called the mobile verification toolkit and it's on github as mv
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.680]   T did you immediately run that line of a
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:14.520]   I didn't run it. I went through the process of looking at it and thankfully it's much easier on iOS than it is on Android
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:22.200]   I'm not so confident that Apple will have patched the bug now only because it looks like the project Pegasus chose
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.680]   Not to disclose to Apple or Google until they were about ready to publish
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   Which I can understand maybe if they thought it would be a bigger impact, but personally I would have liked them to have disclosed
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.840]   Yeah, before they said yeah
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.800]   We told Apple about this book and they fixed it so now let us tell you all about it
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.440]   I really don't like like the spectacle of this being in the wild and everybody panicking over it
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   Just quickly that's the difference between a news organization and basically anybody else
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:58.160]   They have a responsibility to get the information out as soon as possible if Apple were to come back and say we're
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.160]   working forever
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   Well, it's it there's a lot of details that we're trying to sift through
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   I don't think they
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.160]   I don't think they
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.440]   What basis I'm not challenging, but I'm what basis do you say that they took forever?
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:16.360]   Maybe they gave it off to researchers to look into they got they got like the University of Toronto to confirm their findings
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.920]   I could have been Apple and Google working on the same timeline
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   Because it doesn't get as much it's not going to get as many clicks if it was already fixed. I mean, let's be clear
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.640]   No, I disagree. That's not why they held on to this
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:36.120]   This first of all, they said it's your privacy reasons people who held on to where amnesty international and the forbidden project not
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.680]   Washington Post and the Guardian they didn't get that information and as soon as they can talk about the bullshit
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:47.080]   No, I'm sure that they don't think that the the amnesty international was looking for clicks. Oh, okay
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.120]   I am very troubled that it wasn't disclosed or I'll go that far
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.800]   I'll say I'm very troubled. I was disclosed earlier because it puts people at risk for
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:04.840]   Like they said it's privacy reasons that this was sensitive information, but they're publishing it like Apple and Google have nothing else have proven that a security departments can keep a secret
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.680]   At least as well as the wall street as Washington Post and the University of Toronto can keep these things secret
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:17.400]   So I don't I don't accept the rationales as presented and it does irk me that this was left in the wild longer than it absolutely had to be
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:25.640]   Um, okay researchers have documented iPhone. This is Washington Post iPhone infections with pegasus dozens of times
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   in recent years
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:33.400]   So this is not this is not an ex this is not what they revealed. They didn't reveal an exploit
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.520]   They revealed how the nso group has been using it and get and selling it to
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.480]   people like uh, Hungarian
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:47.720]   Prime minister or ban to use is against political enemies. So the x-point change
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.720]   Yeah, but pegasus continues, but the exploits keep changing whenever they're found
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:58.440]   Here's one from december 2020 journalist hacked was suspected nso group my message zero click exploit
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.200]   um
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   I I think
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.520]   I don't think so much this was the revelation that there was a new exploit
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.480]   This was the revelation of how the nso group has been selling it
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:15.320]   Though the customers yeah, but I if they if they burned more exploits not to spend more millions of dollars
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:21.160]   And amazon now we shut them down their structure infrastructure down for that they were using to stage all of this
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.960]   I think there's a lot that can be done too. I mean
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.360]   I think the timing of it coming out is is problematic the
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.840]   Fact that it came out the fact that they did the research the fact that they got involved with the press
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   Puts an enormous amount of pressure on nso and it was a great. It's a great service that they did
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.440]   I think that they just could have
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.240]   Been a little bit more they could have done a little bit more as far as the timing goes
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.560]   But I think that what they did is fantastic, you know like that that they that they went through that trouble
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.760]   There's no there's no question why mc your national was involved in both so eager about this because
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.040]   People legitimately get killed over this kind of state sponsors surveillance like this
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.840]   And the problem one of the great problems is that you have companies
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.480]   Creating these tools and then just simply selling them to whomever
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:13.560]   Whereas if you if you if you design certain weapons of that kind of a scale that are conventional weapons there are
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.840]   international interventions against and that
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.360]   Any reason for the reasons why
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.480]   There are reasons why that the a lot of these other tools so a lot of actual convention well
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.680]   But conventional weapons are tightly controlled. I thought was very very interesting. I think just a few weeks ago
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:35.240]   France decided to charge a french
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.200]   digital surveillance company with
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.920]   With crimes against humanity or at least excuse me
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.080]   present a case to a tribunal to see whether
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:54.120]   Two specific executives of this company should be put on trial for trial for crime against humanity because they knowingly sold their software
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.280]   So I think it was egypt and libya
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.840]   Knowing for a fact that knowing exactly what they're going to be used for that there was going to be used for kidnapping
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.280]   It's going to be used for torture is going to be used for killing and I think that this is this really ups the stakes on companies like
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:11.560]   Companies like this one saying that okay. Well look the free the free ride is no longer is
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.800]   Is is soon going to be over with if you sell tools
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.880]   that are being used to
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.400]   Not simply harass but again cause torture and murder
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:26.280]   You are going to be held accountable for that you're going to have to know who you're selling to and you're going to have to make sure that
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:32.760]   Whatever sales you make are done under acable applicable treaties and applicable international regulations
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:39.320]   They claim they are like they claim that they only sell to governments that don't do this that the Israeli government oversees all of their transactions
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.720]   But that doesn't seem to jive with the evidence that amsonians international is presenting
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.520]   And they also say that they're not responsible like they don't oversee the use of the software after they sell it
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:53.720]   And they don't have to access regular access to data which i don't know if that means if you're regular access to data
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.800]   She thought this shows the front of the end say
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.760]   He was of course murdered
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.240]   by
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.240]   We think the soutied government
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.320]   She was using an iphone she says because
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.200]   She said i thought it was safer
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.520]   Her phone was among the 23 found to have
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:19.160]   Forensic evidence of a successful pegasus intrusion the infiltration happened in the days after kashogi was killed in october 2018
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.960]   So the nso said oh
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.080]   Our technology was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of kashogi
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.440]   Well, they're not the only ones providing these services
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.320]   Go ahead and we'll be able to prove it if that's true. Yeah, exactly i
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.640]   But they're not the only they're not the only ones doing this including our own government
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:47.160]   It doesn't need to buy it from them. So you know, so are you saying that others have pegasus besides the nso group
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.800]   Not pegasus. Well, this was pegasus
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.520]   I'm saying others have similar this was pegasus
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.280]   All right
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.760]   So this is from the nso group this was pegasus. Oh, there was pegasus that was on kashogi
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:04.520]   Okay, kashogi's fiancé's phone so it was the nso group unless somebody else has pegasus
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.120]   But what the nso group doesn't have control. So what you do is you ask you ask a country
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:15.240]   At john's top and says they can't make iMessage safe. I'm not saying it can't be fixed
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.920]   But it's pretty bad
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.600]   Matthew green is very highly if someone was that much money like if a nation state
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.440]   It's the same thing if someone has physical access to your device or someone with the resources of a nation state
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.440]   This is not physical access
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.000]   No, no
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.760]   But i'm saying is like those are the two things like if someone has physical access or there's a nation state that is willing to put their resources
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.440]   Behind getting you it is almost impossible just because there's no perfect
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:42.360]   Code anymore and all of these things the exploits apple will bid against exploits up to a million dollars
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.960]   But there are people who will pay way more than that for exploits and there are people who are willing to give them to them
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:53.080]   And it's just the most possible folks bill marzak who's a fellow at citizen lab up at
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.400]   Toronto's monk school where where they did part of this investigation
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:02.600]   He says your phone your iphone and a billion other apple devices out of the box automatically run
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:11.080]   Famously insecure software to preview iMessage's whether you trust the sender or not any computer security one-on-one student could spot the flaw here
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.480]   And that's and that's not true
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:21.000]   I mean, no that I mean like you can find another other experts who say like like what's happened signal and all the
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.880]   These are really well-hardened but there are ways to get through them and apples made blast or and they've put a lot of
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:31.160]   What he's saying is but there is no way to get through them the preview is the problem
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:36.840]   That's not true anymore because it's previewed in blast or like I think he's got he's giving you an outdated as far as I can tell
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.720]   He's giving you that certainly that was the point of blast or wasn't it and there are other things you can you can deny
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:48.440]   Text but you something you have to flip a switch for and if you are the people who are at risk here are people who should know that they're
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.400]   That they're they have attention to state actors
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:58.040]   You know, you know, they're not this isn't just random people that are that are getting hit with this. I mean it could be abused
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:02.680]   But what I'm saying is it fiance who did not consider herself a target
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:08.120]   But was in fact concerned enough to use an iphone because she trusted apples marketing message
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:14.440]   And it's non-trivial too like i-iphones will typically a lot of these exploits do not survive a reboot on an iphone
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.760]   It's why people who are paranoid like me reboot our iphones
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.720]   It's very hard to get a persistent exploit anyone who's tried to jailbreak knows the hoops you have to jump through
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.520]   So these are often multi-prong attacks and they found evidence of unsuccessful attempts at getting this
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.160]   Which maybe means you have to reboot and then they have to give it to you again
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.960]   And sometimes they trick you to go to a website to do other you know other attack vector exploits
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:42.840]   It is a really really sophisticated million-dollar funded operation. I mean when when you're talking about, you know, people being able to hack
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:52.760]   Solar wins for what it does and and a lot of these things the attention that wants a state actor, you know points towards some something
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.920]   You know, there's the this one is one that's available to smaller countries
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:02.520]   You know, but the bigger countries the you know, the top you know, the top countries have the software themselves like they don't need they don't know
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.640]   You know, I mean, you know, they're not they don't need the they don't need the service to do Pegasus
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.400]   You know and so and the thing is is that is that if you are I mean
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.840]   I have worked in environments where I was probably a tart a potential target of state actors
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:22.280]   And you you completely change all the molecules of what you do, you know when you do that, you know
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.800]   And and you you you operate with your phone you have a separate phone from that you don't have messages you have signal
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.000]   And even then you're careful of everything that you do, you know with it you consider your phone as a
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.080]   huge risk factor to what you what you're doing, you know, and
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:44.680]   You know, and so those are things that you have to take into account and and and you consider that every every that everybody around you is at risk
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.640]   You know when you're in that environment, you know that and and you pay attention to emails that you get from them
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.240]   You pay attention to texts that you get from them you pay attention to all of those things
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.400]   You know, it is when you talk to people who do red who are red shirts, you know, or
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.640]   Red teams
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.320]   You know when you ask them like
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.720]   Who's been able to stop you their answer is always never no one no one's able to stop them
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.800]   You know like eventually they'll get through and so we just have to be kind of you know
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.280]   You're absolutely right that the security has to get better
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.520]   But I think that a lot of that security needs to sit in preferences inside of the user
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.760]   Position where you don't want to give that to the the average person is not at risk
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.320]   Like you know the average person like we have this thing like we put out this big thing and everyone's gonna think that
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.440]   Okay now i'm not i'm not sure if i'm at risk or not you're the average person has a very very secure phone
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.480]   um, you know that that is more secure than
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.800]   you know when they were
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   A thousand other ways that they could have been tracked before
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:43.960]   um and if you put your if you start doing things where you're kicking open doors you need to
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:50.280]   Literally change everything about how you work and everyone around you like you just have to know that that's that is the cost of doing those things
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:56.360]   And and and that that comes with the territory or it should it should be seen as what comes with the territory
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.920]   so and and and I think that
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.840]   Uh, you know now people that know about it
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.240]   They'll hopefully take more more precautions in those areas and I I will assume that you know
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   This is a cat and mouse that apple and google and
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:12.520]   Signal and everyone else are constantly, you know constantly closing up whatever just open
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:17.800]   But you have to always weigh convenience versus security and you decide what's best for most people that are just gonna
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.840]   The average person is going to do it that doesn't need this but you do need the tools
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.040]   To say I don't want to you know, I want to close all this stuff down
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.400]   Um, and that's what that's why I think is still missing somewhat somewhat
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.120]   But there are things in your phone if you if you say i'm not going to take any messages from an unknown
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:37.960]   Um collar or any phone calls it'll do that but now you miss a bunch of calls and people saying
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.120]   You know your bank sends you uh check to see if your your set your credit card isn't
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.480]   Uh, is you did you actually make that charge and then they close your credit card because you didn't respond because you had blocked all those things
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.880]   And people are upset and they yeah, I mean, but then they get upset and they and they you know
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.960]   And so you have to kind of there's a lot of this that you have to weigh back and forth
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.920]   It's not gonna it's not a you know, it's not a pristine solution
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.360]   according to what happens when these tools become
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.200]   Not under the control of a security company
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:12.920]   But these the basic the basic tools the basic hacks become more of a commercial entity kind of like how
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.240]   Uh, there are there are a bunch of organizations that repackage
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.600]   Uh ransomware software. So what happens when this because what happens when this becomes
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:29.720]   Uh a tool that's being used by people who are stalking an expos what happens when it's it's a tool for someone who is
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:37.240]   Unhinged and they want to get revenge against a workplace that they feel so they've been unfairly fired from and this is this is the source
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.280]   I I absolutely agree with you that this should not be used as a vector to get everybody just to
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.200]   Throw away their their smartphones and go back to something with a dial on it
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:51.960]   But nonetheless every time the lens every time the landscape changes in terms of the threats that are
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:59.160]   Proposed by the presence of a smartphone in your pocket that information has to get out people have to have the ability to make
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.720]   decision about about
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.760]   What they're trusting and what they're not trusting you have to at least be aware
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.480]   Even if they even if they even if here in new england
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.920]   We know that it's very very unlikely that we'll have an earthquake that'll affect us
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:16.360]   We have to know when we move into a brick house that actually there have been there have been earthquakes
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:22.920]   As close as 28 miles away from there and the strongest has been if the epicenter had been moved over
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.040]   This would have been pretty bad for this town specifically
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.560]   the the
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.360]   I completely agree with you that we need to know about it and and we need it and I would prefer that none of this existed
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.720]   but it's also why
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.760]   That I mean I I think that everybody needs to know about that
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.760]   You know and I think that that's why when we get into conversations about fragmenting
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.840]   You know like while apple can't stop it now
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:49.960]   Fragmenting the the the the OS by allowing external stores and external things and all these other things the reason I'm so
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:55.720]   That I'm so touchy about it and I create I get on a on a soapbox and I start going we can't let this happen
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:01.240]   Is because it makes it harder to fix that like you're you're you're talking about making it harder to fix
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.040]   When you start opening you start fragmenting they can't stop it
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.320]   They haven't stopped it now, but it's a lot easier when they own everything around it
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.720]   Then they're building those chips and they're tightening everything up
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:15.000]   And they're getting rid of all these they're they're slowly carving out and closing up all the things that are there
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.080]   And as an apple user I want them to continue to do that because I understand those risks
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.440]   And I think that everybody needs to understand those risks that everyone is at risk
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.800]   And the chances of stopping this is every one of every so really
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.600]   They're at risk if we you just said these are
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.240]   highly targeted expensive
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.840]   nation-state attacks
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.400]   Yeah, but I mean you want to be able to continue to close it up
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:41.080]   Well, I guess I'm wondering what I'm saying is that you should be off for a phone for people who are targets and then
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.440]   a little more open phone for people who aren't targets. I mean
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.400]   There's no there's no there's no
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.400]   We should I don't need to adopt
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.080]   All of these security practices if I'm not a target
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:59.080]   Right, that's what there should be little dip switches in in your phone that say nope. Nope. Nope. No. No. No. No. No, no
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.600]   You know and and close all that stuff out. I don't think apples gonna do that, but okay
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:09.240]   They've already been in I'd be nice to have the choice. I have apple statement if you're interested in it. Yes
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.120]   Let me just ask before you do that. I do want to hear that
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:18.680]   Um, I don't think they published an exploit right this was not a revelation of how it was done
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.400]   This was just a revelation of that it was done
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:26.440]   And I think that's the difference it was both because they had they had the they had the the compromise
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.120]   They had all the data from the compromised phones and a bunch of the compromised phones
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.680]   But I don't think they knew how it was executed
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:38.440]   I may be wrong on this my sense is they were able to detect if it had been but effective
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:44.680]   But submitting but giving those phones to the to apple or google and letting them analyze them with the with the data as fast as possible
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.520]   Would have been really a lot of yeah
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.560]   It protects a lot of the people that they were talking about wanting to protect
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.960]   So if they take a long time to look at it the people to talk to about it are the companies who
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.480]   Can actually change the o s to fix it, but instead, you know, they they worked on a lot of other things and that's fine
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.400]   You know, that's I mean it
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.320]   It's it's good that it came out again
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:10.600]   The problem is is that they needed to give them the phone so that they can analyze those things if they were if they wanted to actually get it fixed quickly
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.000]   So what does apples say?
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.360]   So it was interesting to me is that it didn't come from apple pr came from evon kristic who is head of platform architect platform security architecture
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.800]   At apple the one the guy who's spoken at black hat several times super smart
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.040]   He created by frost and bit sorry bit frost and all of these systems
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.360]   He said apple unequivocally condemns cyber attacks against journalists human rights activists
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.840]   And others seeking to make the world a better place for over a decade apple has led the industry and security innovation
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:43.960]   As results security researchers agree the iphone is a safest most secure consumer mobile device on the market attacks like the ones described or highly sophisticated
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:49.080]   Cost millions of dollars to develop and often have a short shelf life and are used to target specific individuals
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.960]   Well, that means they are not a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:57.880]   We continue to work tirelessly to defend all our customers and we are constantly adding new protections for their devices and data
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.680]   Yeah, and presumably you should keep your iphone up as up today as possible
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:09.400]   But if you are a potential target of nation state hackers, you probably shouldn't be carrying a smartphone finished
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   You need offset
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.760]   What they let the president use and use that
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.360]   Maybe nothing. Yeah
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:28.040]   We have but we do have to worry about the the unknowns out there that you never know when you are when or for what reason that you might be
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:34.440]   You're you're going the contents of your phone and your your comings and going might be of interest to someone who wants to do you harm
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.320]   Sometimes that's a state sponsored act sometimes again
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.280]   It's just some crazy person who was leafletting your your town and notice that you took down one of their leaflets
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.040]   And so this is the sort of thing that could go the weaponization of this could
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.640]   Increase and scale very very easily. I mean for me the
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.000]   I absolutely understand
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.120]   Alex's reaction that this is why we have to be really really sensitive and careful about opening up stores
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.720]   on devices for me. My first reaction was this is
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.280]   doubly triply
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:11.800]   Underscoring why we should not allow any back doors into our device for for state security. This is why
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.040]   Every time that there's been a proposal that oh well, we can just give
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.440]   We can apple could just create a private key that's known only to law enforcement
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.720]   And that and that could decrypt the contents of this device
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:29.080]   Said no, there is no safe way to do that and this was before we had a really clear picture of again
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:35.160]   We I think a lot of us can easily imagine oh well someone with the resources of a huge comp huge industrial
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.520]   Country can certainly afford to grip break into any phones of interest. It's when you well
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.200]   I've got a PayPal account. I've got the I've got this website that says that
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   For for $8,000 they'll give they'll give me and a list of phone numbers. They will provision
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:57.480]   A whole bunch of tools that will break into these phones for you. That's the that's the real scary things that and we that's why in principle
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.960]   We have to fight those kinds of incursions that kind of
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:06.600]   Government based oh with free-owned privacy for the to to fight terrorism. We have to weaken the security of your phone
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:12.280]   I'm not afraid of governments as much as I'm afraid of again that person five years from now that will sell for $8,000
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:17.320]   Just an unlock for anybody's phone. Well, you're not afraid of governments because you live in the us
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.520]   But if you lose a Saudi Arabia, right? No, I'm like well be afraid
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.320]   Do anything you don't like they don't like because no
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:33.480]   The of a man of interest I think nobody questions at google and apple both
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:40.120]   Would love to stop this cold there and they're doing everything they possibly can't there's no question about that
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   Um, I think this story was really important. I think amnesty international prison stories did a very very good job
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.440]   Because I think the people we have to really
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:55.240]   Put pressure on is the nso group and people like that who do make these exploits search for these exploits find them
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:59.800]   And then sell them they don't you know the people who didn't reveal this to apple
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.800]   Znso group because they could make a lot of money selling it to governments
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.440]   That's they maintain they stop terrorists and they stop sex and drug traffickers
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:14.840]   But they it doesn't seem like they do their cyber job of checking the cyber licenses of all the people who are coming to buy
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:20.040]   Cyber web. I mean I think they're as full people as the nation states that but the hard part
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:25.480]   We can we can try to do it publicly the hard part with with nso is is that is that everybody's hand is in the till
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.600]   Like all the governments like all of their hands are in the till
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:34.360]   Government wants this and so there's not absolutely so we can try to do that, but it's a people wanted to stop not the governments
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.960]   Yeah, it's just
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.560]   This is where the will of the people in the will of the governments may not may not line up 100
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.200]   And so so I think that that's why it's important that we make sure that we empower
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.120]   Companies like apple and google to do whatever they need to do to close the close their system down
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:53.720]   And when we talk about like not allowing security we need to always consider that to be one of the top things that
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:59.160]   That a phone company can do but when and but that is why when when I suddenly take this hard turn and say
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.240]   You know, we can't fragment the market
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:05.880]   It's because it makes it harder to secure the phone like that is the thing that I'm most concerned about is
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:10.280]   Making it harder to secure the phone, you know, and which I which I think is very very important
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.520]   I don't know if there's evidence of that because these hacks still happen all the time
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:19.560]   And they're still gonna happen everything's gonna be a lot easier for apple to close the million dollars and not a thousand dollars
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:27.320]   It would it would be it would be lovely if there were just like just like gatekeeper on the mac has different settings saying that okay
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:34.600]   Well, you can either make this the wild west you can install any app you want or we will limit just developers that inside or outside
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.200]   The app store have lume themselves known to us or we can lock your your phone down
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.400]   So it only gets stuff from the from the app store one two three different settings
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:47.480]   It would be wonderful if one of the long-term results of this is that you would expect that from every phone that's saying that look
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:54.280]   There are three settings we can and basically they're they are in opposite the security your phone and the level of pain
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.480]   You're going to experience are and on opposite trajectories here
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.440]   So if you want to if you are in a situation where you feel as though I don't want to take any risks whatsoever
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:08.600]   I'm willing to feel the pain and reduce my phone to something that can basically just receive texts from people
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.000]   I know and make make and receive phone calls from people I know all the way up to okay
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.720]   I feel as though I'm not I'm not at risk
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.880]   Please just get me like the the basic security I would find in Iowa's 14
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:24.600]   That would be wonderful when a side story that we're not going to because I'm sure because it's not
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.320]   It's not related to mac but
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.200]   There was some some team
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.680]   Bitcoin
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:38.280]   So really millionaire I've gotten to hop until a lot of press but oh I'm offering the freedom phone
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:45.320]   And it's it's it protects you from protects your freedom and it's not made but don't you have to don't trust the big companies google
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.040]   An apple and well, yeah, but you're basically taking a phone off of alibaba
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:55.240]   You're putting aliexpress. You're putting all kinds of software on it. That is not checked not tested
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.600]   Where that which caused me to have to refresh my knowledge about well if I wanted to get a really really 100
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.960]   Cent secure phone
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.240]   What would I have to do to make that happen and once again again?
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:10.280]   You can make that happen, but the pain threshold of locking down your phone against as many
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.760]   Practical threats as can be combated on this device
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.280]   You are you will have a phone with very very limited capability
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.600]   But again some people they would like they would like to have that phone in a desk drawer somewhere
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.720]   And when they're about to go to china or they're about to go to turqueter or if they are about to like aliex
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:33.560]   Be start working on a contract that might cause because people to take attention to what they're doing
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:38.200]   guess what my my my pixel phone my iPhone they go into the drawer the
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:42.360]   The black box phone comes out of the drawer and again
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:48.040]   If I have to get my my eight-year-old camera eight-year-old like nicon pocket camera
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.160]   Out of storage so I can suppose I can continue to take pictures
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:58.760]   My daily my daily life that's what's going to have to happen because the threat to my life the threat to my coworkers is too great
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.960]   Yeah, I used to think that too. I think that gatekeeper would be a really good solution for iOS
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.960]   But I'm rethinking that a lot lately
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:11.240]   For two main reasons one is that a lot of the stuff that people say they want gatekeeper before like VPN apps in china
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.320]   Still wouldn't work because trying to just blocks the server
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.480]   But the other thing is the amount of social engineering that goes on around gatekeeper like features
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:22.280]   And some of it is personal like kids are like oh, I want to get pokemon go before it comes out or I want to get fortnight when
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.560]   It's not available on the app store
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.920]   So I'm just going to go on the internet and find out the instructions and they turn that stuff off
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.240]   And it's not always turned back on or they they end up downloading a version of the app that's not real it
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:34.120]   Or like school say you have to install this software to do
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.680]   scrutinizing for your
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:40.920]   For your tests and you have no choice you just have to put it on or a company decides it doesn't want to be bothered
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.960]   Like facebook doesn't want to be bothered by the app store or by the enterprise license
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:49.400]   So they do it and I think there is some consumer benefit to having a device that is much harder to socially engineer
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.560]   That's just not an option where you can say that you know if I want that i'm going to buy an android phone
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.360]   And if I want to make sure I can't be tricked bamboozled
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:01.080]   Intimidated forced coerced in any way to weaken the security of my device
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:06.120]   I want to have that as an option and right now we have those two options, but it remains we see and how long we have them for
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:12.520]   I agree if you're absolutely right. I mean your your knowledge of the inner workings of how these things go are so valuable to this conversation
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.880]   And so many others that we've had when I was when I was going after though is that
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.080]   People need to simply have again three
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.640]   Whatever happens behind the scenes they have to know that look here is
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.200]   easiest
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:31.640]   Most attractive to use phone least least secure relatively and most secure phone
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:37.480]   Biggest hassle and then someplace in the middle so that and make it difficult to switch between the two so that you're not faced
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:42.040]   With the problem of the user doesn't have to face the problem of okay. Well, I'm going to have to
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:49.480]   Allow use of this protocol inside iMessage or I'm going to have to approve the use of sms as a messaging platform
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:56.360]   No, just make all this stuff buried up very very behind a setting so that users can get the greatest benefit from it without having to really
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.760]   Figure out exactly what these things do. We're already trusting
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.040]   As we can I should also go in I should also point out that
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:07.640]   There's no evidence at all that these and that android phones were any more susceptible to this than iphones
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:12.600]   So it will be a bridge to have that switch and do allow you to sideload
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.160]   But that's not how these attacks are happening
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:21.720]   But it's so much it's so much it's coming like we don't know that number one is we don't know how much how many code hours was spent on android
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:28.360]   Versus versus the iphone to get through all those things and how easy it will be for apple to close that down because it's already so closed
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.360]   Android is hopelessly fragmented
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.840]   There's no way that you can secure these in the android phones
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.240]   And so the thing is is that is that the the iphone is going to it has it has holes
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.200]   But the holes are much smaller and there's much fewer of them
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.280]   Because you know and so the thing so I just agree there's no evidence of that
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:52.520]   By the way, the phrase is just announced. It's investigating a report the morocco had their president Emmanuel macron's phone tapped
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.360]   Using you know, spyware phones in france developed by
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.640]   Yeah, this was back in 2019
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.520]   Those are those aren't
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.640]   That's an intelligence agency from one country
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:10.520]   Loning it to another country a lot of times, you know, like they just you know, we'll get you in there
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.080]   You know, this is this is a very common thing for intelligence agencies to do is they're not allowed to do it
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.760]   But they can get somebody else to do it for them
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.080]   So someone else has that contract with nso
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.080]   And then they go well, can you get me through it and they're and they're making a trade for some other piece of
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.800]   intelligence information
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.240]   Uh moving on
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.600]   I'm on a breath. That was a great conversation
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.200]   I need a protein bar or something
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:41.640]   Actually interestingly apple is catching up on and right in the united states. It was
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:50.760]   In days gone by the case that and right had maybe as much as 70 of market share it is now 50 50
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.480]   and uh according to the
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:58.360]   Analysts at syrp the consumer research intelligence partners
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.600]   The reason is uh iphone users are more loyal
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:09.000]   Uh, it looked like the iphone loyl were becoming more loyal because it was it was like android is at 93
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.640]   That's right and iphones have now gone up to 93. That's actually right. They're becoming more loyal
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:19.560]   So they're now equally loyal, which is bizarre you'd think iphone owners would be more loyal than android owners
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:24.520]   I think that there's there's a lot of value to both platforms for the people that have them
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:30.040]   Yeah, you know and so I think that they're you know people who want the flexibility that android provides is
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.680]   Something that they're not they're never going to get on the iphone
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.960]   So this is from the uh note in the most recent quarter apple had an edge in loylde
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:45.400]   With 93 percent of prior iphone owners upgrading to an iphone compared to 88 percent of android owners
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.960]   Staying it with and it's also actually this is upgrades, isn't it? This is buying a new phone
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.280]   And maybe that that iphone owners buy new phones more often i wouldn't be surprised
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:58.120]   But it's also different because you can move across android phones while and you're still on android
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.720]   Where if you want to move to something different the iphone by definition you're leaving the iphone
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.960]   Yeah, that's true. That's true
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:09.880]   Uh, but I think that's probably good news. I I never knew that I always assumed it was pretty much 50 50 all along
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.000]   But now it is amongst it was used to be
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.360]   Uh like as close to 50 50 in america, which is very different than the rest of the world as well as predominantly android
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:23.080]   But amongst american teenagers it was predominantly iphone, right, you know because of all the social factors to it
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.320]   Yeah, this is us these numbers
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:33.400]   And that is a very very significant change because when you think about the amount of flexibility that people have by going android's
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.560]   Particularly in price
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:42.360]   Uh the fact that uh apple is far from losing ground their gaining ground means that they are not only broadening their
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.040]   Broadening the net so to speak make it more available to more people
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:53.080]   But also continuing to press the advantage of if you have that if you if you have uh if you have 500 dollars to spend on a phone
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:59.080]   We can sell you a phone for 500 dollars and you will be more happy with our phone than you will be with anybody else's
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.360]   So that is that is a really really good statistic
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:08.520]   And I believe that android globally is still 73 oh, yeah, absolutely because because that's and also
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.000]   And also keep in mind that that's not
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.920]   70 it's not really an apples to apples sort of comparison
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:20.040]   Because when you talk about the the market share of android you're talking about every android device
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:27.800]   Including like blister packed or the cheapest phones available in the world running old old old versions of android that
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.360]   Basically are have no comparison to any version that was released two or three years ago
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:37.160]   So that's why it's it's still it's still a dominant o s by a huge factor
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:45.080]   But you really should it's it's a much smaller number as a practical thing in terms of people coming in wanting to get a modern smartphone
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:51.160]   And how many people have android phones that that fit that bill how many people have uh have uh iphones to fit that bill
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:59.640]   Interestingly lg which abandoned the uh android phone market very recently has decided to sell iphones in its stores
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.520]   Didn't take long
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.120]   They didn't wait until the body was the body wasn't even cold yet
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.760]   Building the phones was too much hassle. We just wanted the money and this was the easiest solution
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:17.960]   Samsung does have 67 percent of the south gree in the market share apple only 22 percent but lg had even
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.600]   Is it health care?
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:26.040]   Yeah, lg will make more money selling apple phones in korea than they ever sold their own phone. Oh for sure
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.600]   I think that's guaranteed. Yeah, that was probably probably part of the math. Yeah
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:35.320]   Uh, so maybe that maybe there'll be more people worldwide using iPhones
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.960]   Starting in south korea
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:44.520]   Our friend kyle weans of iFixit form sponsor very aggressively promoting a right to repair
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.600]   he says
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:54.520]   apple samsung and microsoft are monopolizing the supply chain and designing products to prevent users from een easily repairing them
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:57.240]   uh, he's talking to the
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.600]   productivity
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.720]   Commission
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:05.720]   During their virtual right to repair hearing on monday. I don't know who runs the productivity commission
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.600]   but
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:12.360]   Uh, he's he said apple is notorious for doing this with chips in their computers
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:18.200]   There's a particular charging chip on that he's talking about modifying the chips just ever so slightly so they can claim
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.120]   Proprietary there's a particular charging chip on the macbook pro
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:27.880]   There's a standard version of the part then there's the apple version of the part that sits very slightly tweaked
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.080]   But it's tweaked enough so that it's only required to work in this computer
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.000]   And that company is again under contractual agreement with apple and that's the key
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:39.160]   uh, these companies won't sell these parts to
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:44.120]   I think that there's this is there's a suggestion in here that they should label these as
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:48.520]   um better or worse to write to repair and i'm 100 behind that
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:52.600]   I think they should they should definitely let people know and then they should let the consumers decide what they want to buy
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:57.320]   I think telling them that they can or can't is is something that as a consumer i'm not that interested in
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:02.040]   Um, but as but I I think that people knowing how repairable their devices
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.800]   I think putting it in front of them putting a big sticker on the front. I think it's fine
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:11.400]   He gives an example of um apple having warehouses full of spare parts
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.480]   Uh once the seven year window for repairs ends
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:21.400]   They'll destroy the parts rather than selling them to the marketplace. He says so someone like me
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:26.760]   Who eagerly would have bought them they were paying the recycler to destroy them instead
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:32.200]   Uh, yeah, and I think it does great on repairability for sure. Yeah
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:37.880]   Um, but I think it's also kind of unconscionable for companies say after well, we don't repair it after seven years
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:41.400]   So we're just going to destroy all the spare parts so no one else can either
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:48.600]   100% I think apple can make and these other companies they can make very very good sound arguments about how hey look
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.200]   We can't like make
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:55.160]   Phones that are half an inch thick and hold together by screws that with all components that are like
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.960]   I sees that are in sockets you can pull them out
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.800]   But that's not what the right to repair is asking for they're simply saying that
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:09.640]   We want a level of repairability so that uh third party repair centers have an ability to uh extend the life of these products
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:14.360]   And the fact that apple is one of the companies that's a lot of re-lapping hard hard hard hard
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:19.800]   Against these rules which don't not only protect phone consumers. They protect
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:26.680]   Hoss medical medical communities using medical equipment. They've they affect farm equipment. They affect everybody who's driving a car
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.920]   The fact that they're underpinning
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:37.400]   A basic thing that could that does so much harm across so many sectors of society that to me is indefensible in france where they have now
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:41.720]   Mandated that that a repair index beyond
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:49.580]   The box so that people when they buy the device will know its repair ability this applies to smartphones laptops televisions
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:52.120]   washing machines and lawn mowers
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:56.040]   lawn mowers
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:03.480]   We should add the lawn mowers a recent samsung survey showed that 86 percent of french citizens say the index impacts their purchasing behavior
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.280]   While 80 said they would give up their favorite brand for a more repairable
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:13.720]   Product so yeah, I agree with you. Let's start labeling. That's a good idea. I think labeling. I think labeling is good
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.480]   I think that they I think that they're actually I think there actually are some valid reasons
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.920]   I mean, you know with
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:25.000]   The way that these things are packed together having random people but fixing them means that we know with a lot of different things
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:29.640]   It the reason that they're doing this. I don't I just don't think it's that big of a revenue stream for these companies
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:35.160]   It's a matter of their brand of when something catches fire on a plane or if something does something like that
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:39.000]   They don't have control over it. You know and and they don't you know, it's their brand that's being effective
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.840]   That's why they're fighting it. I think I don't think that I mean I just don't think I just don't believe that it's that big of a revenue stream for them
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.800]   I've realized I realized that this is a matter of opinion
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:54.680]   But for me, I think that it's it's not necessarily a common a thing where they want people to force to be used
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:58:00.520]   To use authorized service centers and authorized parts and maybe buying new phones or new new lawnmowers when they could
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.600]   Essentially fix what they've got. I think it comes down to it is way too much trouble
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.160]   We consider this to be way too much trouble for us as a company
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.920]   This doesn't make us any money
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:14.840]   So why would we invest any time money effort or or human staff power and in making this happen?
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.440]   And the answer to that is because you don't want to be a dreadful company
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:22.680]   Well, yeah, you don't have to investigate the motives of why a company's doing it. It doesn't matter
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:28.120]   Exactly. It's a better world would be if after seven years these devices were not thrown out
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.680]   But there was an opportunity to repair them. I think would be a great thing
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:36.120]   It's just I think it's just like companies are sometimes shortsighted about these things
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:40.840]   They don't see the benefits. I think you could put the pressure on Apple and they would go. Oh, yeah
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.280]   That's a silly policy. We're gonna stop destroying those perfectly good parts
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:48.680]   They have been slowly like they're slowly getting better at this but just not very fast and that's the hard part
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.920]   It's like they do like these little things where we're doing this this program where people can get more of this stuff
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:57.320]   And then you know everyone covers it and then it takes a year before it's in another country
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:01.480]   And then a year before another part is added. Yeah, so like they're coming around. It's just with no velocity
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.600]   So that's the main reason I bring it up. I'm not it's not to slay a gapple
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:09.320]   I'm there are good reasons why they do it and they're perhaps just out of inertia
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:13.240]   There's other reasons why they do it. I don't even care what their motives are. We want a better world
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.680]   We want better repairability. I think I think a label is great
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.440]   A label is great. Good start and don't destroy parts that are perfectly good
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:23.480]   Offer them to repair companies after the
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:31.000]   The French are really upset about it or they say that they are but but my chance the chances of people buying less
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   iPhones because of the label is probably pretty low
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.440]   Well, it's one percent got effective. It's got an Amazon that was
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:43.240]   Go ahead at Renee or Annie. No, I was gonna say that like Amazon was destroying all these products including Mac books that were at their warehouse
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:47.160]   And people couldn't believe it and they said yeah, well, we force the companies to stall to store them here
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:51.480]   So it's more convenient to ship but you know if they don't sell we're not gonna store them for free for them
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.440]   And they're not gonna pay us to store them and we have no legal right to give them away
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.280]   So we're just gonna destroy them and as always this super dumb bureaucracy
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:04.440]   And it's probably the same thing with these parts. It's just like who owns these parts who's supplying them is apple preloading them
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.560]   What's the ownership? What's the liability and so like the easiest thing is to destroy them and it's the dumbest thing at the same time
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.640]   Yeah, we just want to encourage
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.560]   Proper action think of the planet think of the planet
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:21.480]   And you know, I don't I have no doubt that apple does and cares and so this is they may be sensitive to this kind of well
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:25.480]   They have Lisa Jackson. She's a force of nature. We just ought to get her activated all these things
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:32.840]   Uh, by the way that they have uh according to uh, mark german. He's got the scute then apple has decided
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:38.840]   Thanks to covid spikes in our region the good old delta variant to delay the return to office
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.400]   by at least a month
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.560]   Uh, they were planning in september now they're saying october
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.080]   They're recommending workers at their stores wear masks
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:54.440]   And they said we will give employees at least a month's warning before mandating return to office
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.520]   We don't know when that will be
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.520]   Have we masks again? Yeah
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.920]   Have we talked about the most of the apple store event
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.800]   No, what masks do they wear at the apple store?
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.680]   I asked them. I was I was at the apple store and I asked them what mask I was like those are the nicest masks
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:14.360]   I've ever seen where do I get those? I literally asked them and they said, oh, we made them like apple made their own masks
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.800]   You know, they they're apple designed apple produced masks
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.880]   Um, and they are the nicest masks. I've ever seen, you know, um
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.320]   You know, if there's any if there's any argument on the importance of having your own reliable supply chain
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.800]   It's for emergency supplies like this and part of it had to do with all the wildfires that are happening
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.560]   regularly and
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:38.040]   Around apple that they realize they have to have a stop they have to be able to give all of their employees
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:45.160]   masks so they could breed outside safely and again the the ability that that's the one company that's going to have as much hand sanitizer
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.240]   as much, you know
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   As many mre's as much
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.000]   Pales of fresh water as they possibly need for any eventuality
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.120]   I have to say as somebody who just got off a four-hour flight having to wear a mask the whole time
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.000]   I'm a little disappointed
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.160]   Uh, we're actually trying to decide whether we should require masks in the inside we people came back to the office
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:13.560]   County doing it. Uh, the whole county where apple is recommending it. It's complicated. So
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.800]   Uh, you know remember the issue is vaccinated versus non vaccinated
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.560]   The calosha is not requiring it, but they're suggesting
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.800]   that uh
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   Non-vaccinated employees wear masks
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.440]   Um, we actually are saying you can't come inside unless you are vaccinated period
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:35.560]   Um, but but so a lot of these are masking like a lot of like india
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:39.480]   Not india, so israel I think is mandating mask even if you are vaccinated now because delta is just
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.600]   So problematic and for the people who aren't getting back
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.880]   We're the people who got vaccinated now have to wear masks to protect the people who didn't get vaccinated is basically where we are at this point in the
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.040]   In a movie. Yep. Yep
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.120]   But it means probably no september event right because if there was any chance that apple is going to look at that
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.480]   Maybe we can bring at least us media in for this
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.280]   If they're not reopening the office in september, they're definitely not having a live event september
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.280]   I don't see any reason why I mean they're I mean it they're
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:12.040]   They're probably not going to have any I would be surprised if they have anything until maybe
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.480]   Dubbed up dc next year. I'd be you know, there's not really any
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.280]   Well, if they listen to you, they'll never have another live event, right or they'll only have no there's limited
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:27.320]   There's really good reasons. I mean so wwc and is one of the few conferences that you know wc and f aid and google
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.720]   And build give you a lot of face time with it with the code, you know
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:36.440]   And they haven't fixed that yet the ability to do what they do on a whiteboard the ability to do what they have
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.040]   I mean they've gotten much better at it
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.720]   And there's a lot of people that really you know that i've talked to some developers that got
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.520]   Some of the one-on-ones from this last wwc and they they said they'd rather have that than go
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.160]   Um because they really had that now a lot of that's available
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.240]   I mean you have to get in line, but a lot of that's available to people
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.360]   You know all year round from apple, but but the
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.440]   Uh, there are a lot of good reasons to have a physical event like dub wc
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.640]   There's not a lot of good reasons to have the presentations. That's the only thing I think that they they can get rid of
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.280]   Is they just need videos of those presentations because they actually they're more viewable
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.320]   They sound better. They look better. They're faster
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:17.400]   They're better. They're better, especially as an evergreen product of you're gonna go back and look because I look back on stuff on hls
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:24.920]   Six years after it was done to figure something out and and I and I now especially I was just doing this with hls
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.960]   I was like watching everything because we were dealing with some issue and and
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.480]   Um
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.800]   When we got to the new ones that were recorded, I was like, oh what a breath of fresh air
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.720]   It just is so much easier to watch and and I think that the keynotes are way easier to watch
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:43.480]   Um, you know for for the user without the stage. I do think that there are reasons to have physical events
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:46.120]   It's just that it's not to present something, you know
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.440]   Like that's not a valid reason to do that
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:52.920]   I think that there's a reason to bring the press in because you want them to touch the stuff and talk to the apple folks
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.880]   But they don't need to that doesn't mean you need to do a presentation. They can just watch a big move
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.920]   There will be no touching for a long time. I predict
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:04.040]   No hugs no touching. You know, it was so sad. It was going to miss his annual hugs
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.560]   I felt for him
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:12.920]   Hey, here's a well, let's take a break, but then in a second a question about security and apple being posed
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.640]   by google
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.480]   Uh, you're watching back break weekly or you're listening and a naco rene richy
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.480]   Alex lindsey
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:27.000]   Uh, google's been pushing rcs the rich communication system to replace
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.920]   sms
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:34.200]   partly because they say it's more secure and they're encouraging apple to join the
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:42.440]   Small short parade of carriers moving over to rcs for rizans going to join at and t and t mobile
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:48.520]   In preloading android messages android messages google's messaging app and android uses rcs
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.320]   And the problem they say with iMessage is that it falls back to sms
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:57.320]   If you're messaging somebody who's on an android device or any non apple device
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:03.720]   It'll fall back because there's no iMessage. It'll fall back to sms google says sms is not secure
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.240]   We know that rcs is it's encrypted by default
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.560]   um
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.840]   They they very much would like apple to go along you agree
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:18.200]   I agree that they want them to
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.400]   I think i'd be
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.560]   It's not a google standard. I mean google seems to be the one pushing it
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.280]   But um, but it's been such a not like it's been such a start stop off on thing
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:36.760]   Like it's just been the one of the most painful rollouts to good point ever witness apple may look at the carrying strategy overall and say
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.600]   Yeah
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.760]   We'll get back i'll blame google i blame the carriers
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.000]   They're like they they don't like they're famously like the railroads wanted to make all their tracks different lens
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   So you couldn't go from one to the other that's right
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.640]   uh
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:57.560]   I just getting to getting to the apples advantage is that it's a totally vertical stack. Why would they unstack that?
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.120]   I don't know
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:04.600]   We're getting now unencrypted in fact very insecure sms messages
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:09.320]   It would be nice on the iphone because we're getting those like when those messages fail over from my message
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.080]   We get the text message too and it's terrible
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.600]   But I think it's chicken in the egg apple won't adopt it until sufficient people have adopted it
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.800]   But we've learned over time that's fish people don't adopt it until apple adopts it
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.440]   So one of them has to just blink for our benefit or our
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:26.600]   You know our sake here's a little nudge from haroshi lokheimer who is in charge of uh android
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:33.720]   Uh for google going forward says lokheimer the default messaging experience on android is going to be more secure
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:39.960]   The fallback messaging experience on the author platform will not have encryption if it's still sms
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.960]   I think that's a pretty interesting dynamic
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.040]   I would hope that as everyone focuses on security and privacy it becomes an important part
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:52.200]   Of the discussion lokheimer according to the verge would not confirm if google is inactive discussions
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:57.400]   We forget the name of ios because like tim always says android the other platform
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.560]   Yeah
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.680]   Well, it's
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.480]   It's a point
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.520]   There is a good point to be made that if i message is going to be
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:10.440]   Essentially the only the only widespread messaging platform that's available for for the iphone
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.880]   I'm not i'm not discounting wechat and and signal and the others
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.760]   But i'm saying what most people when they want to fall
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.000]   But they when they when they when they pick up the phone trying to send a text message
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.240]   With with with cute pictures to their brothers and sisters about how their vacation is going
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.520]   That is really the only choice that p that iphone users have available
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:34.360]   You i think apple needs to make a case of why they wouldn't try to make that as inclusive as as possible
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.840]   particularly when there's another standard that
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:43.080]   Getting t-mobile on board was very very big there was a there was a lot of waffling about this the standard
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:48.040]   But if it if it delivers value to users and if it helps i'm messaging app
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:54.920]   Achieve its goal of helping people to stay connected together and there is a there is a security benefit to it
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:01.480]   I wish that apple would again not not be defensive and and be fulfilled so they've they've got to make a statement about this
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:06.680]   But I wish that they would explain why they don't think that this is a good fit for for the i-mestaging platform
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.200]   They'll just i'm sure they'll just say it's not widely adopted enough yet and then
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:15.560]   Because you're not adopting it. You made a great monthly active rc s users around the globe
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:22.120]   It's only recently been coming to america and that's only because as you said the dinosaurs and the carriers have been slow to adopt
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:25.400]   But now that verizon has joined a tntt mobile
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.040]   Maybe maybe
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:34.120]   If if nothing else it would really blunt people like me who complain that gee why why you're making i message multi platform
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.640]   Why are you putting us in different differently covered bubbles?
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.560]   Jail
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.560]   And again, it would be a nice thing to do
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.560]   I'm curious as to as to the hey
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.720]   And I don't know the behavior of the average person of how they how they deal with it
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.360]   I I was just trying to think about while we were talking about it like how many green messages do I get versus blue messages?
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.400]   And I realized that I I didn't realize it's what we were talking about it that I my behavior is is that if you have a green message
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.400]   I use email
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:06.280]   I just realized no, no, I just I just stopped texting because i'm like, oh green, you know like it means I can't send anything
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:09.720]   I can't do this I can't do that I can't and so I just I just switch over to
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:17.240]   But I didn't realize I was doing it wasn't conscious. I just realized that I that I that I just it's just harder when someone is is
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.360]   And then when someone goes blue you're always like you're blue, you know like you get these line these makes
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.200]   If you cut us do we not bleed
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.240]   But
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:37.000]   I use all of the all of my messages like like all the little weird emojis and and gifts and all like just constantly
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.480]   We're always going back and forth and if someone has green that just get texts
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.720]   You know like like it's just like
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.160]   Something really interesting, but you can't see it
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:51.000]   All I just to do is make iMessage plus and charge two dollars a month for a gold bubble and then everybody will want
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.960]   I'm a gold bubble. I'm a gold bubble. I'm a gold bubble
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.840]   Tim the money's waiting for you
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:04.280]   Get me get Beyonce give a free account to Beyonce and other influencers and then oh yeah carlogger
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.480]   That's how you increase that piece of pie about services everyone who got the gold watch gets the gold bubble
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.440]   Watch out for the gold
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.680]   Airpods
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.680]   the counterfeit air pod
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.000]   Business has reached now
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.080]   significant number
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.520]   62.2 million dollars
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:29.960]   Confiscated in the first nine months of the us governments fiscal year 360,000
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:37.400]   counterfeit wireless headphones seized by customs because they look like air pods
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:43.560]   Custom says there's probably only a fraction of all the fake headphones sold worldwide
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.240]   I'm a little bit worried about that because
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:53.720]   Counterfeits are a huge problem and it's a huge problem for individuals because it's one thing if you say gee
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.720]   I really like I really want people to think that I've got the 200 dollar air pods
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.040]   But I don't want to I won't don't want to spend more than 29 dollars
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.640]   I much rather buy these knockoffs
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:06.600]   The big problem is that when they buy from eBay they buy from Amazon through like a third-party seller
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:12.040]   And they think that they're getting air pods, but they're all they're getting these cheap crap 29 dollar plastic things
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:19.320]   But I I'm a little bit worried when customs takes on the responsibility of saying no
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:28.360]   You're this this version of the thing you stick in your ear for Bluetooth audio looks too much like Apple's thing you stick
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.920]   Yeah, remember with the one plus air. Yeah, the one plus headphones, which were legit
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:38.360]   They thought well, they look too much like air pods, so we're gonna block them. We're gonna seize those
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.880]   If you're trying to you'll be you'll be in jail
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:49.240]   Yeah, I was saying if you're trying to fit human ears most human ears are very very similar to each other
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.760]   So we say no you you will only make you can only definitely be sure to be able to
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.440]   Import your earphones if you make them like I don't know like square
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.200]   Have like lots of sharp edges that go into your ear
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:05.160]   Yeah, I mean it does look like the apple it is of course the job of customs to block count of course
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:10.360]   So they're doing the best they can I mean the apple apple air pods do have a very specific look to them
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:14.840]   So so it's you know they compared to every other air product. I mean every other bluetooth
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.520]   Well, you've seen the fake uh iphones. I even have one in my office. Yeah, they're from Shenzhen
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:26.040]   They're they're really like an other one right up like right where you boot it up and it's running and right but i'm just in that it's
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.040]   Right. Oh no, I've got yeah
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:33.560]   And I've seen somewhere you really have to drill deep down before you before you you break your nose
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.280]   On the on that glass that glass shut door
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.880]   You only find out when you turn out to be a blue bubble then then then you
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.160]   Yeah, exactly
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.600]   You know and I and I think that when they say that apple's losing 3.2 billion
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.560]   I I doubt it
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.240]   The question is is whether how many of those people would actually buy the full-priced one
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.760]   Right, you know compared to the 29 dollar version of it. So yeah, I did probably much more than number because I think it's you know
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.320]   That's like when they they make a drug bust. They say that's a billion dollars worth of heroin
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.840]   Street, I've been
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:08.520]   I've been scoffing at that since I was like 11 years old and defending myself for like ripping off electronic arts games
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.280]   Okay, first of all, it's not like it's not like i'm a little kid
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.000]   I would be able to I would have been able to afford a 49 dollar game
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.560]   If I had $50 and I spent it on a game my mom would tan my high to believe you
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:25.880]   That's how we all that's how we um like for anyone in graphics the the first the first thing you stole was photoshop
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:31.800]   Yeah, so sure like it's yeah, I would never bought it otherwise. Well, I got it with a scanner
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.200]   You know like I got my first one
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.640]   I got I got I got the first one with uh, you know from a friend
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.280]   Um, but but soon after that that you know they bundled it with all the scanners and so in the early 90s
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.800]   You can get photoshop with any any anytime you bought a scanner you got a you got I have to think they must look a little
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.600]   away because they know that the
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:57.400]   You know they're getting you hooked Alex and you know you've bought how many copies of photoshop since you spent a lot of money on
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.680]   Oh, yeah, I know absolutely. I mean they I'm wall they they moved to subscription model
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.160]   That's part of the way you get rid of some of that because just you know, it's not a bit
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.600]   You know, it's it's much harder to break the subscription model than it is for
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:13.000]   Because it's always checking in checking at home. So they they've definitely managed that and you know for from from a software
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.080]   Perspective and we're going a little into a rat hole, but from a software perspective the company's that had the highest
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:25.240]   Um piracy rates also had the highest sales. So, um because as soon as you started
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.440]   You know, you you took the software and you started making money with it
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.200]   And then you were afraid you're gonna get you know as soon as you have employees you can't do that anymore because one
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.640]   You know frustrated employee calls this software
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.560]   You know, whatever you know, whatever bureau or whatever and you're you have a quarter million dollar fine
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.640]   So so you're super careful about it once you have a company once you're making money
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.040]   And so a lot of companies learned to just kind of look the other way
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.320]   There's tons and tons of books on Maya and there wasn't one that many users
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.000]   I mean literally there was some point where we realized there were the sales of Maya
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.640]   training was
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.720]   More than the sales of the software
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.200]   You know, and that's when you know that there's a big piracy
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:06.520]   You know thing going on out there is because people are buying buying a lot of books for something that they don't own
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.840]   um, and so
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:14.360]   So they moved to the subscription models. Um, but but I think that the ones that the companies that were really good at electric images
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:17.720]   Which is what I use was really good at securing their software
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:22.280]   Um, and they also were really the last is long. Nobody bought them. Yeah, because no
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:26.760]   You didn't have the money to spend $7,500 on a piece of software when you were 20
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:33.640]   22 years old so you I was an intern somewhere just to get access to it. There's another concern by the way with
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.280]   uh counterfeit
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:44.440]   Battery powered devices, you know, yeah is the safety concern mica sarti in the our discord says you don't want any of your devices catching fire
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.000]   After you accidentally swallow them while listening during sleep and I think he's very
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.720]   Carey good point there
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.000]   Those catapot air pods really don't sit well
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.040]   on the stomach
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.280]   Is that little stem i can feel it
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:03.400]   The elephant has to pass that and a hat
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.560]   I
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.880]   God if i'd gone for the samson does this
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:10.520]   Much much simpler process
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.720]   Speaking of adobe premier pro joins the adobe m1 compatible
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:20.680]   Family today new 2021 july 2021 release 15.4
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.800]   Native support for m1 devices. What is what is not native at this point?
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.400]   um
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.400]   after user ems
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.600]   Yeah
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:35.320]   Well, and also from from I just want to point out that this upgrade is massive like for premier
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:40.680]   I mean it's it is not just that it's m1 support they're doing speech to text. I mean for accessibility
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:47.080]   They're doing speech to text transprediting tools, uh general, you know generate captions automatically
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.400]   Uh title and encapsulating styling. I mean there is an in there is a they
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.200]   This is a huge upgrade for for the app. It's amazing
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:01.400]   Nice. Are we gonna are do we upgrade or do we if we're still using windows 7?
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.920]   So for some reason I have a feeling we will not be using premier pro 15.4
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:12.060]   Anytime soon it'd be nice to have the auto windows director is one hell of an
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.440]   A lot of people does it but yeah, yeah, the one thing the one thing I say the the reason that all these captioning tools
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:22.840]   You know the accessibility is a is a noble cause but the reason that all these captioning tools are going in
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:29.320]   Is because of facebook because people make decisions about whether they're gonna play in a movie by they want to see the captions
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.720]   So they look down and they go
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.520]   It's mobile in general
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:39.880]   Mobile in general that people want but but facebook is that was what you know a lot of this the software coming out today
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.280]   Was generated three or four years ago, right?
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:45.480]   And you know it was I mean it was planned three or four or five years ago
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.840]   I agree
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:52.120]   But when facebook pushed through what we saw was a huge demand for live captions a huge demand to caption everything
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:59.000]   Because people are making decisions in the feed about whether they're gonna play it based on what they're watching and and that became a huge
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.400]   Issue to to move this forward. I'm you know, I'm tick-tock for me. I
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.680]   Really turn on the sound because I don't want anybody to know I'm watching it
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.600]   And they just added captioning to the stuff right there editor too
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:17.000]   But smart ticktockers have always been put in text onto their ticktocks because that's people don't have the sound on very often
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.040]   And if I don't know what's going on, I'm not gonna keep watching
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.760]   I'm just go flip up
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.440]   Uh
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:28.520]   We could do some rumors. I think at this point any rumors you're hearing are
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.680]   You know
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:36.440]   Rumors just that new mac books between now and next year. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah, I just
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:40.920]   Have some sort of screen as well. Yeah, the the mini led screens
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:47.160]   According to some were difficult to make in short supply and that's why the mac books were delayed
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.240]   That kind of makes sense. Maybe they'll be out this year. Maybe not
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:57.880]   A redesigned ipad mini with the a 15 processor and a usb c port that seems like a good idea
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:04.280]   Especially smaller bezels so you get a much bigger screen in that same size case
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.520]   And my guess is ipad air with touch style touch idea not face ID
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.480]   So they can make it basically a small ipad air and not charge a lot for it
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:17.160]   Oh still premium still not like bargain basement, but not pro. Yeah, that's interesting
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:22.600]   I gotta say even as even as a guy who dropped $1500 on a new ipad pro
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.400]   The idea of a seriously upgraded ipad mini
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:31.320]   That really gets my attention because there's there's it's still I love my ipad pro
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:36.200]   I'm very glad I bought it. It serves the role that I that I desired for it very very well
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.720]   But the one thing that I can't do is that it still can't
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.880]   When I put it in my my shoulder bag, it's definitely
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.000]   It's definitely a
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.640]   Tablet inside my yeah, it's the same way does it
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:56.920]   Yeah, back book. Yeah, this is the the the ipad mini would perfectly suit the role of I don't even have any plans
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.920]   whatsoever to do any work everything productive whatsoever
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:05.000]   But nonetheless if I find out that my train's been delayed two hours
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.960]   And all of a sudden I want to watch a longer movie or actually do want to like do some writing
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.200]   I've got this thing in my bag again
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:17.480]   The one of the interest one of the most devilish use cases I have are the the classic
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.160]   I've got a meeting in New York City at like 11 in the morning
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.400]   I intend to stay visit
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:28.120]   Stay afterward visit friends maybe take it an opera and then take the the late train back
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:32.280]   It's not something where I want to have lots of things carrying with me because I'm going to have to carry that with me
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.640]   To museums through central park through through the Met
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:40.760]   But still I've got stuff that I got to do so the idea of having a bare minimum
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:45.160]   But do that bare minimum stuff really really well system is a really big thing
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.160]   And I I believe I could find
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.960]   Like 600 or 700 dollars to spend on something like that. Yeah, I'm great
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.280]   I have to say I decided not to bring my laptop to Hawaii on vacation. I only brought yay
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:02.760]   My iPhone and my uh, ipad and it worked great. In fact
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:09.480]   Uh, I think the ipad is the definitely the way i'll be doing my photo processing from now and I was able to you know
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.320]   What were you processing on?
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.320]   So I have a sony a7
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.160]   the the
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.760]   current a7
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.280]   R mark 4
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:21.960]   And connected it with a usb c cable because it has usb c in
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.200]   To the ipad used, um photos to import it
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.640]   Photos actually can handle the raw and does a pretty good job
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.240]   And then if I want to edit it
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:37.400]   I've got you know dark room and affinity photo and pixel mator pro and pixel mator photo and yeah all the usual
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:42.040]   But i've actually found that you know importing into photos is great because now it's backed up
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.640]   It's in photos. They're the raws. It's on my phone too
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:52.200]   It's great for sharing and and there are a number of times when the the camera didn't do a good job of white balance
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.720]   I was able to fix that white balance very quickly in photos
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:01.000]   Uh do the cropping and photos straightening that kind of thing maybe pop it a little bit
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.720]   That's all I really needed on all of them. So I haven't done much post processing the one thing
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.440]   You know, there was one picture of
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.080]   Lisa and michael on the beach
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:16.840]   The beach is bright their faces are dark. I really wanted to do, you know selective region
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:21.720]   Retouching and I couldn't really do that. Maybe I can take light rooms on on the ipad too
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.680]   It is so I yeah, I was about to say I have
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:31.800]   I have been in the past year honestly my favorite phone game has been light room mobile really because
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:38.360]   I mean, I'll see just I have it on there. I just didn't even think to launch it. Yeah. Well, it's I mean the the photos that
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.640]   That the camera app gives you are really really good
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:46.360]   But when you have the the the different right now all phone cameras take a pretty good picture
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:54.440]   Oftentimes I think that it's the the difference between one camera and another phone camera is isn't as great as the difference between simply
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:24:00.520]   What uh the engineers and kupertino think is a good picture and what personally you
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:06.920]   Affects you and so the ability to simply say okay. I'm going to not only have fine grain control over
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:11.080]   not just two slides for color balance, but also what kind of uh
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.480]   Uh, what kind of color toning do I want? What kind of a color profile?
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:20.840]   Do I do I want in this but also simply say this would be so it's the background is distracting
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:25.320]   I know I will simply put a draw circle around like the central figure
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:30.280]   Invert that and then tell please tell tell the app please darken everything around the circle
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:35.240]   Do that do that kind of uh, can you do that like radiant filters? Oh, yeah, no, I'm gonna do gradient filters
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.320]   You can do in all kinds of directions
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:43.880]   And I I've almost had to stop sort of saying in my instagram feed that all this I took this with my my pixel one
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:47.800]   Oh my god. I had no idea the pixel one took such amazing pictures like okay
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.600]   Look pixel one plus like 10 or 15 minutes of fiddling around with it in light room mobile
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.240]   Because again, it's not a subtle difference between
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:03.080]   The the logical problem of how do we create a picture that that almost almost everybody will like to how do we create a picture that?
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.400]   And you not go specifically uh loves what did and it's i'm ashamed to admit
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.320]   I didn't even think of that. I thought well, I'll just wait till I get home and i'll do it on the on the mac
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:15.640]   But but you're right. I could have that's the beauty of this the i the main point
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:20.760]   I guess is that the workflow from the camera to the ipad now is pretty seamless in fact
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.120]   I think you can import directly in the light room mobile now. I think they've fixed that as well
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:30.600]   Yeah, so that's very seamless and there are a huge number of really good photo retouching tools on the ipad
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:37.400]   Plus with that good screen. I think that's a really and you know touch and the screen is just it's very natural way to work with photos
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.560]   Exactly. I trust the i trust the ipad screen more than i trust
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.480]   The screen that i'm looking at right now or pretty much any other device screen
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:50.360]   And and the ability it's this is a i said this probably when the with the first ipad too
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.800]   But it doubled this
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.360]   Uh in the new ipad pro with it with a new screen
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:59.720]   The ability to simply slurp in like photo images for directly from your camera and do your triage
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:05.640]   And you're not looking at thumbnails. You're looking at eight by beautiful eight by ten color prints of each frame
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:12.040]   It's like there are there are times when things happen to the the the the image is just really really good and I stop like wow
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.120]   Wow, I'm really glad I downloaded this wallpaper. It's really oh wait. No, this is just a picture
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.000]   On this is just this it really does look like a beautiful luminous print
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.200]   If anything it makes me upset because I know that if I do like this picture even after editing and get it printed
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:29.960]   It's not going to look as good as it did on my ipad pro screen if I
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.880]   I can't take advantage with stills of hdr or can I
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.080]   Of the hdr capability of the screen. I'm not going to see
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:42.040]   Specced. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, it'll it'll it'll show the full brightness. Oh nice
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:47.560]   So even though it's a little bit of a darker. It's a only a five or six hundred knit screen
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.680]   No, no, the pro the pro is the pro is the opt-out
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:57.960]   It'll go up to 1600 in specular highlights in hdr. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So we so if I have that in my photos
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:04.280]   Even if they're not hdr photos. I'll see it. Yeah, okay. Nice. And honestly, that's a
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.040]   I was very specific when I said that it's my my favorite mobile game on my phone
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:13.880]   Because the number times where I get I'm just waiting for waiting for a train or something and I just scroll through pictures
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.960]   Forget that. Oh, wow. I took that little snapshot
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.080]   That was kind of good and just playing with it for 15 or 20 minutes
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.160]   Even if it's not like
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:25.480]   Doing rational things like no, I decided that I want the background to be red and purple
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.320]   I want the foreground to be blue and orange and then I want to have like a
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.680]   I want to have a blur effect on this side. It's just such a fun thing to just be able to play
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:42.200]   And not not by sitting down to a big like editing console with all my little all kinds of knobs and and and switches of things
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:47.720]   Just I'm just bored and I'm just trying to it cost me nothing to push that slider all the way to the right and see what happens
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.720]   And then realize that oh actually that does look
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:54.920]   It's extreme. It's not natural in the very least but that is kind of cool. Great. Let's push all the way to the right
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.120]   Anyway, it's fun for indian after his definition. Yeah
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.720]   Right, but I'm just glad to say I did not feel any deficiency. I was able to get email
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:09.000]   I was able to check, you know, do all the things that I wanted to do. I didn't need I didn't miss
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.600]   More importantly, I did not miss my macbook. So that worked well that worked out well
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.720]   Very pleased to say
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.040]   Actually, I was just logging in to see
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.760]   I bet it is too if it's all on my iCloud, right
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.400]   All the photos because I use iCloud photo
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.960]   Yep, I could show you some pictures of Hawaii
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:35.080]   Let me see. Are they no where's my oh there they are. Yeah
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:41.320]   This is I'm on a Linux box. So you understand that my my questions
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:45.160]   I'll show you the
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.400]   Photo I took on the beach with it with Lisa and Michael and how
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:57.640]   So so this is this is after retouching in iPhoto. I mean you you really get I think of it does a very good job
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.440]   Yeah, the white balance was a little blue
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:03.720]   As you can see so yeah
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.400]   Nobody's on that beach. I know I edited them all out
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:13.160]   There were actually 43,000 people on that beach and three quarters of them with covet 19. No
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:17.080]   This is uh, this is a very nice beach off the beaten path
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.280]   You don't have to have a lot of people on white key actually
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:26.200]   Lightroom mobile does have that tool. So if you want to yeah, you're the regional uh brightening thing
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:30.040]   Let me see not just regional brightening, but if you want to remove people from from background. Oh, yeah, I know
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.560]   So here's an example. This is unre touched. So it's a little dark
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.920]   So I would want to like brighten them up a little bit right. Yeah
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:42.280]   Um still yeah, nobody's on that beach and i'm not telling you where that beach is
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:45.480]   ever
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:50.200]   But there is an Airbnb on that beach with my name on it someday
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:55.480]   Uh, one of those stories will be will be be talking about this week. Let's see
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.440]   iPhone 13
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:05.800]   Will feature Wi-Fi 6e okay, maybe yeah actually this is more than a rumor. I versionly. Oh, yeah
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:10.920]   Yeah, you know these rumors. Who cares. I don't know. Well, actually believe it or not here. We are
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:18.200]   Almost all the way through july the iphone 13 is only a couple months away. Right. Wow. Why is he?
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.920]   I'm just quick just very quickly
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:24.520]   Now is the time where I start to pay more attention to rumors than I might have before
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.240]   Because now they have to start to they have to start trusting like the frado corleones of the supply chain
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:33.320]   That okay. I know I know you're you're stupid. I know that you're gonna lose lips
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:39.160]   But at some point you're gonna have to draw us a pick you're gonna have to design that this ad so fine
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:44.440]   Here's a picture. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead rina. You were gonna say something. Oh, I was gonna say um
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:48.600]   A lot of people really excited about Wi-Fi 6 but a lot of the early deployments of it
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.560]   You know on the router side, especially weren't that great
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:56.440]   And the Wi-Fi 6e goes to the six gigahertz spectrum, which is much more open
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:01.400]   It's not faster than five gigahertz but five gigahertz has so much congestion that you often don't get really good speeds
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:06.440]   So you'll be able to get more potential from these speeds. So it's an upgrade that i've been looking forward to for a long time. Yeah
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:09.080]   I have uh my um
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:11.960]   I had Wi-Fi 6
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:16.360]   With my um neck gear or be and then I put in the um
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:20.840]   Ubiquities and I think it's not I don't think i have Wi-Fi 6 with those I'd have to upgrade that
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.280]   But I figure I've been telling everybody don't even bother wait for 6e
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:29.720]   Because that's just around the corner. Yeah, so oh maybe now is the time to look at a 6e router
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.080]   Yeah
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:34.280]   I saw an interesting question that someone posted that
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:40.920]   Sounds ridiculous on the face of it, but it's it's an interesting topic for for for discussion on a slow news week
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:49.800]   Do you think that apple has any fear of using the number 13 in a product name or is this going to be the the iphone x mark?
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:53.000]   I tell you there was no 13th floor in the uh hotel. I was in
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.440]   There was no iphone 9 but there was an 813 chips that
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.640]   Yeah
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:02.920]   True, but 13 so is it where is it just in the west the 13 is considered unlucky?
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:07.800]   Because I know in Asia in Asia. Yeah, what is it? What is it? What is it?
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.400]   In Asia for four because it's the same sound as as death sit sit
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.240]   so
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.360]   Huh?
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.080]   So there was an i4 and four you think they'll you think that they will defer to western sensibilities and
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.480]   Skip the iphone 13
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:27.320]   I don't think there's a lot of sales back here from now. Yeah, well maybe not. Yeah, well it wasn't on china mobile yet
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.400]   Yeah
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.240]   Oh, you're right. You know what?
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:35.720]   It wasn't it wasn't it wasn't available in china yet. So they didn't have to worry about that
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:39.400]   And the gray market people didn't care. They just wanted a knife. Yeah, exactly
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:43.880]   No, nox Harrington is pointing out. They did release ios 13 so
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:49.000]   Hey, anything to say about 14.7 besides that it now supports that
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.120]   Magsafe battery adapter is there are there security patches or anything else going on with that?
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:58.200]   I'm sure there are I just I'm so enamored with 15 now that I haven't done my diligence
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:02.200]   I know you know what I know I had my iPad with 15 on it
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:11.320]   I'm so close. I know what you mean. Yeah, I haven't done it yet, but it's like everyone's like oh as soon as the new Mac Mac OS beta
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:19.320]   Supports this feature. I'm probably gonna have to do it. Uh, they are gonna. Uh, this is the apple card family sharing will be implemented
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:27.080]   Uh for merging two. Oh no, they already got it in 14.6 the family card. It's now you can merge two apple cards
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:29.960]   into one
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:32.200]   So
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.000]   Uh, I don't I don't understand really the point but okay
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.680]   Home pod timer management
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:44.120]   Air quality information will appear on weather's weather and maps app
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:48.680]   Uh from Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, South Korea and Spain
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:55.640]   Podcast library if you use the podcast app now has an option. Let's use your see all shows or only followed shows
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:01.800]   And there are some bug fixes with the mood with new podcast support that apples put in
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.320]   Can you just drag and drop your podcast up there? Is it still an RSS feed?
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:10.440]   Is still you put an RSS feed in or do you can you just just drag your
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.640]   Two separate things now the public podcasts are still RSS
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:18.200]   But the private podcasts the paid podcast are hosted by apples you have to upload them separately to apple
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.360]   So they are not RSS when you can't subscribe to them in a third party client
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:28.200]   But if you do that you just you can just drag them in you don't have to do the RSS or servers or anything else
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.200]   You just put them on the apple server
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:35.240]   Yeah, and then they add it to their own RSS like the it's a secure RSS link that people you and you can only use it
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.240]   I believe an apple podcast at the moment
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:42.360]   Interesting between this and Spotify were getting completely locked down. Yeah, you know, they just bought
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.520]   It was an afterrogan and call her daddy now
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:51.640]   Um, I forget the woman's name, but they're paying 60 million dollars for her show what yeah. Yeah. Wow
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:54.040]   Is that a big show?
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:56.040]   Never heard of it call her daddy
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.960]   It was it was notorious because yeah
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:02.600]   It was it was two women who were doing sort of a sex advice show and then they had a few that became very popular
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:07.080]   And they were airing their grievances and I got a ton of attention. I like one of them left and started her own show
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.560]   And so fia franklin, which oh, it's a farce to Franklin is they bought bar stool
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:14.440]   They they bought the whole bar stool. No, just call it
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.800]   I think they just took the show
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.120]   Yeah, because part of their their disagreement with bar stool was them owning the show at a certain point
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:25.320]   And being able to to get other deals. It's alexa Alex Cooper. She calls herself
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.720]   calling daddy
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:29.880]   Uh, wow 60 million dollars
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:33.080]   I guess I picked the wrong subject to podcast about
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:38.200]   My understanding I've done some small research into this
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.200]   Tea
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:46.120]   Is important in the in the economic factors you need to have must feel it you must spill it. Yes spill the tea
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:49.960]   I don't know how yeah, exactly. Yeah, I was gonna beef tea and beef
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:53.720]   I'm sorry. That's what i'm looking for. Uh, you need to have tea. You also have need to have the beef
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:55.880]   I don't know whether it's like
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:02.920]   hamburger or big beef cut big beef beef beef beefs with people like so it's like dining out content
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.240]   gosh
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:08.680]   I should have really it spun that
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:14.760]   Laporte d'vorex stuff up into a a bigger beef in other words, what you know what what you need is you need a makeup pal
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.440]   I think john wanted to but uh, but I just wasn't I didn't get it
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.080]   What's I wasn't going along?
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:24.760]   I think I think that at minimum rene and alex need a makeup palette
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.920]   Yeah, it also doubles as one of those like color charts
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:30.120]   Yeah, it's when you flip it open there's a mirror so you can like make to your makeup
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:37.560]   But the makeup is itself like a color calibration perfect. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so I um, oh, he's already got it
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.560]   I'm afraid there it is
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.680]   apple is going to lease a hollywood hub for filming
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:49.720]   Shows and movies. I'm sure you know all about this alex from the wall street journal
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:53.240]   Um, it's looking at several possible locations
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:58.520]   They the new hub could exceed half a million square feet. Is that big? Is that like not really?
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:04.760]   That's that's it's bigger than a sound state smaller than a backlot or it's it's a couple sounds stages
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.160]   Like that's that that let you do a bunch of I mean, it's it's still still a lot of space but
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.600]   um
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.440]   But you have to remember that like a you know a a hundred by hundred space
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:19.640]   You know, it's still that's 10 000 by itself and then you yeah, so so you don't need that many
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:22.520]   A lot of those spaces can add up pretty quickly. Um, it is a
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.520]   You know so far hollywood's done. Okay. It's selling
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:33.160]   Um this stuff to apple and netflix and amazon and so on and so forth but amazon and netflix has already built
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:37.480]   massive facilities to do this for themselves and a lot of that is on right
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:43.240]   Yeah, so they're and so apple's just going down the same path that all these other streamers are and that doesn't bode well
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.800]   They're obviously doing in la because that's where the talent is
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:51.960]   But this doesn't bode well for and then you can see that's why people want to sell to amazon or they want to you know
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:58.280]   Like sell the whole company to them because they're trying to maximize the value of the of the studio before it's not valuable anymore
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.800]   The studios, you know, they're in classic example of that
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.440]   Yeah, I mean they have a huge library that's valuable to
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.040]   That's to somebody but it won't be valid
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.880]   But they won't for much longer be able to stay competitive and so so I think that there's going to be more probably see more consolidation
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:14.280]   Because of that of that process because it's just not
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.120]   uh
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:21.480]   Yeah, it doesn't doesn't make as much sense. Amazon has uh the culver studios or the majority of it
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:25.240]   14 acres we're gone with the wind and citizen caner filmed
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:31.560]   Netflix occupy several sound stages, but also built purchase to develop its own albercurky
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.200]   home of breaking their massive
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.800]   Well and that and that went to albercurky of course because of the tax incentives and then you know
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.680]   um
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.640]   And so but they have other ones that are spread around and and you know
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:47.480]   They it's just the sheer scale of these streaming companies is way bigger than any of these individual studios ever were
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:52.200]   And when I think one will know that it's over is when paramount sells their their backlog
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:55.560]   Yeah, which will happen probably in the next five years really you think so
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.640]   even with all the the big bucks of Comcast the
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:03.480]   They don't need it. I don't know if that yeah, I don't know if at all
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.800]   Maybe maybe they can maybe that that makes sense
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.080]   But I think that that's that's gonna be when they sell that off then you'll win that
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.720]   currently apple leases
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.480]   sounds
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:17.240]   Stages from various places right or or they or they outsource it
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:20.680]   You know, I mean like it doesn't you know, it doesn't have to be they have they don't have to lease them all
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.320]   They can all just hire a production company the production company figures out where it's shooting whether you know, especially stuff
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:31.320]   That's on on location. You'd only use the backlot for some things, you know, so so those are the things that will you know
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:33.880]   the real question
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.840]   I think a lot of us wonder I mean the big problem with apple tv plus is its lack of catalog
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.800]   I mean, that's that's clearly what Netflix has going for it Amazon. I prime has going for it
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:48.120]   Disney was to be fair that you know Netflix started very slowly
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.400]   I mean they only had probably four or five properties when they began, you know
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.760]   And so part of it is you don't want to throw, you know, bad money
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:40:00.680]   You don't want to spend a lot of while you're figuring it out. So apple's learning like everybody else did amazon started with a handful of product
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:03.160]   Um Netflix started with a handful of products
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.360]   They they didn't just suddenly turn the pipe on and suddenly make you know, um, huge amounts of Amazon
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:12.840]   Amazon and Netflix are years ahead of everybody else and so they're producing all that content
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:18.680]   But it is something that there's a learning curve. They're figuring out what they're you know, what makes sense what hits Ted lasso hit
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:22.360]   So that was you know, that's good the morning show hit the the
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:28.120]   So there's there's things that they've they've had and they'll take that learning back and because what they're getting is data
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:32.600]   You know, you have to remember that they're putting stuff out as a streaming company. They're not it's not just you know
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:35.640]   It's not sales the way we'd see it before they're watching their
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:43.400]   Amazon or Netflix especially they're watching the data who watched it how many watched it how long did they watch it how you know
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:50.760]   Where did they quit watching it? You know, did there you know, like all this information comes back and then they you start to crunch that and figure out what what you start buying next
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:56.760]   You know, and so so they're right now. They're just in that experimentation phase and but that all everybody went through that
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:01.960]   So you don't think they'll acquire catalog. I mean amazon prime is basically buying mgm for
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:09.080]   I wouldn't be surprised shows. It's efficient. Yeah, it's efficient to buy a catalog. Absolutely. So I could see them, you know, purchasing
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.560]   I still think that apples should just purchase disney
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:16.760]   Yeah, it's getting with me makes a lot of sense. It's too hard. It's too hard now. It would have been
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:22.280]   It just gets harder every every year. Yeah, if they had listened to you years ago in butt Disney, they'd be
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:25.160]   It's all in saying doesn't they'd be some say yep
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:30.360]   Doesn't loreen shares keep growing with Disney so there's something they could work out. Yeah. Yeah, exactly
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:35.640]   I mean apples apples shares will keep going up too and so you know, they're they're a little ahead of Disney's as far as scale goes
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:42.520]   But but there's so many parts of disney that makes sense for apple that that that's the the thing that is the most interesting is is there's the content
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.760]   There's additional
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.680]   Interactive content that could be created there are
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.880]   You know location experiences that could be added what they are
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:53.560]   There's so many play. It's not just that you buy disney for the content
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:58.440]   You buy disney for everything that disney has fits into apple media. I need to present my childhood
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:05.800]   Yeah, I mean, but I mean if you go all the way down to you know, if you wanted to you know, push into the education market having disney's ip would be
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:08.440]   super useful
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.280]   But is that would that be compatible with apples company culture? They're not
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:18.280]   They're not a company. They're a company that's used to saying we have a small group of people at the very very top of this company
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:23.240]   Who run apps who know everything that goes on and run absolutely everything inside a company
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:31.080]   Is when a company like disney that has so many individual interests in and of itself would they would apple be able to
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:38.680]   Run it as a as run it as a department with an apple or would it simply be okay? You are you we technically
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.560]   We're you're gonna redo the the old
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.800]   Basically, we're just basically everything stays the same everything stays the same
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:50.120]   We just own you and we have our exactly two years have a lot more talks if you you know
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:56.360]   I think that the two two things there one is is that this is probably the most likely to make that work than any any other
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:01.080]   Company that apple would possibly purchase because of the way that they're they're pretty
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:09.720]   You know, not all of their properties, but disney central is pretty controlling so the um so I think that they're probably more likely to make sense
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:14.360]   In addition to that, you know when apple bought beats. They didn't stop them from being beats
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.840]   They simply extracted what they needed out of
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:22.600]   Beats and let them continue to be beats in fact injected apple technology into what beats is doing
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:26.040]   So I I don't think that that necessarily you have to change the way
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:31.720]   Disney works it from a pure scale perspective. It's just not the way apple generally works
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.480]   You're absolutely right that they would not work that way
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:36.760]   But I think that at some point if they fall for far enough behind
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:42.200]   Which I think that they have the high potential that they'll fall behind because I don't think that most of the content they're creating is very compelling
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:47.240]   Like I I think that it's most of its dull, you know, and it's just not it's not that interesting in
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.000]   And so so I think that they it's problematic. I think it takes too
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.280]   They
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.800]   They don't have too many missions that Netflix and amazon had
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.800]   Right. No, you're absolutely right that's that's the problem and again, there's so much of it
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:05.320]   That's kind of got some social tinge to it. It's not just you just can't sit down and just watch it and just relax
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:08.600]   You know, there's there's something there's and I get it
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.000]   I mean they they want to be the next whatever the thing
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.600]   But the problem is is that all of it's that way or it feels that way and you just kind of go
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.000]   Okay, sometimes I just want to sit down and watch someone beat somebody else
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.480]   I want to watch Jason Bourne, you know, like I just want to watch Jason Bourne or I want to watch Avengers
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:24.360]   Or I want to watch and I don't need it to have some bigger meaning
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.440]   I just you know, I just want to just be real relax it or I want to watch or whatever
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:33.560]   I want to watch half naked men play volleyball while women and bikinis look on at my ringleats sometimes
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.520]   I don't know about trash is exactly what we want. Where is that? No, I'm saying
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:42.200]   He's curious. I
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:48.440]   My wife and I had this discussion she goes life too short to you know to keep on watching the same movie over and over again
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.760]   You know because she's complaining about the fact that I can watch movies. You know, I can't I can't I try
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:58.120]   I want to I want to watch Terminator 2 again. I really do but it's like I saw this
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:01.080]   But my my thing is it's like I already know that's a good movie
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.920]   Yeah
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.840]   And there's a other movie ago. Well, that was a waste of two hours
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.360]   This will never be a way to
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:11.640]   Will never be the waste of two hours. Yeah, Princess bride is always a always a great experience from yeah
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:14.040]   And without and without getting into a look an hour long sidetrack
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.440]   I find that like if I really love a movie
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:21.080]   It's only on the third or fourth viewing that like I've the enough of the map
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:25.960]   I've I've I've formed enough of an immunity to the magic of this movie and what it does
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:31.480]   To my sense of disbelief to actually start noticing details that are really really wonderful
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.920]   I'm not just talking about it. Hey. Oh, wow. Did you notice that in the book?
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:40.440]   In the back shelf, you see a book. It's it's purple. That's actually a reference in Avengers number 12
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.320]   I'm talking about I had I had no oh
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:44.520]   the
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:53.000]   I didn't notice the bud brigman as has a stain on his shirt because he basically they the production designer realized that oh
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.760]   We're gonna have to refer back to something that happened off camera
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:00.360]   Like I know I know this doesn't happen in this in the actual script pages
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.240]   But we know that he had this big big fight with someone off camera
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:08.200]   So we're gonna put a tear in this whole this hole right here to to say that oh time has happened
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:11.880]   The things have happened. I have to live a little things that kind of Andy the chamom has found you
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.520]   The channel that you were looking for yes
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:21.240]   So there you go again. Yeah, that's that's
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:25.560]   Anyways, so I said you got to say objectively those are some good looking men
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:31.640]   If you're gonna hire if you're gonna hire some men to be sweaty and topless and play volleyball
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:37.400]   They they chose very for those of you listening. We're watching the top gun volleyball scene
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:41.480]   And that's you know, I don't mind watching a movie again in a context like that
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:46.040]   But I wouldn't want to watch you I just find you can't you can't remember all the funny lines until you've watched it 30
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:51.320]   That's that's the whole thing. You know like you just it just takes a certain and you have a decipher that they really are
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.800]   Fucking a part and complain about until you see five times
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:58.200]   I mean, but you you thought you thought you could trick me to thinking that I like this movie
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.200]   But on the 18th viewings
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.640]   You can find your you can find your tribe because Lori in like a hundred times by really really
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:11.160]   Yeah, I love that episode's best Star Wars in like 20 years. What do we think of wonder not wonder woman?
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.600]   What's uh, what's the girl in the river suit black widow?
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:15.880]   I liked it
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:19.560]   Good the remarkable thing to me is that they had a female they had a female producer with scarlet
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:22.920]   Your hands and they had a female director. They had female writers and when the women were together
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.000]   They had actual real conversation nice
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000]   Like about interesting things that we would talk about men. Yeah, good
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.800]   That killed green light
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:37.080]   Uh one last rumor before we get to your picks of the week apple watch and health executive kevin lynch
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:44.440]   Yep, according to uh business insider, which had the scoop being refocused to the apple car team
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:51.960]   Now he's a star. We saw a lot of him in the last apple event and apple watch certainly a success according to insider
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:56.280]   Uh, he it's not going to change his job. He's a vp of technology
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:04.360]   But his focus might shift towards he's handing health over to evan doll who have been director of health software recently
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.440]   And he's going to be helping out with
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:12.680]   Um titan because titan is like a whole bunch of parts as hardware. There's software. There's the the whole ai engine to it
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:17.560]   And he's he's very kevin is very thoughtful very good very focused on taking what could be
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.000]   Very complex things and making them super digestible
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:26.840]   Uh, so he's like an edward tuftian intellect in terms of making all of the stuff just well
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:30.760]   And I think a lot of egos on this team you've got john john and drea
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:37.640]   You've got the new guy from bmw. We're at cronc. So you've got some heavy hitters working. I guess apple
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:44.600]   Still there he was for a while. Yeah, that's right. Uh, you got some apple serious about these car ambitions. I guess we have to say
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.280]   Yeah, I keep a lot of money
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.760]   I still as as always I have I cannot pretend to have even as
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.680]   I guess as to why apple what apple wants to do with this project
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:49:02.280]   But the thing that always keeps me interested in this thing that this is a serious thing is knowing how many people got pulled out of very very heavy duty
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:04.840]   Successful rewarding
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:10.680]   Careers by by whatever the the keynote slide deck apple showed them to say yes, but yes
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:12.440]   I will leave this prestigious
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:18.360]   Position at this car company to come work for your top secret project that might not ever actually ship a product
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:24.360]   So that's always very interesting to me. The same thing with it. It attracts the top talent at apple. Although
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:27.320]   business insider was it
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.160]   Uh last
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:35.880]   Business sider had a report about how they there has been some reshuffling that some keep people have left the project
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.800]   So maybe this is a new talent coming into fill a vacuum
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:45.640]   German reported a hard problem last year. Yeah, but the thing is like like it's it's it is a car
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.200]   But it also the stuff that they're working on in terms of the autonomy
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:53.000]   It's ingesting the world around us understanding it contextualizing it and then acting and reacting to it
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.240]   And that's a lot of the stuff we're already seeing in the photos app and in uh live text
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:01.000]   It's all stuff from these AR and and autumn autumn mode of uh, sorry
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:08.440]   Autonomous technologies those are going to be the foundation blocks for everything apple does next from personal robots to the machines that make the machines
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:15.160]   To cars to shuttles. It's just it's a huge rnd project that a car will be like the prize consumer spin out from it
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:17.880]   But I think we'll be seeing the results for decades to come
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:19.000]   Yeah
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.640]   As always at ones apples big with strengths is as we as I said earlier that it's a very small group of top executives who know
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:29.080]   Everything going on with the company and they're not afraid of cross pollinating one
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:33.720]   one discovery one technology with another of us going to improve their portfolio of
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.320]   of
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.320]   of really good ideas
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:42.680]   Let's uh, let's get our picks of the week ready ladies and gentlemen
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.800]   Renee richy and the anaco
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.360]   Alex lindsey. I'm back from hawaii. Thank you. Alex for filling in for me
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.440]   uh
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.440]   Why don't you kick us off with a pick of the week?
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.040]   Um
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:01.480]   My pick of the week is made by its dream and I can always it says dream on the case
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:04.840]   So it's easy for me to remember, um, but it's dream fibonacci fibonacci
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:10.840]   So I get a certain kind of case. Um, and this is interesting
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:15.480]   So the I always get them with wallets, you know, so yeah, I find that yeah, I lose my phone
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:21.400]   And I lose my wallet, but I never lose my phone in my wallet. That's right. Oh, so, um, exactly the right
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:25.080]   I uh, I just got it last week and I'm just getting ready to put everything into it
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:27.080]   But it basically you have what I like about this one
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:29.880]   I have this old one this is venn and the problem with the venn
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.720]   This is the one i'm using using at the moment
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:33.720]   I'm gonna be swapping swapping them over
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:38.360]   But you kind of open this up and what's kind of nice is you open it up and you can roll it around and you can make it into a
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.200]   Thing and you can do it. Yeah, you know
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:42.200]   and the um
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.720]   so
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:46.680]   That is um, it's pretty that's a nice nice thing
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:49.880]   The it's hard
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:51.160]   Um, and it's big
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:54.360]   What's cool about this one that I really liked is that this dream
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.600]   Uh one here
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:00.280]   You can open it up and of course you now everything's on the side so i'm not open
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.920]   I can just open it up and grab my credit card or I can grab my
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.960]   Um, everything else but the other thing you can do is you can pull this out
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:11.800]   So if I want to if I need to put it into a little um, let's say an osmo or something else
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:16.920]   I can pull my phone out and simply um, you know and then put it back in as needed and it's just a lot easier
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:22.440]   I was like un basically pulling my other phone in and out because it was too heavy for my osmo specifically or any kind of
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:29.320]   Latch that I was trying to hook hook it on to and so being able to separate these out really really quickly and easily is is really nice
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:35.320]   It's a some kind of faux leather thing which is uh works well. It got nice. It has a nice little um, you know magnet that
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:39.560]   How strong is a magnet pretty good? It's strong enough. I mean, it's not yeah
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:44.440]   I mean no no no because it's it's it's like it's in here like it's not going anywhere
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:51.000]   Um, whatever the magnet is the metal or the magnet or wherever that's going is is strong, you know, and um
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.640]   And then you can pop it in and I
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:53:00.360]   Anyway, I find that that's a great mix and it's it's I think it's better than the venn which I've had for years
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:03.080]   I do something that's similar actually mentioned. This is a pick
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:08.840]   A while ago because I I want to still charge with the magsafe and now that the battery is out
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:10.920]   So I have a magsafe
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:12.920]   Case on the phone, but then I have a
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:20.520]   A leather right wallet case that has a magnet so it's the same idea, but it's not super secure
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:26.120]   This one this one's pretty I can't imagine it coming out. Yeah, that's about the same. Yeah, yeah
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:32.280]   Anyway, that's my pick very nice the dream dr. Double em fibonacci
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:35.720]   It's 44 bucks on amazon
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:40.520]   I will give you ant proot's pick of the week which he's just stuck in chat
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.600]   from uh
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:45.800]   Fjorden they're in asville aslonarve
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:51.640]   Fjorden faster camera controls on your iphone. I haven't played with this
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:56.680]   I don't know if ant has it's a kickstarter. Although they've raised a lot of money. They were looking for 23 000
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:59.080]   I've got 168 000 already
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:02.760]   It's viktor who is the founder of fjorden
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.720]   uh
[01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:08.680]   and apparently I guess uh you get dials knobs and all this stuff and uh
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:15.480]   A two-stage shutter button a control dial and a multifunction button that just snap on the back
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:19.160]   Of your iphone plus a kickstand
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:26.920]   Interesting. I don't know how it works, but ant thought that was worth paying attention to so i'll stick ant proot's pick of the week in here
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:28.760]   Andy you're next
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:34.280]   Uh a perennial favorite BB edit has just had another major release this week beginning in 14
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.880]   Uh
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:41.480]   If this is is a lot of podcasts and that feature writers particularly tech writers and programmers
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:48.040]   Uh, you're gonna get a diversion of two hours once the topic of BB that comes up because in the it's it's the it's the
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:51.640]   It's my favorite it's one of my favorite apps to write in
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:57.400]   Even though it is technically a excuse me one it's most popularly a programmers text editor
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:05.320]   But it is the ultimate app for for writing reading working with manipulating developing text files
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:08.760]   And I it's perfect because it gets out of your way
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:14.280]   Uh, so whenever I want to just simply open a window write something and then put it someplace else
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:17.240]   Uh, then that's the that's always my go-to app
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:22.040]   The it's also it's tools for manipulating text
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:27.480]   Like if search and replace is nice, but when you have like a long document and you want to
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:32.360]   Reformat all of the all the dollar figures all the all the character names in a script
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.480]   But depends on the context and where it is and how it is
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:42.360]   Uh, that's something that if you you can take just a minute or two to figure out how to do that with uh, BB edit's really really
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:45.800]   Innovative search and replace and search and replace recipes
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:51.320]   They've as usual when they when they do a huge release it's rarely
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:55.640]   It's rarely the sort of stuff or oh now we've added augmented reality now
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:00.760]   Just hold up your Mac and you can actually see what your text file would look like if it were on the billboard
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:06.600]   That's across the street. It's usually simple stuff in in response to a feedback from their users
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:11.800]   So there's a lot of stuff in the release notes that have to do with uh developers who are using a new tool that BB edit
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:15.240]   Supports well but could have supported better. So now that's really well supported
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:21.400]   Uh, but it's they're so focused on the user that there is a I know I know the the head of uh, barebone software
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:24.120]   Rich seagull very very well. He's one of my best friends
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:29.240]   And I have it's it felt as though in the release notes he was writing something to me because
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:31.640]   Uh, there's a new feature called notes
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:35.000]   For and it said it basically said well Andy do you know that how
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.280]   Often oftentimes like you just start you just start writing without actually creating a file
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:44.120]   And then you just count on bbs auto backup to just
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:48.520]   Restore it to your desktop whenever you launch and relaunch and restart
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:52.520]   Well, we decided to give you a whole new panel called notes to do all that stuff with
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.880]   So when you don't have a name or a title or purpose for something
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:57:00.600]   This is where you can put everything and will be automatically saved automatically restored automatically backed up
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:04.760]   It's again. I said stop you're gonna. I'm flattered
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:09.240]   I'm grateful, but if you're gonna remote access my mac at least tell me first dude
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:11.240]   That's that's actually part of the broker
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:14.440]   You might have been writing this to me too because that's actually one of the main reasons
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:18.520]   I use bb edict because it will reopen all those little files I created
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:22.760]   Big deal though. There is a big new feature in this support for lsp
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:24.440]   so as a
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.440]   Programming editor nerd
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:31.560]   One of the things that's happened in this space bb edict has been around forever and ever and ever
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:34.680]   but vs code microsoft's vs code
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:42.520]   Created a new language server protocol that made it very easy to add support for languages into vs code
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:45.160]   And as a result vs code has started to eat the world
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:47.880]   Uh in terms of programming editors
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:54.040]   So support for lsp is huge in an editor and bb edict 14 adds that and to me
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:58:00.520]   That is a big deal. It means i'm i'm just as likely to use bb edict as an envious code
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:04.360]   Huge and a lot of must have been a lot of work to implement that
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:11.720]   Honest to god if if if the if the simplest way to describe what you'd spend most of your day doing is typing on a keyboard and pushing a cursor to the right
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:15.320]   No matter what the context that is bb edict is has got your back cover
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.560]   And they've added dbucks 30 day free trial and after 30 days
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:24.040]   It doesn't stop working you just lose like the top 10 of the features that make it
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:31.160]   Go take it from awesome to double awesome. So yeah, and he and this is the paragraph for me added built-in language module for lisp
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:34.520]   So i'm very happy now lisp and thank you dot dot forever
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:38.440]   Really richy your pick of the weeks uh
[01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:45.960]   So i i stuck a i stuck a tiktok in there just because we were talking about it earlier and it was fascinating to me because just like we saw the stage
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:52.680]   Evolve into movies and the way that the language evolved we're seeing this whole new style of editing and visual language come from the short form
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:55.800]   uh, you know massively democratized videos and
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:57.880]   You know, it's probably too long to play the whole thing
[01:58:57.880 --> 01:59:01.000]   But it's basically someone complains about stitching on tiktok
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:08.280]   And so people just proceed to stitch and stitch and stitch and stitch the video making it bigger and funnier
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:15.160]   Oh, because people do these duets so you'll stitch in one you do you'll stitch an existing video to another one
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:21.800]   So she's stitching her own videos to herself. Well, the other people are doing that like they're oh, that's not her
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:24.280]   Oh, that's great
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:34.760]   This is the ultimate stitching video involving lego dogs pregnant bellies
[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:39.720]   And uh some guy singing sea shannies i'm hoping but we'll see
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:43.640]   You look like watching that tiktok. Oh my god, that's hysterical
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:46.360]   The ultimate stitching
[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:51.240]   I don't need to know what you look and there's several like this they just like that someone complains about something and the entirely gets
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:53.240]   Nice hand to effect with
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:56.920]   And so the original videos now just tell you looking at the great top of this massive
[01:59:56.920 --> 02:00:04.440]   This is what makes tiktok great is that kind of uh collaborative
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:09.640]   Spirit remixing spirit that really is up to three minutes. Yeah, enough to three minutes
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:12.200]   Just two minutes 10 seconds long to fuck. Yeah
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:17.720]   I use it ends when you get to three minutes, right? Like that's the whole thing is like, yeah, you know what you'll be over by then
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:23.000]   I rarely get to minute three. I have to say of any tiktok. I get stressed. I have for a minute
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.840]   I don't like 30 seconds. Yeah. Yeah
[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:28.200]   I get stressed if I look at something that's going slowly and I think it's going to be more than a minute
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:30.200]   I just skip it because i'm just like
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:33.880]   Like this is this is gonna be too long like I didn't come here for this. So we talked about that
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:39.320]   I think before it's like they've had to re-envision storytelling for the streaming generation because you don't have people in a movie theater
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:43.240]   You know, just inclined to leave and you could do these slow burn stories now
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:45.320]   Like they said like they're people aren't worried about spoilers
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:49.080]   They want to be told what they're getting up front and then built up to it throughout the thing
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:52.200]   But they want that payoff immediately or they're gonna click onto something else
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.760]   You have to you have to earn their attention right away
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:56.600]   And like and like for me like I
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:00.200]   Probably half an hour tiktok a day and it's like the end of my day kind of thing and
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.680]   If I see part one, I just immediately skip it
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:06.840]   Because I'm like now i'm gonna have to go find part two inside of there whatever
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:10.280]   Which is what they want you to do, right? That's the behavior, but i'm like assuming too much trouble
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:14.760]   Like I don't care what you're saying. Unless it's like someone found a secret apartment inside her bathroom cupboard
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:16.760]   You know, it's like yeah, that was the same thing
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:23.320]   The other thing um I was gonna mention quickly is because the world is starting to open back up slowly and carefully
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:29.080]   I've been using James Thompson's dice app on the iPhone and it's magnificent but Steve trot and smith linked to
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:34.600]   Um blanking on the name right now everything dice they're getting ready to release their new collection their
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:38.600]   Handmade sharp edge dice that are just absolutely

[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:54.520]   and nebulas and

[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:00.680]   Uh
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:05.880]   I think we can say hello and goodbye at the same time because we have come to the end
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:11.160]   That's by the way what aloha means we have come to the end of our fabulous
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:13.880]   Aloha spirit podcast

[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:33.000]   Anything you guys mistake yesterday leo what'd you do?
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.200]   I forgot about I forgot about pose law
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:38.360]   What's pose law?
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:43.000]   That's that no matter how sarcastic you make something on the internet a small percentage of people will believe it is accurate
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.080]   And I made a I made a video because there's so many like outrageous youtube titles for apple videos lately
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:56.200]   So I made a video titled the truth about insanely great m1x iphone 13 price and release date confirmed leak bombs or apple's master plan
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:58.360]   To finally end facebook don't make a mistake
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:02.760]   We're gonna get that that's a joke
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:07.000]   No, there was like I'd say 30 percent of people were super angry. I didn't deliver on that title
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000]   Oh lord
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:15.960]   Can I can I say that I saw that I saw that video in that title come up in my my youtube panel and I thought oh my god rene has finally lost
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.960]   YouTube is finally it was like eaten away from his brainstem
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.840]   So what I actually did is for the first time like I described my own personal youtube strategy
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:28.360]   I've been researching youtube for like the last two years away I researched apple
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:31.160]   And I figured out a lot of I think I figured a lot of how it works
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:35.800]   And I wanted to explain to people why you see titles like that so often and so repetitively
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:40.360]   In your thing, but some people were like not having it just not having that's so funny
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:44.680]   It was by far my most popular like it was 10 times more popular than any video i've done in the last six months though
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:49.720]   Ah see it works. Obviously it works those titles work. Did you change the title? I don't see it
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:54.120]   Yeah, no, I changed I had to shorten it because youtube only allows so many characters
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:58.920]   And then people were actually angry that I wasn't explaining how facebook was over so I switched the name to youtube
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:07.480]   It's the second uh, I just I just just put up a video explaining pegasets and it's a video right before that. Ah, okay, okay
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:10.120]   I hear I see it
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:16.680]   Mm, M1x iPhone 13 press confirms apples master plan leak bomb titles youtube algorithm explained and i'm showing
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:20.280]   Yeah, i'm showing all those exact those exact words and all these titles
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:24.760]   That's the whole video
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:26.920]   No, I
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:31.080]   Actually, I want to watch this because i'm trying to learn this youtube stuff. This is uh
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:34.440]   Is it 58? This is a did I read that right is a 58 out?
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:40.360]   58,000 views. Yes in like 12 hours put it up. You put it up yesterday. Yeah
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:46.680]   No, but you realize we're named them now. This has put you in a very very delicate spot
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:54.200]   I know you chose that title just to be sarcastic, but now you're like oh damn how I made how much more money on for this video
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:56.600]   I looked into that place. I dare not look
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:04:59.640]   Well, the nice thing about sponsors I get paid the same thing no matter how the video performs
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:01.800]   So i'm not right incentivized to clickbait
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:05.400]   But I do feel like I looked at the beast and the beast looked back and now I don't know what
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:10.360]   I saw I put up a very a very somber talk about pegasus today just to to make sure my
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:13.240]   Even if i gained yesterday. Yeah
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:18.680]   Friends oh, I forgot I got to introduce the other people andy and not go
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:23.560]   Almost said goodbye andy and i go when are you gonna be on wgbh next?

[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:34.680]   Thank you, andrew
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:40.680]   And of course if you're interested in all things production oriented you've got to check out office hours
[02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:46.120]   Alex lindsey's amazing office hours dot global for more information. It's a youtube
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:51.800]   Uh live stream no a zoom live stream which you can join but you can also watch it later on youtube
[02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:56.040]   You can watch it live on youtube as well. So you can every morning. Yes 7 a.m pacific standard time
[02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:58.680]   There's there's two hours on youtube that's live
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:02.360]   We start a couple hours early. We actually have started testing
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:05.000]   24/7 so we um
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:11.800]   So we are changing in august we're changing from we have a pre-show or really what we call the pre-pre-show at 5 a.m
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:14.760]   And then at 9 a.m. We have the post show
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:19.800]   And instead we're just getting rid of those and there's going to be office hours and after hours
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:23.640]   And so what we're finding is that after hours is very popular
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:27.880]   So so um, so anyway, we just leave it open and it's it's kind of slow content
[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:33.880]   But we have things like like people get in there and they start working and they put something up while they're working and everyone watches and asks questions
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:35.880]   And then there's quite you know, there's and we had
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:38.120]   Sunday afternoon. We had like 50 people watching
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:43.240]   JJ who's who works at oh nine oh making SDI cables
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.800]   Just making them
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:50.840]   And just kind of working away and so uh so that you know it's it's small right now
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:56.200]   But we're feeling it's going to get pretty big because people enjoy it and what we're noticing now is people are talking about putting in like a
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:59.880]   You know an iPad or like a little computer that just sits there connected
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:01.880]   all the time
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:04.120]   So um, you know that you you turn off
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:09.400]   It's like it's like having an open office where you can actually shut the virtual door and open it whenever you feel like it
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:12.680]   Um, but what's great is people are talking they'll be sitting there working
[02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:16.280]   I've been kind of quietly watching, you know some of the stuff they'll be sitting and working and they go
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:20.760]   I don't understand this and someone just immediately answers and like i just just do this this this and this and this and
[02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:24.200]   Then you're and they go back to what they're doing and so it's not always that they're even talking
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:29.560]   So so that's our new next next little experiment is is being on all the time
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:32.280]   But that really is coming off the hours. I mean, that's really
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:37.240]   Yeah, except that the hours are 24, but other than that it's really office hour 24/7
[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:43.240]   Yeah, it was just yeah, yeah, and we we just started experimenting with it and it's more successful than we expected
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:45.240]   So we'll probably be more of it very nice
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:52.920]   Thank you all for being here. Uh, we do mac break weekly of a tuesday morning around 11 am pacific 2 pm eastern
