[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   This is MacBreak Weekly, the show that covers all things
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   like Macintosh, whether it be Macintosh, iPhone, the
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Suez Canal, the price of tea in China, all of that.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I'm Leo LaPorte, joining us now in studio, Mr. Alex
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Linze.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Thepixelcore.com.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Hi.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   It's going to be back.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Welcome back.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   It feels like a lifetime.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's only one week.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I know.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   It was just going to turn.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I know.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Well, we missed you.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   You know who's gone longer than you.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Scott Born, first his truck got towed.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   [laughter]
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And then he had dial up Wi-Fi.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Yes, I went to the only hotel in the United States, Leo,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   in Florida that offered dial up Wi-Fi.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It seems a contradiction in terms, but do not be fooled.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   When I am so glad to be back this week.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So glad to have you back.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I'm very excited because there's big Mac news, I'm sure.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Of which you are unaware, but nevertheless, we will fill you in.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I've been in Florida, so I don't know.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   There's no Macs in Florida.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Actually, I had a great story.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I went, there was this old couple and I mean old, as in, you know what the great thing
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   about Florida is?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Everybody there is actually older than me.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   They were sitting on a park bench with a laptop and it was an air.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It was an air.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Wow.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Well, those old folks need to have something light, you know.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   That was cool.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That's my Mac experience that and the fact that, of course, I took my soon-to-be-replaced
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   MacBook Pro with me and it was its last journey because the 17-inch arrives tomorrow.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Oh boy.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Speaking of arrivals, the Kindle has arrived.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   The Kindle has landed at Andy Inacos Bachelor Pad.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Hey Andy.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Hey there, Leo.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yes, I was on my out the door and my UPS guy like met me at the end of the driveway and handed over a Kindle 2.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I'm so jealous.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Mine comes tomorrow.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   But we will get your thoughts, your first thoughts, and maybe you can play us some audio of the Kindle reading.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Cool.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'll find something really dirty.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Then she said yes.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   She said yes.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Didn't family Anderson write it?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I'll see if I can buy that on WhisperNet while we're talking.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Do you have a choice of a male or female voice?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I have not checked it.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I've listened to the voice and it sounds like a very good Macintosh Pro voice.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   The only bad thing about it is it's certainly not going to be a replacement for audio books by any way.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I think it's more like an accessibility feature for people with vision problems.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Oh, that's so interesting.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   You'll hear it in time.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Somebody said it sounds like the robot in Lost in Space a little bit.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Not like that robot.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   The only...
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I listened to it for about two or three minutes.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   The cool thing is that the text actually follows along with you while the voice goes.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't understand that a period means you stop for a little while.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Put a little air between the period.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Well, there you go.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   That's sometimes that happens.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   We have to start our show with a birthday greeting, a happy birthday to Mr. Steven Jobs, who is 54 today.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I just realized he's younger than me.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Yeah, he's two years older than me.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   But according to Malcolm Gladwell and Outliers, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and others who are in that early 50s.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   We're the perfect age to start the computer revolution.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So happy birthday.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   That's the only reason why I didn't start the computer revolution.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You're too young.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   You missed it.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   It's all like an old boys network.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   You get into the club or you don't get into the club.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   You didn't have a chance.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I realized that I was...
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   My fight was good.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Four times is good.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   You're at wait a minute.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   How old are you?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I'm 39.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You were on August '07.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You're too young.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Now when the computer revolution started.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Yes, I was thinking of starting it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   No, I was like Steve Jobs.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Yeah, we were 22.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   We were thereabouts, right?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   No, he was 18.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   77.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Yeah, and I was...
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Well, no, wait a minute.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I'm doing that wrong.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   He was 20.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I think it would have been right.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   What year was he born?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I know.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So complex.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   That is hard.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   With my understanding of being a...
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   He would have been born in '54, so he would have been 23 and I would have been 21 or 22 in
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   '77 and that was a perfect age.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   You didn't have an investment in the status quo and yet...
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And you had the energy to start something new and yet you also were old enough.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You weren't seven years old.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Yeah, see, exactly.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   You actually had an opportunity to make a difference.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I think that's...
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   You know, he has some merit there.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Although I mentioned this to the very young Ryan Shroud at PC perspective and he said,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   "Well, just wait and see what our generation does."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And he had a very excellent point.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   You know, it's easy for us to say, "Oh, yeah, well, you know, you had to be that age to
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   start the revolution."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Who knows what the next revolution is going to be?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Also, a big story.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   The Mac Mini.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Now, have you guys seen the video?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   We saw a back plate of the rumored Mac Mini.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It looks like one of those, you know, things you plug a bunch of extension cords into.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Well, but then I saw the video and the video kind of made it...
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It's one thing to do with Photoshop.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   But somebody pointed out, look, in fact, there was some very deep analysis of this Mac Mini
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   back plate.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And one person said, "Look, the display port is at a different level than the VGA adapter.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   That would be pretty hard to do unless you put a riser on the motherboard.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And you wouldn't do that.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It wouldn't make sense to do that.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   You just do that in line."
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Then other people used Photoshop.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   You might be interested in this, Alex, to analyze the artifacting.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And the artifacting was different in different parts of the picture.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   So the presumption being that different JPEGs could be were stitched together.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   However, now there's a video which, you know, that's a little harder to fake.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Although, you know, they don't lift it up.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   They just slowly rotate it.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I don't know if it's...
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I think maybe one of the reasons these kinds of rumors really have some legs is because people
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   want it.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It's just a measure of how much people want this thing.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I'm ready to buy a few more minis and I'm trying to hang out.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I love the minis.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And I'd like to buy two or three more.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So I'm hoping this happens soon.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We're building mini PCs for multiple skipes.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   But if they were Mac minis, I would be very interested in doing that.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   S-video out.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   We're now using S-video out of... for the switcher.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Instead of doing the IVGA, we switch to an S-video thing.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And the movement is smoother.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   You know, it's just a whole lot nicer looking.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And if I could, you know, do an S-video on a Mac, I would just... on force.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So we're going to have S-video on force Skype machines so we have a better video.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   But that's kind of inside baseball anyway.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   So credibility?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Yes, no.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   The Mac mini?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   What do you think, Mr. Ennaco?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Is that... did you see the pictures?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Actually, I haven't seen the pictures though.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Nobody's seen the pictures.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I have.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   What did you think?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I thought it looked...
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I did the Photoshop wizard.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   You know, I didn't dig into it as deep as everyone else.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   When I saw the image, I was kind of like, "Oh, I don't..." you know, whatever.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We'll see.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   When I saw the video, I was kind of like, "Well, it looks pretty possible."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   It did.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   You know, if it's not real, wow, someone's got way too much time on their hands.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   That's all I have to say.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Okay, so as a video and Photoshop guy, I mean, you'd be probably better equipped than many to detect.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I have to admit, I just kind of, you know, was one of those things like I saw it.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I looked at it and then I moved on.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   So I didn't dig into it.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   I mean, obviously any of this could be done by someone who can... you know, I used to work at an effects company that built stuff.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Yeah, but it's...
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   So, I mean, but they're using pretty simple tools to do a lot of that.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   But to do it at that level, I think would be... it's just a lot of work.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   So it's either real or...
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Or somebody has a big commitment to...
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Someone has an insane amount of time on their hands.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I mean, this is...
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I think the hardest thing for Apple is you have to remember that a lot of this stuff is being built in China or Taiwan
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   where people are making not very much money.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's not, you know, it's very hard to keep all of that, you know, capped in.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I'm actually amazed that Apple keeps it as tight as they do.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   So there it is.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And the back plane, you know, I mean, okay, that may have been a Photoshop, but they've built a model if they...
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Well, let me see.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   I mean, do you think this whole thing could be done?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   No, there's a hand in it.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   The whole...
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   You wouldn't... the thing is that you wouldn't... it's handheld.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   If you were going to do that as an effect, let's say you want to build a 3D thing,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   the average person doing this would have not done a handheld.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   They would have done a... they would have locked the camera off.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Yeah, the camera is very cheap.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   You have the person interacting with it.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   I mean, that's a lot.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   That's a very complex thing.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   In this case, this would have to be a physical model, I think, for that to be a fake.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Yeah, a half a...
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And that's...
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And that's a pretty good physical model.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I want that sold, the fact that those two display ports are not at the same height.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I mean, they may have a completely different setup internally and need for where that plug goes in.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   So I'm not totally sold, but that's a problem.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   It makes it harder to manufacture.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   We're talking about the thing.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   But that's never stopped, Apple.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Exactly.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   The failure rates on some of the components of these...
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I heard a rumor that the failure rate on the trackpad is above 50%.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Is it really?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Really?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So Apple doesn't care about how hard it is to make it.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I mean, the failure rate before it goes out the door.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   No, they all work, but to get it through.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   So I read that on some rumor site somewhere.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   But the point is that Apple is designed first in difficulty.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   What do you put?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   What processor?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   You have a Core 2 in the current Mac minis.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Do you go up to the Nihalim, the i7 Intel processor?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   No, that would be crazy.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   You're just going to keep a Core 2 in there.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I don't think you have to go that much.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Maybe a quad core.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Yeah, maybe a quad core.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I don't think you have to make it that much faster.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I mean, it does what it does very well.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   You know, I think that as a media, I mean, putting the new display ports, putting in the new way to interact.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Five USB ports.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I mean, that I guess is because it's a, what, a multimedia machine?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Yeah, I mean, I run out of on the Mac minis that I have.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I run.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   But I mean, what are they saying about this?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   We were making a USB.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's had an 800, a firewall 800 in.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Well, that seems to me a media center, right?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   The other thing is that you have that many USB ports to share.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   You have two to use and about three to share.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   So if you wanted to use it as the thing that plugs into your TV, but you also keep your printer
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   near there, you also keep your scanner sort of near there, all kinds of other stuff that
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   we share through the OS.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Really put you in a perfect position as a media server.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I mean, I'm, I think the Apple TV is really cool.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.600]   But if I had the choice between an Apple TV, I don't, you know, to get what I really want
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   is a Mac mini because.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.000]   In fact, if I'm Apple, I might say, let's discontinue the Apple TV because it's.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And take what you've learned from the Apple TV.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And push the mini sales as I don't.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I wouldn't go that far unless you're going to sell the mini for 200 bucks.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.600]   There are a lot of people, if you're selling the mini as a computer, there are people who
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.600]   will never spend five or six hundred dollars for a computer that goes under their TV.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.900]   There are a lot of people who'd spend 200 dollars as they're used to spending that kind
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.000]   of money money for a video component.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So that's very.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Here's a, here's a, here's a possibility.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.200]   We know that Apple will have access to this new platform from Nvidia called the ION platform.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.000]   It's, it's really for netbooks.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.360]   It is not a core to.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.600]   It's an atom processor.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.880]   Although you can get a dual core atom processor at the highest end.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.880]   But it's a slower processor.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.480]   It has the built in Nvidia and 9400 chipset, which means it for graphics.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.800]   It has a hardware decoding of H.264.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.280]   It's everything is on the chipset.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.560]   It's a very inexpensive platform.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.280]   And it's actually an ideal home theater platform.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.240]   Maybe Apple will do a low end Mac mini at a, what would the price point need to be if
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.960]   you're going to discontinue Apple TV.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.800]   Maybe make a Mac mini slash Apple TV with a 250 gig drive.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.040]   I still think that's more of a table 50.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.520]   I think it's more of a tablet processor than a, than a, you mean a netbook processor?
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.360]   Well, I don't think Apple's going to make a netbook.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360]   Right.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.600]   I think they're going to make tablets and some kind of factor.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.800]   I also don't think they're interested in low end very much.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.680]   Steve Jobs has said a million times we're not a low end company.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.480]   I think they should be interested in the home theater market, don't you think?
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   Oh, they should be.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.280]   And in fact, if the rumors on the TV are true, then that's what, that's where this all starts
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.360]   to gel for me.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.120]   This makes a perfect companion to the new Apple TV.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.900]   I mean, really, you're almost there with a, I mean, when you think about a, a slightly
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:57.280]   larger I'm back, you're almost there, you know, to just, just have the I'm back be something
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.000]   you can hang up on the wall.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.720]   Well, the, the, the brilliant idea now, Asus once showed me a machine that I thought was
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.640]   just brilliant, where it's the ugliest Windows PC you've ever seen.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.080]   And that's sort of saying something when you see, you know, the case design's coming
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.080]   out of Korea.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.960]   And I don't want to look like just a, you know, just a device instead of a desktop PC.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.440]   And they said, oh yeah, well, I mean, you don't see these big holes on the side on the
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.440]   back.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.440]   Well, actually you're not meant to ever see it.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.560]   They have the same mounting brackets as a standard HDTV would have.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.680]   So the idea is that you actually mount this behind whatever HDTV you want.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.320]   And it turns it into a perfectly media capable Windows PC without ever seeing any wires or
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   anything.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.080]   So if Apple were to, if Apple could possibly restrain themselves from having to design
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.760]   something that looks pretty, that just made a, just took our nose, their face out there
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.080]   and said, we're going to do an actual, we're going to do the, here it is.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.920]   We're, we, it's something we never thought we'd do a boring gray box.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.680]   But we did it that way because you'll never going to see it.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.760]   How about that would be?
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.760]   How about this?
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.280]   Maybe put it in an Apple two disk drive box.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.280]   That was a cool.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   Wasn't that cool?
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.200]   But, but the, the, just to just to button it off, the only thing that would be against
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.520]   that though would be that I don't, I'm not sure if Apple would ever want to do a machine
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.400]   where you could not see an Apple logo.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.840]   No, they wouldn't.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   They wouldn't.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.440]   So that's why you make a screen.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.440]   That's true.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.440]   That drive, that drive mod is awesome.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.680]   Isn't that, isn't that fantastic?
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.480]   That's on a, from a Gizmodo.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.480]   I don't like this.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.320]   I want to just, I can storage and now I'm like, oh, maybe I do want to make me.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.120]   Look at this.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.120]   That's so cool.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.320]   You just take apart the Mac mini, you put it in an Apple two disk drive course, you have
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.680]   to have a Apple two full height disk drive just lying around somewhere.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.960]   Right, but it, but it looks like he didn't really have to do much, but strip off the
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   external case.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.200]   That's almost exactly the right size.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:49.280]   He, he added one little bit of rewiring so that the power light on the Mac mini actually
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.320]   operates the LED in front of the disk too.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.320]   He installed our switch on the back, but it looks like one of these like one hour long
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   projects.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   It is.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.320]   It looks very simple.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.640]   It's not, there's not a lot of soldering involved.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.760]   It's just a new outside for the Mac mini.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.360]   It's probably a better, better cooling as a matter of fact.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.280]   You've improved the cooling on this Mac mini by encasing it in an Apple two disk drive.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.120]   But of course, like when you do this mod, your startup sound has to be big.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.920]   Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.520]   Finding zero sector.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.240]   Did the Apple two drives do the thing?
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.480]   The first thing it had to do was slam, slam the heads like you two like exactly that would
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.520]   zero the heads.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.520]   Clock.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.300]   And then you had to remember you could make them double sided with a whole bunch.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.300]   Exactly.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.300]   Good old days.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:42.420]   You have 540 megabytes of gigabytes if you just drill a hole and just go to go to a band
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.420]   song.
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.500]   Just cut a notch in the side of the drive.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.100]   So the other big story and as you mentioned, it happened just before we got on the air.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.780]   But I think a few of us have had a chance to play with Safari four is out in public beta.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:59.660]   In fact, if you go to apple.com slash Safari, you will not be offered Safari three, even
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.020]   though it's a public beta, you know, and do not use this blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.740]   It is the official download version of Safari.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:14.380]   It's not offered through Apple update yet, but but Windows users and Mac users are now
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.060]   going to be offered the new Safari.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.060]   You know, now I just want to point out that when you download the Safari installer, notice
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.940]   how it says Safari 4.0 beta Leo.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.940]   They really are aiming it at me.
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.940]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.940]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.940]   It's the Leo version.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.620]   They use an upgraded soon.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.100]   They knew that this I wanted this and yeah, that's right.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.540]   You're going to upgrade it.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.940]   I played with a little bit.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:45.220]   I mean, it's, you know, the biggest selling point is it's a lot faster in JavaScript.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.300]   But these are really speed improvements that the WebKit had already kind of done.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:57.820]   According to Daniel Jalkut in on Twitter, he says it actually breaks WebKit by replacing
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.380]   a WebKit and the LibXML libraries.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.820]   Maybe not breaks, but it does interact with some of the WebKit stuff.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.780]   And you need to be totally up to date or you can't install it.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.580]   Yeah, they make you install the new security.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.580]   Security update.
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.580]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.580]   You have to use the new Java update too, don't you?
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.580]   I believe so.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.900]   I think all of it has to be up to completely up to date today to install.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.900]   I'm getting.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.900]   They did push through.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.740]   They did push through both a security and a Java update onto a software update and they
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.500]   say there for security reasons and compatibility.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.060]   So I'm assuming that that's what it's for.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.180]   Well, and they, this kind of bug made it requires a restart.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.900]   This is a very windows-y kind of a thing to do.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.780]   You actually have to restart your machine after you install it.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.740]   Did they make you click through a new Yula?
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.860]   No, although I just got a new Yula from iTunes.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.820]   I didn't even have a new version of iTunes.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.660]   I get new Yulas all the time from iTunes.
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.660]   It seems like it's a kind of a classic change of target.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.260]   Yeah, I get one like every couple of days.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.260]   So I officially.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:03.020]   I don't, I'll talk about this later on, but I wanted to rail the conversation, but I've
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.780]   officially passed my pissed off point with iTunes now.
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.780]   Really?
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.260]   Well, we'll put that off a little bit later.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.260]   Let's finish so far.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.260]   I didn't.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.260]   Let's dig in.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.260]   Dig in.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.780]   So now I really like what they've done with history.
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.740]   You have cover flow in your history.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.540]   So as you go back through your old bookmarks and your old visited pages, you'll actually
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.380]   see thumbnails of them in a cover flow, which is very cool.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.380]   They've changed.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.380]   I'm not sure this is an improvement.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:34.780]   They've changed the location of the tab bar used to be right at the top of the browser
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.860]   window, which is right where your mouse wanted it to be.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.460]   Now it's at the very top of the window.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.260]   It's above everything else in the window.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.260]   I'm not.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.260]   That's what everybody's complaining about.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.140]   I don't understand that that change.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.940]   It actually looks like it breaks Apple's UI guidelines, doesn't it?
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.940]   How do you drag it around?
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.180]   I'm looking at a screenshot of it right now and I don't know how.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.780]   Anybody clicking the corner?
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.740]   See how that corner is ridged?
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.740]   That's bull.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.740]   That's stupid.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.740]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.580]   That is a huge mistake and they should be slapped hard for it.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:07.420]   You still can do that little number that you did where although I don't know.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.660]   Now I'm looking at that.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.780]   What is the only instance in which that would make sense where you would not want to have
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.180]   a draggable content of the window?
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.300]   If you have Safari on a device that has its binary full screen device that has no draggable
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.300]   window content.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.220]   It's possible that we're seeing a preview of a browser that we're going to be seeing
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.980]   on let's say handheld device with a large screen that will be showing one window of
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.980]   content at a time.
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.500]   That is touch based.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.380]   So that case you'd want to reduce the movement zone.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.140]   Well basically it would be wasted space and Apple always wants to make sure that you have
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.900]   sort of the same user experience on all devices.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:49.020]   It might also and here in boy am I talking crap now but it would also make sense for
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.940]   an Apple TV like device where again you're not going to be using a mouse to drag windows
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:53.940]   around.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.660]   You're fundamentally looking at a one window performance.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:03.540]   So if that's the reason then I'm willing to say it's probably a mistake to do it that
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.620]   way on the Mac but I see why they did it.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.020]   If they did it just to do it then it's a stupid idea.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.740]   I'm just not used to Apple doing stuff except for this one problem with iTunes.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.100]   I'm not used to them doing stupid things like that.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.860]   It does seem fast I tried it on Gmail, Gmail complains a little bit as Gmail has been wanted
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.100]   to do with Safari but seems to work okay.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.060]   My software is up to date on the other machine so I'm going to download it on my iMac.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.940]   I can't download it on this Mac because my software is not up to date but I want to show
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:37.820]   people a little bit of the cover flow stuff people who are watching at home says anything
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.420]   else you want to say about this?
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:46.940]   And it isn't a required update when you download it you get an uninstaller along with the installer.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.900]   I've already seen a couple of people on Twitter who said I'm uninstalling it.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:58.660]   Somebody said it broke, I don't know if this is isolated or not but he said it broke his
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.660]   mail application.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.860]   I don't think that happened to me.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.900]   Did he have a mail application that worked?
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.660]   How did he know?
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.660]   Is that your question?
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.660]   How did he know?
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.660]   Because I'm still waiting for mine to work.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.940]   I use mail like crazy.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.100]   Apple mail is my mail.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:20.340]   I find that it gets unstable and over 1.2 million pieces of mail.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.060]   Is that really the limit?
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.060]   It's the limit for me.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.020]   1.2 million pieces of mail.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.540]   It starts to degrade.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.460]   It seems like that would be a likely.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.380]   Well here's my problem with mail.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.460]   I click on the get mail button.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.260]   When I do that on every other mail client I get my mail.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.900]   When I do it on Apple's mail nothing happens.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.900]   Then like 10 minutes later I hear a ding.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.660]   It seems to be a little slow.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.260]   Do you have the little progress bar showing?
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.100]   No, nothing happens.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.540]   You've got to have the little progress bar.
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.700]   Then you know what's going on.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.780]   Yeah, there's the activity window.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.620]   I love the activity window.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.620]   Well the activity when I say you're not getting any mail dude.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.620]   You're screwed.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.460]   I ain't got no activity and then all of a sudden I got activity.
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.980]   It's a weird thing with mail like that.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.980]   I use mail with iMap.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.900]   I have to say well it's not ideal.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.300]   You have to open and close a folder for it to get the new mail.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.700]   It's still better than almost any other iMap program.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.340]   It may be Thunderbird.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.100]   iMap I guess is tough to do well.
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.380]   I do think mail has some cool features.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.100]   It's improved quite a bit but I don't think it's quite there.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.700]   I use it religiously.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.420]   You know, use it over Gmail?
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.540]   Yes, in fact this morning you would be glad you used it over Gmail.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.780]   Gmail was down for several hours and the only people were getting their Gmail where people
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.460]   using iMap or pop clients.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.740]   So there was no web interface to Gmail.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.660]   That's not the first time that's happened by the way.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.660]   But it's got to make companies that are moving to Gmail.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.860]   I think a lot of companies are.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.580]   Want to think twice.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.900]   If you can't make it happen with any mail service that you use.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.900]   True.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:02.420]   The thing is if you really are using the web as your mail service and you can't get even
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.420]   to your old email.
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.140]   That's why I kind of like everything on my computer is because I want to be able to.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.300]   It's an issue with cloud computing frankly.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.020]   One other thing that does break for sure is one password.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.900]   But you know how fast they are at actual.
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.580]   They will update that probably by the end of the day.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.820]   They'll figure out what's breaking and what can we do to fix it.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:27.940]   By the way I don't know if this is us but apple.com seems to be down.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.380]   We sent so many people to download the new safari.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.380]   This is a new.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.380]   Oh for God.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.380]   So yeah.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.620]   Water shed apple.com could not take the traffic.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.380]   This is a new watershed in the pod.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.380]   You hear that?
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.140]   You hear that Amazon eBay you want to continue to operate.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.140]   Do me a favor.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.100]   Do me a favor Andy go to apple.com see if it's working for you.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.300]   Because that maybe someone says it's working fine for them on the.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.300]   No it's just us.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   It's just us.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.540]   It won't come up for me.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.540]   Oops.
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.980]   Alright so many of these people saying it's working.
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.700]   So I don't know why it's not working in our room.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.700]   Maybe apple.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.740]   Yeah okay so something I'm doing.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.900]   But it's frozen solid here.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:13.340]   I mean our threats against Amazon and eBay stand.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.660]   We haven't given up the URLs to your sites yet but we will at the end of the show unless
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.660]   we see.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.660]   Are you joking?
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.660]   Are you sure?
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.020]   Are you sure you're not thinking about AAPL?
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.020]   There Leo is that what you're typing in?
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.020]   He's joking.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.020]   I believe it's spelled APPLE.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:33.500]   How is the apple stock price by the way?
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.660]   Up three and a half I don't own any shares but I'm kind of wishing I did.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.020]   Wow three and a half that's pretty good.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.740]   And 90.39 as we speak.
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.700]   Nowhere near of course where I sold but that's okay.
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   There it is.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.740]   Oh as soon as I showed apple on the screen they let it pop up.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.260]   Wow that's a so it's not anywhere.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.940]   It's not even at 100 yet right?
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:26:01.180]   No no but you know considering that today the market is exactly one half the value it
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.460]   was like I don't know seven years ago.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.300]   For apple stock to be one half what it was.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.820]   I think it was last year ain't bad.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.060]   Isn't it close to 12 years ago?
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.540]   It's at the point it was in 97.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.540]   Yeah that's right.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.300]   So it's not one half of it's at the point it was 97.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.660]   It might be half of 2002.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:26.860]   It's lost I know what it is it's lost half of its value since the peak in 2000.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.860]   That's probably right.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.540]   Yeah that's what it is.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.140]   All I know is that it sucks.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.140]   I think good.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.020]   I think good for our team.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.980]   And I'm very glad that I invested in all that sand.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.020]   Some day sand is going to really be valuable.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.620]   You mean not silicon just sand?
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.660]   Just I bought sand it was cheap.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.620]   You know we have a lot of sand.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:54.860]   We have a listener his name is Mick we call him Mick the wick because when he retired he
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:01.140]   bought several tons of candle wax and he has it in his backyard and he now has been
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.940]   making candles ever since.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.780]   Well he's got it he's got a potential income there and when things get really apparently
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:11.420]   paraffins very cheap if you buy enough of it.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:16.180]   Does he live in Arizona or I'm a little bit worried about him like whether all that care
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.060]   he's got to have a really shiny backyard after some summer I think he lives in rural
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.820]   Ohio but I think it does get fairly warm there.
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.740]   I don't know exactly what what the mix plan is.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:33.700]   Mick what is your plan what is it what happens when it gets hot does your wax melt.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.740]   Or is it just a place to hide the body sir.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.740]   Yeah you know I think somewhere in case to the bottom.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.500]   Shout out we shout out we think very deep side there that you're just not prompted to
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.500]   look too close.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.500]   Floating in there.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:51.740]   What happened to Josh our FedEx guy he never delivers around here anymore.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.300]   So I want to get to the Kindle too but but why Andy are you so distraught and so upset
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.500]   and so miffed at iTunes.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.740]   It's a sort of thing where you sort of there's a there's a small problem and you figure okay
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.420]   this is obviously such a such an annoying problem that they're going to fix this soon
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.220]   or the reason why this is a problem is a complex and really really subtle one and it's going
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.540]   to take a long time for it to be shaken out or they'll say well it's much easier for us
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.460]   to just rewrite the thing and we're going to do a rewrite next year so that's when we'll
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.700]   do it.
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.940]   But I just found out that the reason why I and so many other people when we try to buy
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:29.940]   things via the iTunes store or via our iPhones it tells us this code has been disabled for
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.940]   security purposes.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.460]   Oh the reason now I found out the reason why that happens and this and by the way this
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.540]   happens every time I try to use the iTunes store if I haven't used it in like in a day
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.540]   or two.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:46.860]   Every single time the reason why is because I did what Apple I think said to do when they
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.940]   start when they started up me.com mobile me they said well if you have a dot Mac account
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.620]   you can just create a brand new mobile me account with your same username.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:29:00.780]   So if you have the same username on both accounts it will cause iTunes to get kerfuffled and
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:07.980]   shut down access to your purchasing and so it's it's annoying and on a after about a
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:13.500]   year of this happening it becomes galling because the only way to fix it is you click
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.620]   now I'm going for effect here but I'm really annoyed here because you click up on says
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.420]   forgot your did you forget your password.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:27.420]   Oh don't worry a lot of you new users are stupid and forget will will just reset that
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:32.780]   old dog on password for you so you can get online now write it down in a safe place this
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:38.220]   the because you don't like that.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:45.020]   It's like I'm trying to give you money you idiots and you're making it hard for me to
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:52.060]   do that and now it's it's damn annoying when I'm just trying to buy by music but on the
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.380]   when it comes to like being on the iPhone it means that I can't buy music via the iPhone
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.540]   I can't buy applications via the iPhone when I was when I was flying home from from San
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:03.820]   Francisco after Mac world Expo I thought well here's a great opportunity for me instead of
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:09.740]   me like using this really bad web based flight status thing I'm going to actually buy a flight
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:15.660]   tracker program for the iPhone and do it but it would not let me do it so I mean I'm this
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:21.260]   close to saying you know what I'm never buying anything by any music by iTunes ever again it's
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:26.780]   all going to be Amazon mp3 I know this is a harsh thing to say but I would much rather
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.100]   look like an idiot by saying this than say something that I don't think is true if you're
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.660]   responsible for fixing this and you have the power to fix this at Apple and you haven't you are an
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:42.300]   idiot so what triggers it again so we can avoid this pain well what what triggers it is or is
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.660]   having a mobile me account name that is the same as your dot mac name so I based away I've been using
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.620]   my dot mac account for years to access iTunes now it wants to authenticate via mobile mean and
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.420]   authenticate by both ways but it says that oh wait a minute there's also a there was also a blah blah
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:03.340]   blah at at me dot com there must be some sort of so it's really a mobile me problem I bet
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.900]   well it's it's a it's a problem period like I said I know the Steve is on a leave of absence
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:12.620]   he's not here to tell you that you're an idiot you're you're moron you should not be coming into
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:17.100]   this office with the solution and pretend you are qualified to do whatever job you're doing if I
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:23.020]   had the power to fire you I would do it and hire someone who is competent because it is not acceptable
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:30.060]   that I can't go through hoops to give you money you need to fix this period this this particular
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.620]   portion of the program brought to you by cwob and their inability to get Mac as a sponsor
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:40.380]   brought to you by Amazon mp3 we don't care about authentication we just watch your money
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:47.420]   oh wait a minute oh my goodness safari is playing music for me I'm so sorry
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:53.500]   and that's there was like that's another thing that it does by the way is you get the almost the
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:59.180]   welcome to apple thing when you first start up you know it's interesting that's interesting is
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:05.820]   it's not doesn't seem to be showing on my screen so I had the same thing happen Andy
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:11.420]   in a different kind of way it was extremely frustrating I couldn't log into mobile me
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:17.100]   and I you know because I had a dot Mac account so that's why I'm thinking it is a mobile me
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:22.620]   problem so I had a dot Mac account and and converted to mobile me and then it which is
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.380]   what makes it my password so I would go through the password change and it's and even though I
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.660]   know I changed it properly it was still said you don't know your password so finally I called
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:37.260]   actually no I did the chat thing very nice guy and I said I told him what happened he said
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.540]   well I'll reset the password I said well no that's not going to work I've done it several times he
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:47.180]   says no I have a different way of resetting the password and his way worked now why they don't give
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:52.700]   us the way that works and they only give us the way that doesn't work is beyond me probably security
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.420]   I mean there's probably some kind of much higher level well I was he has root access he has root
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:03.340]   access I guess all right okay it's a little frustrating to me here's the for those watching at home
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:09.260]   here's the this is cool this is the the default tab on safari is now the top sites that you've been
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.660]   to I like it yeah so you can click one and it'll go it'll go right to it
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:20.780]   um hey I think that's a nice feature and then history has this cover flow so I can and by the
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:26.300]   way all my history is still in here so I can actually cover flow through it add previews now
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:31.180]   so it's going to have to download it's going to actually go through oh my god it's going to go
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.180]   through my history and add all the previews of all the sites that are revisited that's going to
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:41.660]   make all those sites happy that's interesting yeah actually kind of cool like as a comics reader
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:48.220]   like I found all my favorite web con oh yeah sure preview them all that I could look at them all
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.540]   on full screen by cover flow that's a good idea and you can just say oh I saw that comic
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:58.620]   let's go to the next one oh that's interesting so I think it's an you know you could overdo the
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:03.020]   cover flow metaphor a little bit but uh I think for history that's kind of handy
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.540]   and they seem to be putting cover flow into everything yeah they have haven't it's in it's in
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:13.660]   you know some version of it's in just about everything like the new i i photos got it and
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:19.260]   i move in i mean it's not exactly cover flow but it has the same feel they bought that didn't they
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.540]   that's not even their own technology it's something they bought yeah it was good purchase so uh the
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:31.900]   good news is you can now get the latest depesh mode record delivered to you automatically
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.780]   automatically i was just wondering how to get the four thousand dollars by this date we will
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:46.620]   deliver the veg mode onto your i-pod we are serious do not mess with us this is i'm not sure why they
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:51.660]   chose depeche mode i didn't even know they were still recording maybe that's why because they said
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:59.740]   yes yeah emi and apple debut the itunes pass and depeche mode is the first band to be available
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.060]   this way i think it's actually probably a pretty good cross section because number one is there
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:09.500]   with emi and number two they probably said yes and number three is they still have the people who are
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:14.220]   into depeche mode at this point are still people who are you know kind of the type that would want
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.820]   to get ahead and want to get the inside you know curve rather than wait a minute you're saying
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:24.380]   people who are into depeche mode of the type who want to be on the leading edge yeah i know i mean i
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:28.860]   i don't i don't i don't mean bleeding edge i mean they want to they want their i want the latest
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:33.500]   at this point oh it's cultish can you guys help me with something real quick yeah who's depeche mode
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:40.460]   oh stop you know who depeche maim you're working your license to hold enough here that you existed
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:47.260]   in the eighties crossby stills in nash jeff rote told oh stop it so real bad shut your blast
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.420]   mouth so here's the deal if it doesn't have a flute in it it's not music according to
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.220]   chocolate
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:36:03.420]   people who sign up for depeche mode's i-tunes past will get the band's new single wrong
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.460]   from their for they probably don't pronounce it that way but wrong from their forthcoming album
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:14.700]   sounds of the universe scheduled for release in april you'll also get the blacklight odyssey
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.860]   dub remix of the new track oh well this is hurting my brain just to listen to this and over the next
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:28.780]   15 weeks you'll get video exclusives before and after the albums release according to emi so i
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:33.820]   guess the deal is you're paying about twice as much as the album it's 1899 but in return you get a
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:40.780]   bunch of crap exactly for twice as much you get twice as much crap well i mean we have to remember
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:48.220]   that nine-inch nails created a you know it's not not a much bigger version of this but they gave
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:55.100]   their album away and then they sold a deluxe version of the album cd stuff signed by the band
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:37:00.540]   for two hundred and fifty dollars isn't that great and made three quarters of a million dollars
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.180]   in a week yeah because people because it's a once again a cult following of a band and they're
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.900]   willing to pay extra to get that and so i i don't think it necessarily is a test they are because
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.220]   i played their songs on garage band there you go there you go but i don't think
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:19.340]   depesh mode is on garage band let me just check my apple mail somebody's asking the chat room does
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:23.660]   safari for really cause problems for apple mail it didn't for me on my other system let me try it on
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:28.620]   this my mail works fine it's where you put it on there yep okay so that was an isolated incident
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:34.540]   from it was actually somebody i respect some some somebody knows about apple i can't remember
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:39.020]   who it was on twitter but that's the problem with twitter you know this stuff goes out so fast
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:44.620]   so yeah you too you know that would have been a logical you too's got a new album coming out
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:48.940]   that would have been a logical band to do this with you know you'd get make money on that they
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.020]   should have been where they should have saved this for the Beatles announcement yeah they might be
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:59.900]   saving it for a while or or maybe they're using depesh mode as look if if depesh mode fans get
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.980]   disappointed that's not a big problem for iTunes but true you want to make sure the system works by
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.300]   the time we put the Beatles on there true well the thing is the question is is that will anyone not
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:13.820]   have the digital versions of the Beatles songs by the time the Beatles release them it's gonna be
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.820]   kind of like where i you know i think i think most people have lost interest because they already
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:25.020]   got them yeah yeah i just recorded all my uh beel CDs into my iTunes that's the way to do it
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:31.660]   uh let's see other stories in the news well let's let's get the kindle uh do you mind doing a little
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:37.580]   mini kindle review sure Andy Anako has his brand new kindle came today the reviewers got theirs
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:43.740]   today actually Steven Levy's writing in Wired magazine he's had his for weeks yeah yeah yeah
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:49.500]   that i do he's probably buying are they going to give Steven Levy a kindle early why would they
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:55.180]   i'm being sarcastic he's only one of the two or three most i'm waiting for Walt Mossberg's review
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:01.980]   you should get it you're an important Chicago Sun Times is no fledgling newspaper great metropolitan
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.540]   newspaper superman would work there if they were able to license it back in 1934 exact
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:12.860]   well first of all you turn it over i'll i'll just say because this is a macho i will say that
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:17.980]   you turn it over and it looks like a sort of like onry the giant version of the first i film
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:28.380]   it's like it's got like some sort of a glandular problem big hands
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:36.380]   my thyroid didn't work properly in your big phone oh yeah you flip it over and it's like all
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.620]   brushed metal they used to be like the kindle one had this really cheap flimsy plastic cover on
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:45.100]   the back with the cover of the battery and the and the uh and the memory card slot that kept
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.180]   falling right off this is all brushed metal at the bottom there are a couple of like little
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:53.820]   perforation perforated openings on the left and the right hand side for the speakers just like
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:59.900]   the iPhone the top is like it's been dipped in dark gray plastics to make it you know radio
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:05.420]   transparent for the for the radios that connected to kindle to the to the whispernet service
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:11.260]   also like the like the iPhone it's completely sealed up so you can't get at the battery you cannot get
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:16.620]   at the memory as far as i can tell but it's a it's a really keen advice the first thing you notice
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.020]   that it has been designed as though it was an actual consumer product this time as opposed to
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:27.180]   a rushed job for whatever design firm can do it a couple of guys who are formerly from frog design
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:34.620]   redesigned it so it's very very smooth very very flush very very uh very very Finland
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:39.500]   Finland Scandinavian design the buttons are not the buttons no longer dominate the left and
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:45.740]   the right sides of the device the kindle one had these huge floppy paddles that had a bad side in
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:50.940]   that you couldn't if you're if you're eating lunch you can't put down the kindle in the middle of
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.220]   reading something pick up a sandwich ticket bite put the sandwich back down pick the kindle back
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:58.060]   back up and expect to be on the same page you were on when you left it because you will just
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:02.860]   accidentally be turning pages left and right these are smaller buttons the downside is that they are
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:08.700]   a little bit harder to find and push i was by fact it took me about 20 or 30 page views before i
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:13.580]   realized that you have to really push that button oh the the the most clicky version spot on the
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:18.220]   page turn buttons are the edges that are closest to the screen and now i'm sort of getting used to it
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:23.500]   uh the screen is about as good as the it's the technical specs say that it's a higher it's a
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:28.060]   much better screen with more shades of gray more readable i don't really notice it being more readable
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:33.340]   the wallpaper photos of famous authors now they are you know more shades of gray that's really about it
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:39.900]   it's limer it's not necessarily more or less comfortable to hold uh the other big change is
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:47.180]   that they've changed the user interface to get around the the slowness of the e-ink display
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:53.980]   the first version had an actual separate fast lcd on the running along the side of the the
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:57.660]   length of the device and you had to basically roll they had a little roller that you would roll
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:02.060]   with your thumb and move an elevator up and down to point at the thing in the menu or the thing in
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:07.580]   the text you actually wanted to click on now it's actually a more standard five button joystick
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:12.780]   and they've added a new twist where what you want to select gets highlighted actually dynamically on
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.860]   the screen i'm not sure if that's better or worse it'll certainly make web browsing a lot nicer i
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:23.020]   have not tried the web browser yet so that's i literally i literally got it we started we started
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:28.940]   the show about an hour ago and i got it about two hours ago so we're still looking at preliminary
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:35.900]   stuff uh i have tried the voice to see the the spoken text feature and it works fairly well like
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:41.980]   i'm saying earlier in the show i don't think it's something where if i had an hour in the car and i
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.900]   got into an interesting part in the book before when i had to leave the leave the restaurant or the
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:50.940]   coffee shop i'm not sure if i would listen to it for an entire hour but it is certainly serviceable i
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:57.580]   think it's more of a like i said more of more of a uh an access sort of feature so that people who
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:02.780]   might have problems reading have vision problems can get access to the now i think it's about 300,000
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:08.380]   400,000 books that are available on the Kindle store and if you already had Kindle 1 you take this
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:13.340]   thing out of the box it has no content on it but you click a link and it will redownload all the
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.980]   books that you've already bought through the Kindle service and so now not only that but the
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:24.620]   whisper sync for as service also works i was on a train home from new york yesterday so i was reading
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:29.660]   rereading the michael palin uh diaries uh that that's one of those books i read like four
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.460]   times over the course of a year because it's so so fun and readable uh and when it redown loaded
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:39.420]   the palin diaries i don't know how it got this information but it actually when i relaunched it
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:45.980]   on the Kindle 2 it picked up almost where i had left off so it wasn't on the exact page i was on
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.940]   because i believe or not i actually had both of the kindles like side by side so i with a certain
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.780]   amount of expectation i flipped on both at the same time to see if they would leave me on the
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:44:00.700]   exact same page not quite but it left me in the same ballpark at least so that's a first look at
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.500]   this percent anyway yeah so i mean it looks like again i've you're talking about someone with a
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:10.380]   massive 63 minutes worth of experience in using this device uh but so far it seems like a really
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.860]   big upgrade seems like you're looking can you hook it up so that we can hear it read uh i was trying
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:19.020]   to find a plug and unfortunately i don't have a really good audio and i guess you could just hold
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:22.540]   up the speakers but it has speakers right i'm not trying that right now the speakers are not
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.860]   terribly powerful but i'm gonna let's see how well this works click click and then we have a new
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.620]   Drobo deal which i'm gonna tell you about in a second too so i'm gonna start text-to-speech
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.580]   hang on
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.780]   "City of waters George Sanders must have got to know in sanders of the river did they have to
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:44.780]   keep stopping for planes landing at London airport in those days tomorrow whales Tuesday
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:50.700]   September 7th have broke bread and sunny as we film in the castle harry h and i have two or three
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:57.180]   scenes together max wall rhymes tonight we all eat together harry h expresses his admiration for
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.380]   loren so libya max his free nut paul well i got a laura salivier right which is kind of interesting
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:07.980]   yeah that's not bad yeah and it is and it's also keeping up with you on the screen why you're
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:13.740]   listening so i mean if if you want if you're learning to read i suppose it's also it's it's
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:18.540]   it's an educational device by one for the kids um but i mean that's good i think that that that's
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:23.420]   better than i thought it would be is probably usable for that for any periodicals it'd be fine
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:26.940]   yeah it's certainly serviceable shut up shut up thank you
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.380]   um but thank you to talking to the painting
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:36.780]   why did you want yes um yeah it's certainly serviceable and i think that anybody who might have
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:41.580]   thought that uh kindle is uh is stealing some of the rights away from the audiobook market
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:46.540]   i think now they're feeling very very good about very very very good about uh about their
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:54.220]   future right now uh but uh i really it's it's it's a good deal i i didn't really realize how big
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:46:01.420]   kindle had become but uh yes i was i was taking the i was taking the l train home
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:06.540]   or rather back to uh my my friend's place saturday night at 2 a.m and i wind up having a
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:10.300]   conversation with just some stranger who works with transit authority next to me who
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.900]   is think about buying a kindle for his kid and one of the whole kindle demonstration i had
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.980]   i had a kindle one with me uh and one of the whole demonstration and asked is it durable and wow
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:22.540]   it actually is very easy to use and uh can i find what i want on the kindle service uh so
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.060]   but i really think that the best endorsement i can give for the kindle is that i got mine a
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:32.060]   couple years ago and yes indeed i did have it in the back pocket of my my tactical pants uh so
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.340]   so that i was actually using it day after day after day and i actually happened to have it in my
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.500]   pocket when i went out this morning to get my my pancake tuesday pancakes and so that's why i
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:43.820]   happened to be there in the diner taking pictures of the brand new kindle too next to the kindle
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:48.380]   one uh so that that's the best thing i can say about the kindle um i do have a preview there's
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:55.420]   gonna be a really full but full bore uh review of the kindle too on uh the sun times uh suntimes.com
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.820]   and the print edition later this week probably on thursday i do have a first look just the first
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:04.940]   impressions that are it's already up on my site uh on an octave.com or cwb.com if you want to check
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:10.140]   it out very cool i you know i think this is an important product i think it's a it's kind of a
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.780]   landmark product i need to complete the this was suggested on the on folks talking on the
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:20.380]   the live uh feed is that i think for a complete review we're gonna really need to see if it blends
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:28.300]   you know i always cringe when they blend things that are of actual value it's like oh when they
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:34.300]   blended the iphone i just it made my butt hurt it's just it's just i just don't want to see that i
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:39.980]   just yeah you also you also have to wonder there are all kinds of i can almost be glib about the
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:45.020]   sort of stuff because oh oh damn now i'm going to have to probably take this with me this brand
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:49.500]   new kindle too that almost nobody else has oh i didn't want to have to carry this all the way to
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:55.500]   the diner oh my oh surely i'm surely none suffer as i suffer on this side of jrusilum
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:48:00.380]   uh and whenever i see someone like i'm gonna be hey guess what we did we took this two thousand
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:05.580]   that's up and and we had we had a go to eat it and then we stopped on it then we put it in a trash
[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:10.140]   compacter and there are all kinds of people out there think you know what i'm using a i'm using a
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:15.980]   penny i'm too computer why are they blending this somebody because that's off and i was lucky to get
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.740]   that i'm lucky that's the only thing i can afford and now someone's destroying this brand oh oh
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:25.500]   hey dang it yeah i kind of with you on that one it just seems kind of wasteful and if it's got to be
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:31.180]   there's got to be easier less expensive less dramatic ways of getting link bait well it's a
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:37.820]   great way to sell blenders yeah turn down i think they're selling a lot of blenders hey speaking of
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:44.860]   blenders the ultimate blender for your data drobo we got a new drobo deal i'm so excited it's
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:49:00.540]   time to buy more yes yes this is actually we know we still have the fifty dollar off the drobo of
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:09.340]   your choice at drobo you know i get all sorts of crap drobo.com/macbreak is the place to go but
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:14.300]   here's the new drobo deal if you want to go for the four terabyte package which you know so you could
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.820]   buy the drobo without drives if you've got drives lying around and one of the great things about the
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:24.060]   drobo i guess i should explain that the drobo is an external usb drive where you can use drobo
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:30.700]   share and make it a network drive that allows you to populate it with four hard drives they can be
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:36.620]   different sizes it adds up the total size of all the drives turns it into a redundant array it's
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:41.660]   not right but a redundant array of those discs so you have a massive single massive drive with
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:47.340]   data redundancy so if one drive fails you pop it out you put in a new drive it rebuilds itself and
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:54.780]   you haven't lost a bit it is it is incredible now the new drobo firewire 800 with usb 2 as well
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:50:00.380]   as firewire 800 is getting great reviews it's twice as fast as the original drobo quieter cooler
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:05.980]   of course you've got the redundancy you can go up to 16 terabytes when drives that bigger around
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:12.460]   right now you know uh you can get a populated drobo a four terabyte drobo for 15 off
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:18.700]   now this is a little different now so for the 50-dollar discount go to drobo.com/macbreak but

[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:39.580]   i actually haven't looked at the deal but i presume this is a better deal than going out and
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:44.060]   buying at new hard drives if you have high drives lying around you know that's that's how
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:48.300]   many of us started using the drobo so it's essentially 150 dollars off that's a great deal

[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:25.340]   what else is new in the makintosh world did i have i missed anything i've been playing with the new
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.700]   saffar do we talk about the fact that steve is not going to be at the shareholders meeting
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:35.420]   he's not they're not gonna it sounds like there's no live audio or video steve's not gonna be there
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:40.700]   toning it down huh he would normally be there as a chairman he would normally be there to
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:47.900]   address the the shareholders normally has been in the past every time since he came back the uh
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:54.220]   uh speaking the the other steve of course it starts in about a week right um on dancing with the stars
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:53:00.940]   now we have an interview i tried you know this is a complicated thing apparently i i sent an email
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:07.340]   to steve's new bride and we all know well and actually i sent a request to steve and i think she
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:14.300]   answered and she said uh this has to go through abc i guess because it's a reality show that
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:19.100]   they're done taping already they don't they want to control i don't know oh they're done taping i
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:23.980]   don't think they can't be done taping they have to have live votes it's a live voting issue what's
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:29.100]   the story Andy i'm almost certain it's just because it's network i mean the publicity the
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:34.860]   publicist for a network tv show like to control eva rethink well we had if you say through her if
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:39.100]   you say something if if if she were to have a conversation with you and then you were to go
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:43.740]   on to go just go on a twit and say oh by the way i understand that he's gonna be wearing a uh
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:48.700]   but he's gonna be wearing a rainbow colored apple logo jumpsuit on his on his on his premiere
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:52.620]   a bunch of people that have been having long conversations with the pr people right then
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:57.260]   how harassed i'm saying i thought you said that you're gonna give us the exclusive on all the first
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:01.420]   stuff that we turn stuff down and then you give each other people so why am i hearing from a direct
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:07.180]   source blah blah blah blah i mean it's there sometimes we make fun of like pr people but the
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.820]   thing is they have a really stressful job because they have to keep a lot of people really happy
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:16.780]   oh and and their clients are only the start of it and journalists and people who are
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:21.100]   journalists like serious journalists can be could give them enough hassle i don't know what those
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.940]   idiots on entertainment tonight what kind of trouble they give her you know well i know i'm
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:30.220]   a pain in the ass if i get stiffed so i can't just imagine so you're you're absolutely right so
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:34.220]   what we did is we went through the publicist we've set up a date i had hoped to get an interview
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:38.380]   for uh get steve on this show or an interview before the show that's not going to happen they
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:43.020]   offered us a uh tape to date tomorrow pre-record tomorrow which i won't be able to do because of
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.300]   the time of conflict we're going to try to talk to steve sometime this week so we'll have
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.620]   uh it'll just be me i'm unless you're you're around Alex i'm gonna pull you in yeah if you're
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:55.740]   around i'll pull you in and uh when is it what what day well we were still working on a time we
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:59.260]   don't know because i can't do it when they offered it they offered it at four thirty tomorrow like
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:05.100]   i'm in the offices on wednesday and friday okay did you did you notice the supreme anti-geek
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:10.380]   diss during the Oscars did you notice they had problems for dance for a cat mall i thought that
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:17.740]   was rude yeah go ahead uh you guys well i i'll see it so i i'm talking about how you know all the
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:22.620]   pretty boys in the cast you know there's a dance this season i'm dancing with the stars made like
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:26.140]   blah blah blah and then he had then he had the the pretty boy oh they didn't show was did they
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:31.260]   well they they did and they all say hey dancing with the stars vote for me this time hi i'm a reality
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:35.500]   team i'm steve and i'm not going to hurt myself this time blah blah blah it's okay so what they're
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:40.220]   gonna have to say what they're gonna have was say and then like the last five seconds uh they're like
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:45.500]   the the tagline for the promo is something like watch what happens next it'll be exciting or something
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:51.260]   like that and so what happens is that they cut to was for the word next saying next and then that's
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:55.740]   all he gets you gets like what third of a second oddly enough saying the name of the company that
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:56:01.660]   steve jobs formed after he got fired by apple you know i i saw that ad and i didn't even see him it
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:07.100]   went by so fast i must have blinked so so it's clearly clearly they are they are not interested
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:12.460]   fellow nerds fellow geeks they're not interested they don't care and keeping us happy so here's the
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:19.020]   thing is that we if we had any compulsion against gaming the system using phone trees using every
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:24.460]   ounce of technology at our disposable to find weaknesses in their voting system and exploit them
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:31.820]   to make steve wasniak the world champion dancing with the stars it is all out war it's on baby i think
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:39.260]   we gotta do it arms if he does not make it into the final two at least we have let ourselves down show
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:47.020]   them show them who they're disin exactly revenge of the nerds part seven we have it we have an
[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:52.220]   announcement according to nylson there are uh... thirty there there are twelve million viewers of
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:58.380]   last night's episode and rassee vjav the seabwaznap received four point eight billion votes
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:03.980]   we are we are looking to see looking into the possibility of tampering well doesn't it doesn't
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:09.820]   it cost something to vote it the cost will be negligible and it's worth it's worth every penny
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:13.260]   it costs something if you don't know what you're doing right right
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:19.740]   if they can trace it i see how it is now we're not calling for a hack
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:24.300]   no no we're just calling for you know if if there's nothing in the rules separate
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:28.220]   habits you from setting up computer that votes electronically 40 times every 10 seconds
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:35.340]   hey what if the country western stars fans do not have access to that kind of technology well
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:39.740]   that's just too darn bad you know you know it does it does sound like it's calling for an
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:45.500]   automated script yeah there's something there there's something calling cells to go in now see
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:51.980]   what i what i thought you were talking about was the dis to edwin catmall who uh when they did the
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:56.620]   technical awards you always feel bad jennifer billes comes out and you always feel bad for
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:02.460]   when this you know you know when when the when the kind of semi-star or the fading star comes out
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.060]   oh this must be the poor person who got stuck with the technical awards last week
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:11.580]   and ensure enough it was jennifer beals i had the pleasure of finding out who the hell
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:15.820]   edwin catmall was last week and i think she said no one knows who he is
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:21.260]   but he's to somebody like you well i mean he's a living legend
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:27.020]   computer graphics is i mean the computer graphics that we that we watch on every movie
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:32.140]   every animated film is based on technology that he worked on that's what she said i mean that means
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:36.460]   everything it's not you know there's there's a handful of people like that you know uh
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:42.140]   catmall is one of them uh you know john knoll of course is another one where everybody's using
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:48.060]   you know photoshop you know and that's part of every pipeline uh and so to uh but yeah do it so
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:53.900]   quickly was just kind of this quick under the rug and he's also the president of pixar
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:58.540]   which helps well yeah but i mean but but but as and he figured out how to do it
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:04.620]   well yeah i mean it the um it's it'd be it's a whole he was it it's whole such a talk about it right
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:09.180]   yeah he was part of the the i i believe he was part of the original pixar i mean the original crew
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:13.980]   that was doing rnd on figuring stuff out that when they and they decided basically they decided
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:19.100]   that they weren't getting any respect at lucas felt not in respect but it wasn't turning out you
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:24.220]   know the big thing for lucas film was miniatures and and uh stomit stuff or not stomit but motion
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:30.700]   control and cgi was not uh which is ironic at this point because you know they don't do anything
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:35.980]   but cgi now but then they sold it to steve jobs i think the number was uh 10 million
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:44.380]   dollars by remember to catmo became the ct o at pixar developed the render man uh rendering
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:48.860]   system used for you know all the movies pretty much everything yep still has such a nice motion
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:56.940]   blur sorry he's won many an academy award but i thought that's the that's the geek disc but
[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:01.020]   you're right well let's double this unfortunately well unfortunately when they do the technical
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:06.460]   awards the best you can hope for is that they don't use it as a spot for comedy because that
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:11.260]   often happens i i am one of those hardcore oscar watchers that could tell you about years when
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:15.500]   they said well you know it's not just about pretty lights and pretty people in glamor
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:20.540]   sometimes it's the unsung little little trolls who make some of this magic possible and we threw
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:24.700]   them a little bit of a bone by taking out a room at the holiday and by the airport and letting them
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:30.540]   have what they like to think is their own the luskers and i decided to be there and see you know
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:34.780]   and it's it's a far cry from some years in which they would actually give them their own like
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:39.500]   minute-long clip package where they're everyone they know it's going to be giving a speech on
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.100]   on television but they at least show them collecting the award and shaking the hand of the person
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.580]   who's handing them the award and that sort of stuff i mean i realize that the oscar's tend to go
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:51.660]   long but who cares it's like super bowl goes long too i don't care i don't care about the
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:57.340]   oscar's going long i just want to see family guy on time well i enjoy i thought it was quite
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:03.500]   enjoyable oscar ceremony also also i think i was only bent by one by one choice what was that uh
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:09.260]   you know what i would have been bent if if if a bender Brad pitted one the best actor right for
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:14.860]   puppetry i would have been a little bad yeah the um the the fact that benbert didn't win sound editing
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:20.940]   yes for walley he carried he carried half a film on sound effects pretty amazing half there was
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:26.620]   a little it was it's some of the best filmmaking in the history of you know in literally in the history
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:31.340]   of filmmaking and some of the best filmmaking ever and it was carried by the sound effects and
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:37.180]   very good now ben has won two two academy awards and a bunch of technical treatments and so on so
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:43.020]   forth it's not like he has been ignored but but it is uh i think some and he was also the voice of
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:51.020]   walley you know i mean he was who's the and uh and uh and he's just uh anyway i was just uh blown away
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:55.580]   that that to me i thought that was kind of a gimme you know given that you you kind of get
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:02:00.140]   that when you carry the film you know but uh anyway that was that was the only one that i was kind of
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:06.460]   left with and the fact that walley wasn't in the in the uh running for best film let's give him our
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:11.500]   awards you can sort of understand walley not being nominated for best for for best picture only
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:16.460]   because every time that you that i feel as though a certain nominee was robbed i have to say okay
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.900]   but it's not so now you're telling you that you're telling me andi that the person that you wanted
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:24.940]   to win we did a better job than this other than you know than uh that shawn pen and milk like oh
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:29.020]   okay no he did do a great job it's just a question of who we've got the most votes okay i understand
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:35.740]   that but sometimes there are times when you have to say if the dark night's very very pedestrian sound
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:41.820]   sound effects editing was deemed to be better than walley in which i can't think of another movie in
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:47.580]   which the sound effects editing was more critical to the development of character that has to be a
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:53.820]   wrong win that is just not correct there is a there is a credibility gap in the giving and the
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:58.620]   awarding of that Oscar to the dark night you think they used to mac dead at any of that
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:04.300]   uh a mac on some of the sound oh i don't know i mean you know maybe just a little
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:10.700]   they get to see any of it because it's bribed out of the company store and get the 10 discount
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.540]   that's why they use mac's a lot i didn't i didn't get to see any of it because the dish network
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:21.900]   doesn't carry a bc in my in seattle man oh man to dispute between the local station and dish oh man
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:26.380]   well i'll tell you i'll tell you what and not i was because i was originally going to be leaving
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:33.100]   new york on sunday but my entire plans were about okay how do i get home in time to watch the Oscars
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:38.380]   or do i legit i do have my sprint uh like wireless modem i do have my sling box at home can i watch
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:44.300]   the Oscars on amtrac and live blog it from the train home i'm on up staying an extra day at least
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:49.340]   partly now there that a good reason to be in town on monday but at least partly it was like i'm glad
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:54.700]   i don't have to make the decision about whether or not i'm going to do this just to watch a tv show
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:04:02.060]   on television so let's give a mac break film award to benbert to benbert for the sound design of
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:10.140]   wallie yes he deserves credit for that absolutely yeah you have an sounder uh probably sounds a
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:15.980]   little like the drobo jingle if i do well you have you have to introduce it properly all of your
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:20.140]   stuff on a drobo that's exactly like the drobo jingle actually well how shall we
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:27.740]   introduce this the loading of a gun the dropping of a pencil the smacking of lips how dry and lonely
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:33.900]   the world of the movies would be without the work of sound effects editors thank you just right
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.900]   christy
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:43.820]   for you know words given freeness tonight show you really could write those award shows and the
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:49.020]   idea you've got it uh again we've already established that the academy is foolish but with this award
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:53.340]   giving with this doubly foolish front hiring us to produce we should be pretty you'll be hosting
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:59.180]   that's it well my command to the nerds to get laws to win i rescind that i want you to put all that
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.220]   effort towards getting leo nominated as next year's host and then and he can write it and i think
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:09.180]   it is a phone voting system so we can do this that there's some excuse for wolverine hosting i
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:15.820]   don't know what it is but there's some excuse and i'm not co yes i'm not sure if they'll be happy like
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:20.220]   with a drobo promo saying i look at all the movies we're able to rip from dvd and spit on to this
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:25.180]   bro so you know what i i want to do something i'm going to give away a drobo right now what
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:31.180]   you can't do that i can do that how can you do that so but it's going to cost somebody okay i
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:38.380]   want somebody to do a mashup with some like oscar footage with like mac break you know like you know
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:46.620]   as the as the sound okay you know what i'm saying yeah take take andy's andy's science theater yeah
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:52.780]   with i once they can take anything they want from any of the mac break episodes the the jingles from
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:58.060]   us or whatever some of the things we say they can put it together whoever does the best job i'm
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:03.260]   giving him a drobo okay i have nothing to do with his contest this is me this is me i'm doing you go
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:07.420]   to you go uh you go uh you're gonna write about this in your blog or something uh yeah go to scott
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:12.460]   born dot com i'll put a post up but look for scott born dot com you just heard it that's the deal that's
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:19.900]   the deal that's all you need to know it's complete and by the way it's 100 percent our opinion as a
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:25.900]   group what we think we don't care what's best we don't care what's best if we just you know get
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:31.180]   a wild hair and pick number three that'll be the one that's the one all right that's very nice of you
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:36.060]   you're very if generous person i think actually we are working we are working we thought it would
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:40.540]   be cool to have somebody do that and that was like an inducement that might make it work yeah i think
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:45.100]   we're working on a drobo promotion of some kind that dane was making noises about that before we
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:50.540]   began he's working on it we're just scared of the the red tape oh i always scared a red tape you know
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:57.020]   me do we care that apple discontinued its 20 inch display the cinnamon display no who wants it who
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:04.940]   wants it not when you can get the 23 at the same price the 20 used to cost 23 24 24 now yeah i got
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:11.820]   my third 24 this week you like those Alex has one upstairs you like it i think the new ones yeah i
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.740]   think they're fantastic oh by the way the the thing the the mystery that i don't think we've
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:21.500]   talked about on the show is how to get your computer your laptop to seamlessly just use the
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:25.980]   mystery of Alex crazy because he would like i'd like close it and go to sleep and then i'd
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:30.300]   now i'd plug the monitor in and and uh and then i closed the laptop and then everything would go
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.820]   to sleep and i was like and then i went through this process of how to do i crack it a little bit
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:39.740]   do whatever well it turns out that all you have to do is simply drag your computer and leave it closed
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:43.900]   and then just plug all the stuff in and the monitor pops up and it wakes up from its sleep and
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:49.180]   it was actually a little too smart for it was too easy yeah it's too easy so that's cool so you
[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:54.940]   don't have to ever open it no you just set it there you just plug the plug the it's fantastic a premium
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:59.500]   over you know a Dell or a lot of other companies 24 inch but you think it's worth the premium yeah
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:03.180]   we got we got a Dell at the office because i was trying i was being cheap at a point in time we we
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:07.820]   got one to see how we whether we liked it or not and uh yeah we won't do that again really i gotta
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:13.420]   tell you the i i did recently i at mac world i struggled with this i took meetings with
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:18.940]   with with our friend the bouffant of knowledge and asked his opinion i asked several people you know
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:23.100]   what he uses a monitor i've always just bought the apple stuff because that's what i always do
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:27.900]   this year i'm going to look around and i literally looked around i went to stores i did everything i
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:33.100]   still ended up right back here because at that price point i didn't find anything i liked as well
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:38.780]   yeah now there was some stuff i found that cost more than i liked yeah all right
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:45.580]   there you go it's a good monitor it's beautiful i mean it looks gorgeous on the desk up there but
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:53.740]   we've wired one into our uh we have a little we've i just expanded my office and we have a little
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:59.500]   repose room now with nice wicker furniture and mirrors and artwork and we put one in there which
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:04.620]   has a feed from the uh that's a funny that's actually the room that the that the other that
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:12.300]   one's in it's in the repose room yes yes Alex reposes there many days oftentimes i like to spend

[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:41.980]   was if he's gonna use a segue or something that'd be awesome anyway we'll we'll interview was later
[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:46.380]   this week we'll have it for mac break weekly on tuesday next week um so you can hear it we're
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:49.820]   gonna do our picks in just a bit unless there's another story anybody the only last one that just
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:55.980]   came in did you see that 25,000 people bought uh iphones uh in sottirabia it's now available in sottirabia
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:10:00.780]   and in one day 25,000 sold which is pretty good for giving the population if it was the same in the
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:04.380]   united states i don't know it'd be some crazy number you know i think the whole the iphone is just
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.020]   such a clear winner in this space uh there's just nothing i keep looking for something to beat it and
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:13.100]   if there's just nothing close it's not perfect we're not saying it's perfect it doesn't tether doesn't
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.140]   have cut and paste doesn't have background doesn't have cut and paste processing doesn't have cut
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:22.460]   and paste and it doesn't have cut and paste not that we're bitty we're bitties and we're bitter we're
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:28.220]   bitter bitties um but i have to say there's just nothing even close to this this really has established
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:33.500]   benchmark for smart phones i'm looking forward to seeing the pre i'm going to give the pre a chance
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:41.180]   but uh you did see that uh this is this is frustrating adobe's done a deal with every other phone to
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:45.740]   put flash on the phone i think we talked about this last week but not on the iphone we got to get
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:50.460]   apple to let flash on the iphone that's going to be a hard one you think i think so right after
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:56.140]   you vote for wasniac immediately call apple and ask for flash on the iphone let's not push the

[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:44.860]   get the mercenary thing out of the way the the the count is it is for your one credit you get
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:50.780]   more than 21 hours on a bridge tech so what a deal so we got a winner in terms of metric tonnage
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:57.740]   it's an interesting it's interesting on two different levels number one it's great to hear
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:03.420]   the life stories of interesting people not only the things that they do but how those
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:08.300]   thoughts came to be and how they were developed you find out you know when we find out about how
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:13.580]   the how the theories of of uh of uh of relatively were developed you find out that he was influenced
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:18.780]   by friends that he hung out with and these two friends he he kind of formed sort of a social
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:22.780]   honors society with and there would be swapping books and swapping articles left and right he
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:27.500]   was influenced a little bit by those articles and he was influenced by the fact that his
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:32.540]   his father was making uh was was making electrical electrical generators and designing electrical
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:37.100]   generators and he was looking at the way that electrical fields get generated when you pass a
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:42.540]   magnet through through through a loop of wire and it doesn't matter whether it's the wire that's the
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.540]   wire that's moving and the magnet was stationary or the magnet was moving and this the coil is
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:51.740]   stationary he noticed he tried that as a kid and also it doesn't matter so that's one of the
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:56.060]   things that let him to think well what if everything that we measure including time is just a matter
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:59.580]   of relativity and it doesn't matter there's no real way to measure it that sort of stuff it's
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:05.420]   interesting stuff that really gets you gets you going is this a narrative about the theory or about
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:09.580]   his life or a little bit of both it's it's a little bit of both because of course you really can't talk
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:15.740]   about you really can't separate the man and his work i mean it's it is he had he had his his his
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:19.740]   his miracle year has he as it's known where he had those four papers that just revolutionized
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:24.220]   everything when he was so you're 28 exactly i mean he was still he was a clerk of the patent office
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:29.260]   and of course they you get the first part of the book before you start to get into that year
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:34.860]   it's mostly set up on here are the situations that led him to have that incredible like mvp year
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:39.740]   and a lot of people when they're trying to get when students are when when you're trying to inspire
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:44.940]   students they say oh well you know Einstein was a mere patent clerk when he and when he developed
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.780]   this stuff and he got failing grades and math and everything and of course you find out that
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:52.860]   well no he he was never failing at any anything he did in school and the only reason why he was
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:58.940]   working at the patent clerk was because a he just couldn't find work in academia for a lot of
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:05.020]   he was a loudmouth because he people he wasn't sufficiently uh i've heard differential to the
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:10.620]   status quo he was uh sometimes it's a good thing sometimes that's a bad thing he was one of the
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:15.020]   uh one of the subtexts of his entire life was the idea that you're supposed to question authority if
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:20.060]   someone tells you that the light turns on because whatever reason you're supposed to not to simply
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.500]   assume that oh it's because the light bulb was generating light you need to take the
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.260]   shade off the lamp and have it proven to you that oh yes that's where the light is coming from but
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:31.900]   not in the German academia of those days they didn't want to hear it well also I mean he baled
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:37.740]   from Germany fairly quickly and yeah left it far behind um but now what makes a sort of interest
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:41.980]   so so you and the uh and the other reason why he took the job of the patent office was because
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:46.940]   uh it allowed him to he as he described it to a friend who was all whom he was also trying to get
[01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.100]   a job at the patent office he said well the great thing is you get about eight hours at work and
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:55.180]   eight hours of just doing whatever you want to do and so I have plenty of free time to work on the
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.420]   stuff that I want to work on plus I get to look at all the research that everyone else is doing
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:03.260]   true it's also talked about because he was a lot of the patents at the time that he was a
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:08.140]   at the Swiss patent office everybody was working on ways of synchronizing clocks everyone had it was
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:12.140]   almost like perpetual motion everyone had a different idea on how to do it and everybody was so he
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:16.220]   kept seeing all these different ideas again not to say that he cribbed anything from anybody
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:21.500]   but you could definitely it's very easy to say oh well he was this this is this was this is an
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:25.420]   interesting little convergence of things that were happening um what what I want to get to though is
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:30.620]   that it's probably a terrible parts of it are a terrible book to be to be listening to in the car
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:35.900]   which is a lot which is mostly where I listen to these books because when you get to the section
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:41.740]   where he's his his miracle year it tries to really explain to you how relativity works
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:47.500]   and you desperate desperately I'm doing 65 miles an hour down i95 and I desperately want to like
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:52.380]   wait play that back again wait play that back again saying but wait a minute if let okay look
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:57.660]   if lightning is striking at two places at the same time it doesn't matter if the person on the
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:01.740]   train thinks that one hit first it doesn't matter if the person on the ground thinks that one hit
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:07.020]   first they hit at the same freaking time you're just making up you're thinking up for yourself
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:12.060]   thinking that it happened at the same time okay maybe you got it wrong but that doesn't mean you
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:17.660]   can build a whole theory on how you got it wrong meanwhile like holy crap bread truck
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:25.420]   so so needless to say there were a whole section of it where I had to say okay I'm going to for the
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:30.460]   next four or five days instead of like watching Letterman while you know while I work or instead
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:34.940]   instead of like watching a uh watching something on the dvr like while I go to sleep I'm going to
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:41.900]   listen to this section of the audiobook while before until it stops getting hard it's over and over
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:49.340]   and over because again I am not a mental titan I can I can I can get it if I get to reread something
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:55.100]   five or six different times and sit and wait wait long enough to realize that oh so that anger
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:58.380]   and frustration that I had about thinking that Einstein was wrong and that this was a totally
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:03.180]   bogus way of thinking about thing he's actually smarter than okay now I got oh there is a reason
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:08.540]   he's considered the greatest scientist of the uh 21st I almost thought I had a good article there
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:13.980]   and I would have gotten really famous for having proven him wrong but oh so does Walter Isaac's
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:18.140]   in the author does it does he do a fairly good job of explaining these very complicated subjects
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:25.020]   uh kind of um it's it's not a brief history of time it's not a brief history of time I think
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:31.580]   that I'm not I'm not even sure I've talked to a lot of people who try to explain how a lot of these
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:38.620]   theories work and I will then repeat this explanation word for word for someone who actually does research
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:44.380]   in this and he said well that is so ungodly simplified right that's it that's almost a mean
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:48.700]   it's the way of describing it so I have to I think I have to again I have to acknowledge my own
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:52.940]   limitations in understanding some of the science that I'm very very lucky that I have a lot of
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.180]   very very smart people looking in my social circle and I can say I have no idea what's going on
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:00.780]   here is there something is there a simple way to understand it and do I or I will parrot back
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:05.100]   here's what I think is going on is that in any way correct and I think that you will run into that
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.260]   same sort of difficulty in certain sections of the book now the whole book isn't about that
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:12.940]   you do find about you know him having affairs that's a lot of fun there's a really messy divorce
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:17.180]   that's always great stuff in the back it was bitter wasn't it yeah oh it was it was tough also
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:23.580]   such interesting terms of the divorce like say okay let's make a deal if you win the Nobel prize
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:27.980]   I get all the cash for the Nobel Prize all right I'll give you some money from the Nobel Prize
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:34.780]   I'm bawling me woman okay but I get to keep all of my records all of the records the jazz records
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:41.580]   the bebop records fun so records I'm not thinking about music and that's me my blue note transcription
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:47.420]   this but I had to get through to get those blue note transition this oh man it is kind of fun to
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:54.700]   see the people behind these very very famous scientists because he let his his life had the same
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:20:01.340]   sort of intellectual arc that a lot of really these big geniuses have where as a kid whatever
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:06.060]   whatever whatever juice has fallen through his brain that let's him think that way let him think
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:11.820]   that way and for a for in a great many ways the other half of his life was essentially not
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:17.260]   coasting on his laurels but realizing that I'm just now that I am the famous Albert Einstein
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:23.260]   I am the person that all the the next generation of brilliant scientists will have to fight against
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:28.540]   to make the next great thing happen and so it's it's not a it doesn't become a sad story but he
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:32.700]   becomes a different type of scientist in that section of the book that's a very good point it
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:37.980]   happens to every I would guess every scientist that he goes from being the usurper to the authority
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:42.300]   and now suddenly he's he's the guy everybody's shooting at one of the very big reasons why he was
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:46.780]   so he was so revolutionary was because everybody was looking for this thing called the ether
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:50.780]   everyone's trying to figure out the nature of how of what light is and everybody assumed that
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:55.020]   just like just like sound traveling through air there was this thing that we there's this thing
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:59.260]   that we haven't found yet called the ether and the and light is a disturbance in this ether and
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:06.060]   every single idea every single major piece of research was centered around either I'm going to
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:09.580]   assume this thing exists and I'm going to do all my research based on that assumption or I'm going
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:14.780]   to do my research to do research proving that this exists Einstein again with that default position
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:19.100]   of I don't believe that exists because no one has shown me any evidence that it exists it doesn't
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:23.020]   make sense to me so I'm going to proceed assuming that it doesn't exist and it's almost it's almost
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:28.860]   as if he's the first person who realized that wait a minute if you take this shiny key like object and
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:35.020]   put it inside that slot and turn it then this big thing in the driveway actually rolls forward
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:39.260]   as everybody else was trying to well if we put a luggage in the back seat that makes it go it
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:44.300]   almost seems unfair it almost seems if you went back in time and said now I've gathered the
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:49.980]   following eight of you in this room to say trust me there is no ether just why don't you take one
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:54.620]   month off and pretend it doesn't exist and see what happens I wonder if those all those people would
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:58.540]   have come up with with relativity on their own but the fact that he was able to say I'm not going to
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:02.060]   buy this I'm going to create I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist and see what happens and everything
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:07.820]   else fell into place anyway as you can hear by my excitement again as someone who like pretends
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:12.780]   to who who likes to think he's smarter than he is the fact that I get so excited about something
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:18.060]   like that it really is a great book again parts of it put boy put on the put on the the hip boots
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.340]   the rubber stuff you can hose down later on because they're parts that you're really going to have
[01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:25.100]   trouble getting through but other than that it really is a terrific biography and again 21
[01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:29.420]   hours stick it to the man you get eight points out of ten of these sticking it to the man scale so
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:39.020]   Walter Isaacson, Einstein his his life and times it's uh it's uh I actually it's on my uh it's on my
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:43.740]   iPod I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet but it is uh as I've already purchased it his life
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:49.020]   in universe I should say um our audible pick of the week sounds really interesting now the point is
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:53.980]   where I want how come it is that Andy can do a better German accent than Tom Cruise in Valkyrie
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:23:02.380]   his teeth are smaller okay audible.com/macbreak go there right now get a free
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:08.700]   credit toward a book and uh could be this book or many of 50 000 plus great titles I love audible
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:14.460]   a real lifesaver I listen to them all the time and I know you will too audible.com/macbreak we thank
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:21.500]   them so much for their support of Mac break weekly and now ladies and gentlemen it's time for our
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:27.660]   Mac break picks of the day mr. Alex Lindsey you're in studio today so I'm going to give you the
[01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:34.300]   pride of place what are you here for us pressure pressure pressure um so uh so my pick of the day
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:39.020]   pick of the week is um a program that I don't you know it's just one of the things I've had
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:44.540]   sitting around and I think I meant to uh recommend it before and I haven't uh haven't been able to
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:49.020]   come back to it I think I skipped it for whatever reason and we use it in the office a lot um it is
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:56.220]   called scope box and um now it's not uh super cheap uh you know it's not it's about it's close to an
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:03.980]   Alex well you know it's my job holding up my end of the economy you know so uh um so scope box is
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:12.540]   made by uh well it's scope box.com to find it and uh and so uh what this does this is for our listeners
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:17.020]   who you know like to do video and there's a couple of different versions the one that we're using of
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:25.260]   course is the scope box HD which is an Alex exactly almost exactly there is scope box scope box SD
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:30.220]   um which is only four hundred dollars and you can download a demo what this allows you to do is
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:35.740]   it seems expensive to get a piece of software that will just show you a bunch of you know little
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:44.460]   graphs um but what these waveforms replace is tens you know five and ten and fifteen thousand
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:49.740]   dollar hardware devices um that you would normally run your video signal through to analyze it and
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:54.860]   to figure it out uh and and to try to sort all those things out when you combine it with something
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:59.340]   uh like a du mon chart you know there's a company called DSC Labs that has one and that's what
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:02.860]   the yesterday I was sitting there looking at cameras through it is really complex chart
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:09.260]   through scope box and um you know it is on from a software point of view it's probably the best
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:14.300]   one out there uh that gives you you know accurate clear results it's easy to move around you can
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:19.100]   capture inside of it if you want uh and so uh from this is you know it's a little bit of a video
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:26.620]   geek uh solution um but it really is also yeah yeah but but this you know Scott's given me a hard
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:31.980]   time but he gave me a hard time when I was talking about HDR too so okay okay he's an HDR guy
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:38.140]   so yeah okay but here's the difference you know on the list of one million things likely to happen
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:45.100]   be getting this thing ain't on that list just so you know so if you're if if you really want to
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:49.740]   get serious uh you know about being able to understand what you're doing we use this we use either this
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:55.820]   or our own software conduit every time we turn on a green screen shoot and we do that pretty often
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:26:01.420]   so it is uh it's really really valuable and um for our production pipe so I thought I would
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:07.420]   include that for my pick right scope box scope box it's a they're gonna bring that server right
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:12.380]   down HD version yeah yeah that one might uh that one might not do so well so uh it's a little
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:16.700]   smaller company and uh and uh the guys work really hard and they do really really great work
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:23.020]   very cool uh and uh free trial for the is it the SD and the HD or I think the free
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:28.300]   the free the free trial is SD and HD uh and then you just decide what you need I mean obviously I
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:32.460]   think most of us need it what does this do this allows you to measure the video signal that's
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:36.460]   going through so this is a technical video signal so but what do you do with that okay
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:41.580]   what do we what do I do look I've got that here see what what I've you know what you're looking
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:46.300]   at that I have no idea what that is what I mean uh yeah what okay so you have a vector scope and
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:51.900]   you have a parade uh a a waveform this is good uh what the waveform is showing you is the different
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:56.540]   luma values and you probably have an RGB parade in there somewhere I don't have a parade if I had
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:27:01.020]   the scope box I'd have a parade right you don't have a parade see if you don't have a parade the
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:05.820]   parade is the most actually for us the most valuable so what it does is this is the week when you look
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:09.740]   at it when you look at an image what typically we do is we look at an image as a histogram right we
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:13.420]   look at it as a histogram we see the black and white on the back of your camera yeah this is a much
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:19.340]   more uh deep view of that information that is the the histogram is a very very basic view this is
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:24.220]   showing you different values across the entire image um that allows you to really understand what
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:29.340]   we use it for for instance we use the waveform to see if the screen the green screen is very flat
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:32.940]   if the lighting is the same so we can look at a scope I don't need to look at the image I don't
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:37.660]   need to have you know I don't need to even look up I can look at the math in the in the waveform and
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:41.500]   tell you whether I have the green screen set to where it needs to be set and if the lights are
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:47.660]   where they need to be and we literally um it takes literally half an hour hour or maybe two hours of
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:51.820]   people fiddling around down to 10 minutes of me turning the monitor around looking at the
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:55.020]   scopes and moving the lights while I'm looking at it you see this in professional studios all the
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:28:01.660]   time the shaders use it anybody who's you know calibrating cameras would use this this is all
[01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:05.500]   very important yeah if if you're trying to if you especially if you're doing like a multi-camera
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.700]   shoot and you want to figure out where all the cameras are and whether they're all in the same
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:15.740]   color space all of this stuff I can't believe I don't have an RGB parade I'm I'm devastated you
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:20.460]   know you can't well the RGB parade is is the the primary reason that we need RGB parades
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:25.580]   when we're shooting is that that tells us the difference between the green record which is going
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:28.940]   to be what we use for the green screen and the red and blue we want that distance to be as far
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.660]   apart as possible and we don't want to clip the green because if we clip it that people have hard
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:38.300]   edges and so so we worry about this all the time when we're you know the vectorscope shows you
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:42.860]   how saturated you well the vet yeah the vectorscope shows you the color and then how saturated so
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:47.740]   the color the color is the orientation of what's there and then the saturation and now when you just
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:52.540]   look at a video it's signal it's not going to help you a lot the what the vectorscope does is when
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:57.500]   you have a test chart in front of it it'll tell you the test chart is calibrated so we have a
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:04.220]   demand we have a we have a demand chart that we use that is like to shoot a $500 chart we have a
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:08.940]   cart piece cardboard that costs us $1,500 that we put in front of the camera and when when we when
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:12.860]   you put that in front of the camera then that vectorscope makes a lot of sense right you know
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:19.260]   doesn't make as much sense until you do that and so but we use but we use all of these and as I
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:25.100]   said they they seem a little geeky when you start and then you don't understand uh you can see as I
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:29.820]   move Leo's looking at I'm looking at one right now I can't show you or I would but you know a lot
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.780]   of times I like to think of it when you when you're looking at it it's kind of like from the matrix
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:37.260]   where you go you know the the visuals are just to help you know the code but after a while you just
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:40.940]   look at the code and you say blonde brunette you know you know it's so you know they tell so you
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:45.100]   can you can once you get used to watching video through a scope you understand you start to
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:49.500]   understand but you can see where in the image you're clipping you can see you know you see that
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:54.220]   that bow there yeah that you're looking at the bow that Leo's looking at looking at the white table
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:59.020]   that's a that means that the the light isn't the same it's not even across it if we were looking at
[01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:02.700]   that in a green screen we know that we have to move our lights around yeah it's like a histogram
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:06.940]   but with a lot more information it's not the overall the histogram only gives you black and
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:12.940]   white information over the you know over the whole image at one time the the the the scope gives you
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:18.780]   a lot more detail within the image to tell you where where things are so scope box would be useful
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:23.420]   really to somebody's pretty serious about their video I mean well a lot of a lot of people who
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:29.420]   use max are pretty serious about their video if you're doing pro or semi-pro work and you're trying
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:34.620]   to find a solution that's going to let you not have to deal with buying or renting these expensive
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:39.820]   scopes right you know and seven hundred bucks is a good deal it is a it's a very good deal you know
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:42.940]   and the other thing it's important is is that it's showing you what's actually coming into your
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:47.340]   computer you can run those scopes on the exterior but the problem is is that's not what the a.j.a. or
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:52.940]   black magic or whatever card you're using is seeing so you really want to get the computer to be
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:57.100]   seeing it and there's lots of you know there's dv rack on you know that that's that that is on
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:03.420]   the pc uh there are other things that are out there but um scope box is the most mac like uh you know
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:07.340]   it's just a very the other thing is just a great interface design so it's not just that it's really
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:13.980]   useful and a useful tool uh but it just you know the the GUI that they put together is is very nice
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:21.420]   there you go scope box Alex's pick every once in a while you know everyone no you know people
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:26.300]   come to love you for that that's what we look forward to from Alex meanwhile on the other end of the

[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:58.540]   to make this a square heart i want to spell this word i want to do a custom shape whatever
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:04.540]   and boom it doesn't it will save it as a psd file if you want to edit it it'll also make it a jpeg
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:11.420]   or a ping file the fact that it works so well uh at least for me in my test on a on a mac machine
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:16.620]   and it's free i i was pretty astounded by this and you know photographers this is kind of a cool
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:21.500]   little thing if you want to you know quickly show 30 or 40 of your pictures in one little image this
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:28.220]   is a cool way to do it they have to be jpegs to drag them in yeah but they can but the result coming

[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:18.540]   actually type a word now my experiments with it you need to have like 60 or 70 images to spell
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:23.100]   a four letter word and make it look right all right all right i'm gonna make a heart okay let's
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:28.940]   let's preview this it's initialized oh look at that it's just oh it's working created the layout
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:35.260]   okay let's do it oh this is good save it as heart that's very cool it's a very fast program
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:41.580]   yeah yeah wow i was i was real impressed and he did a good job and so i felt like you know we we
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:46.620]   talked a little while back that you know we ought to try to find some stuff done by the lesser known
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.020]   developers yes and promote their stuff and so this fits right into that category and you were
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:56.540]   the only guy who actually did that yeah well you know i listened to you you're the boss uh yeah
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:04.620]   i didn't even listen to me so good good good on you for doing that well that's very cool that's
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:09.340]   really and also i also figured tennessy ernie ford probably is a fairly lesser known musical artist
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:15.020]   these days well i remember him didn't he do uh i owe my soul to the company's store
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:22.140]   oh yes and look at that that's i made a heart of pictures of my kids and it's beautiful
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:29.740]   yeah wow that was really fun and that way that was free and fast and you can say if you do it as a
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:34.780]   jpeg or a ping you can real quick send it in an email to somebody to cheer up their day or whatever
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:41.900]   i i actually made one uh from my slideshow i put up my slideshow on vimeo of my recent trip to
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:48.060]   florida my i picked my 30 favorite bird photos from my trip to south with florida i used as an
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:53.660]   opening photo a collage of all 30 photos that i made for the good idea yeah yeah it was great
[01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:58.060]   unfortunately some reason i have all my kids and then there's patrick norton in the middle i don't
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:02.940]   know i don't know how that happened we all sort of secretly thought he was your job yeah there was
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:07.660]   this is a strange thing he's peering out from pictures of my kids into a lot of trade shows
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:15.260]   we know he gets so much better i don't know how that happened all right thank you scott born for a
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:22.860]   great two great recommendations tenice earney ford and shape collage google that i found it right
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:26.780]   away it's the easiest thing to do it was the number one even if you spell it wrong i think yeah
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:34.220]   andy anachico uh i might have to come back to this next week i knew what i was going to be
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:39.900]   recommending i wanted to recommend the bookworm online book library and reader uh that's at bookworm
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:46.940]   dot orily.com but the site seems to be down oh no i can't so i'm sure that i'm sure that it hasn't
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:52.380]   died or anything because it was kind of big news just a few weeks ago um but i don't want to
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:56.940]   recommend something to someone and then but we'll be listening to this what like in a day or two
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:02.540]   yeah you later today um it's a it's a it's part of the orylee labs now
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:07.180]   yeah do you do you're you're getting it Leo no it's it's down can't connect to server
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:16.060]   okay that's weird bookworm dot orylee.com huh huh uh this is something that just uh riley just
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:20.140]   picked up so it might be that in the translation it's not yeah and it was and it was working great
[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:25.660]   i'll i'll talk about it know that at some point in the future he'll be able to be able to type in
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:31.100]   this URL and use it um everyone's still trying to figure out how ebooks are really going to work now
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:36.700]   as it turns out we've been talking about kindle a lot and i think that uh amazon really has the
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:42.300]   way to has the right answer for commercial books but i'm glad that there's but of course
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:46.860]   all these books are protected by drm and you can only read them via the kindle reader there isn't
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:54.220]   even a desktop reader for the kindle uh for the kindle uh drm ebook format so there has been this
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:59.020]   news idea coming out called bookworm in which you have a central site sort of a
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:04.060]   imagine like a centralized iTunes library that has every ebook that you buy and every ebook that
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:08.860]   you've posted yourself and every book that you've created yourself so that no matter what device
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:13.260]   you're on you can go from the laptop that you keep on the nightstand next to your bed and read
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:17.980]   and then wake up go down to your office and then log into bookworm and continue reading from there
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:23.740]   on your desktop machine pick up your iphone and then continue from there for your iphone uh where
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:28.940]   every single book is synchronized because you're all reading them in exactly the same place uh
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:32.860]   that's what bookworm does it has the ad now there are a bunch of different
[01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:38.300]   book standards and services that do sort of that sort of thing but it has the bookworm has two
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:43.980]   big advantages number one it's centralizing on this new standard called ePub, ePUB which i think is
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:49.340]   really the way to go for open source unlocked unprotected digital books book formats there are
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:54.300]   too many formats that will work well in mobile but when you do have the luxury of a larger screen or
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:58.700]   laptop it really falls apart or vice versa just as a format correctly when you're using it on a
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:05.020]   small device ePub is flexible enough and powerful enough that no matter what device you're reading
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:09.980]   it on you almost have an optimal experience on every single device that you use it. Secondly it's
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:15.100]   actually getting a lot of traction now as you as you as you mentioned the fact that O'Reilly is now
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:20.220]   officially hosting bookworm gives you an indication that major publishers are now supporting it as a
[01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:25.260]   format so it's open source so it's not a commercial project it's an open source. Anybody who wants to
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:29.500]   either publish books in this format or create tools that read books or create books in this
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:34.620]   format is perfectly welcome to do so so now O'Reilly for a long time has published books as PDFs
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:38.700]   electronically but you can also buy them as ePubs and you can have them as a file that you can then
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:42.860]   put onto your convert and put on your Kindle put onto whatever you want but it will also simply
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:48.380]   magically appear inside your bookworm library so everything you buy whatever store you're using
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:52.540]   would simply appear in the central library. It will work on stanza on the iPhone too which is
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.460]   exactly stanza actually again because this is open source and anybody who thinks it's a good
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:02.140]   idea to support bookworm or ePub can do so so there's actually just a little little item in
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:07.100]   stanza where you can simply say oh please go make down when you actually purchase the book when
[01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:11.180]   you actually go into bookworm.com you can say gee you know what I want to continue reading this
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:17.580]   on stanza on my iPhone click a button and then the next time you sync via via stanza on the iPhone
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:21.500]   it will simply download you don't you will not have to have a connect to the internet and you'll be
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:26.460]   able to read it right there so it's. So anything saying that will there's a chance that that can
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:31.740]   work on the Kindle then? It does not it doesn't support ePub directly but once again it's an
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:36.620]   unlocked unprotected format so the desktop version of stanza can convert from ePub to Kindle and
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:42.460]   then you can then move it onto the Kindle via via the whisper network so you can just convert it
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:47.660]   to a Kindle book email to your Kindle device and it will open and play and read just fine in your
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:52.700]   Kindle but again the cool the double cool thing is that Amazon there's nothing preventing them
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:58.060]   for putting native ePub support inside the Kindle anybody who wants this can do it it might not
[01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:02.060]   maybe they'll decide they'll it doesn't make business sense but they won't have to come up
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:06.540]   with a deal with anybody in order to do this that's how stanza came across came across.
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:10.300]   I'm looking I'm looking into doing electron publishing a little later this year myself and
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:16.060]   ePub is one of those formats that I'm like every single thing I was worried about looking at PDF
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:20.860]   and looking at HTML and looking at all these different doc formats this is absolutely the
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:25.020]   format that I wanted this is awesome so I'm really quite excited about I've been reading a lot of
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:30.460]   books a lot I mean I've been downloading all be honest I'll be downloading a lot of books by ePub
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:35.420]   I've read a couple of two one or two via that format and again it is really that good
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.100]   of again going right from the website to the iPhone and back again and just being right
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:44.300]   relapsed off. Really good idea and credit to uh her name lies at daily who put this together
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:50.300]   and has a company called Three Press Consulting and she's the one who's put all the energy into
[01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:55.260]   this that's a really great idea. She's a local woman too so I'm hoping to get I'm hoping to talk
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:59.420]   to her again interview and just see where she means to go with this because it really is one of those
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:04.700]   but it really has the form of one of those ideas where five or six or seven years later
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:09.420]   you're talking about this as part of the history of publishing. Yeah yeah it feels a lot like HTML
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:18.940]   1.0. Yeah I agree with you very interesting. All right that is ePubs is the format and we hope
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:25.100]   Bookworm will come back at Bookworm. That's how powerful we are if we crash the server before
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:29.580]   we even mentioned it. Amazing it's it's amazing. We were just thinking it. How do you do that?
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:34.220]   That's how that's how broad our influence is. We can't even think about it. It's like scanners.
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:39.580]   We think about it and its head explodes. I want to talk about something that I could have sworn
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:44.220]   we've mentioned on the show and yet I've done a search and and at no point have we ever talked
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:48.780]   about jungle disc. Have we ever talked about jungle disc on the show? We talked about it but
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:53.180]   I don't know what we picked it. This is this is something you all ought to have frankly.
[01:44:53.180 --> 01:45:00.860]   You know about Amazon's S3 service which is storage in the sky. It is very affordable. You pay
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:07.020]   both for bandwidth used and for storage space but it's so cheap that you'll find you know my bill
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:13.740]   is typically you know a buck 32 cents that kind of thing a month. But yet this is a great way to
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:20.460]   you know kind of supplant in a way I disc and use it for your storage. I jungle disc almost every
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:26.460]   machine now when I set it up I download I have a I have a paid account with a jungle disc which
[01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:32.700]   you and you so you have to have a paid account rather with S3 and a copy of jungle disc which is
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:40.540]   fairly affordable. It's $20 I think and jungle disc will run on the background and upload everything
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:47.020]   to S3. So it's a it's kind of the ideal way to back up stuff very very affordably. Every time I
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:51.820]   create a machine I'll put jungle disc on there I'll say I want you to just keep the documents
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:46:01.500]   folder backed up. You pay 15 cents a gigabyte on S3 and 10 cents per gigabyte uploaded 17 cents
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:07.100]   per gigabyte downloaded and it's I find while that may sound like a lot of money it's very
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:10.940]   affordable. Because it works on Windows Mac and Linux I can put it on all my machines.
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:18.700]   This is the way to do it. Jungle disc runs in the background all the time and and just keeps the
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:23.340]   with the jungle disc monitor keeps it backed up and as it's running whoops and as it's running
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:30.380]   I wonder if that's a oh okay I have to give it a new password. As it's running it will
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:36.380]   trickle up your stuff to the any changes. It has the automatic software built in
[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:43.180]   it's really very very cool. It is frankly the way that I keep my stuff backed up kind of the
[01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:50.300]   last backup of last resort. You can also there's a jungle disc uh Amazon S3 monitor with jungle
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:54.460]   disc so you can actually mount it as a disc drives just like you're paying that much storage per
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:58.940]   month is that 15 cents per gig per month per month. It ends up being very little money I think I have
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:04.620]   40 gigs stored up there. Right. It ends up just being a few bucks a month. The beauty of it is you
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:10.220]   know you can you can make it less you can you can make it more. Jungle disc is a
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:16.940]   great little program. Try it free for 30 days and it's $20 to buy and uh you know I first I think I
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:23.660]   first found out about it um from uh Steve Gibson actually but I've been using it for an awfully
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:28.140]   long time. It's kind of the to me one of the best uses of cloud computing is just pure storage.
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:36.940]   Jungle disc.com and I think they got purchased recently by who bought them. I can't remember
[01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:43.340]   somebody but that doesn't make any difference. It hasn't changed a thing.
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:51.820]   So there so there. Somebody can't remember who who bought who just bought them. Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:57.100]   I'm gonna have to look it up now. Now it's driving me crazy.
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:02.060]   I don't know. Can I walk there from here?
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:07.980]   Ladies and gentlemen I have a couple of uh corrections too during the show.
[01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:15.900]   There is already a published a simple terminal hack to change the tabs from the top of Safari 4
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:22.780]   to the normal spot uh permanently. That didn't take long. I've also found out that the S there
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:29.820]   were problems for uh people who used mail if they used the growl notifier for apple mail. Apparently
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:37.980]   that's the incompatibility. Take that out and uh you're fine um and uh there was another fix posted
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:43.020]   on twitter I think. Anyway people have uh people have responded very quickly. Oh I know what it was.
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:49.580]   One password already has a beta update that will work with Safari 4. So uh feel feel free to update
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:53.580]   to Safari 4. It sounds like all the little initial kinks have been worked out.
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:58.220]   Ah anything else anybody has to say before I wrap this up?
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:03.820]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:13.820]   My heart goes with the wild who snows and I must go with the wild who snows. Wild who's brother
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:22.300]   who switches best a wondering foot or a heart at risk.
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:39.180]   The cabin is warm and the snow is deep and I've got a woman she lies asleep.
