[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, a very special edition right on the heels of the keynote address
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   at the World Wide Developers Conference for 2012. I'm Leo LaPorte joining us at a stellar panel to analyze
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   some very, very big announcements. I'll go left to right here starting with Andy Ennaco,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   the Chicago Sun Times, a regular on Mac Break Weekly. Great to see you once again.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Guten Hello.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Guten Hello.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Andy was great on Twitter yesterday. It's really nice to have you on Twitter.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Yeah, there's actually going to be like the Twitter and Outgo week going to be on
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   yesterday, today and then Wednesday, Tech News today.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Wow, that's great. Well, we like having you on.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It's, it's, it's, it's, I like being on it. Keep you off the streets and off of the bath salts.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Also here from a big nerd ranch, which is back in Georgia, right?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   That's correct.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   That explains the cowboy hat because everybody in Georgia has cowboy hats.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah, Aaron Hillagas is here. He's the author of a couple of really great books on developing in cocoa.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And big nerd ranch is the place to go to learn cocoa programming.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Actually, not just cocoa and iOS. You now do Android as well.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   We do Android. We do iOS and we do cocoa.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah. We also do some web stuff. Ruby on Rails, Python, Django.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   If you were out here, we'd do a program. I really wanted to do a developer show. I really do.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   We should do that. That'd be fun.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   What I want to do, and I think it'd be unique, is teach people the program.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Like do a class, a week at a time class.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   That'd be a hit.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Follow along.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   That's, that will do it.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And we'll figure out a way to work with big nerd ranch.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So on this show, Mike Lambed fame is I was actually at the keynote.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   He was at the keynote, which ended and he left early. How early?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I did a full hour of the keynote and then I got in my car and drove up here at high speeds so that I could actually comment on it.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   That is commitment.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And I know a few things that you do not know because my body was actually there.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   We're going to have the physical representation of the keynote in just a moment.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   But let me introduce to our other panelists to my right.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I very rarely see him anymore. Alex Lindsey is back in town.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It's still happy to be here.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You must have planned it, right? So that you could buy one of these things.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I'm just really happy that I was, these things sorted themselves out so that I could be here.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   We're thrilled to have you. And finally, Chris Breen, who is also with us in our live coverage today from Macworld Magazine, the Mac Daddy,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Mac 9-1-1 column. Hey, Chris, good to have you.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Thank you very much for keeping me on, Liam.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   We need all hands on deck because as far as I'm concerned, this is one of the biggest keynotes we've seen in a long, long time with updates on iOS 6 and the newest OS 10 mountain line.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   As expected, it is a developers conference after all.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   But rarely at a developers conference will Apple announce new hardware.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And they did in fact announce new hardware.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   No Mac Pros, no Mac Minis, no iMacs, no iPhones.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   But two new Macbook Pros and a very exciting retina display Macbook Pro.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   So let's first start with you, Aaron, because I know you were there.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I was there.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And here's what you do not know from the live blogs.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And that is that Tim Cook was doing an incredible Steve Jobs imitation.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I was impressed. We saw a little bit of it in a pirated fee, but I was impressed.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   He was really playing on the heartstrings too.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   He did.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   He talked very slowly. He would pause him when he would become the clumped.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   He would do the namaste hands in front of his mat.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   It was exactly like Steve.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Did the namaste?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Wow.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   He paced it and used the same words.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   He had the black shirt and the blue jeans.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   The shoes were different.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   He's going his own way on the shoe thing.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   But overall, he was working really hard to be almost exactly like Steve Jobs.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   He did not say one more thing.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   That is a trademark.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   He did not say one more thing.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Steve would come back from the grave and sue his ass if he did.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   But he did say, "What do you think?" And I think that's the new tagline.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Instead of one more thing, "What do you think?"
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So, what do you think?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   All right. So in the community of developers, and I guess I'm sort of representing developers,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   we have a verb that the rest of the world does not have, which is Sherlock.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   So Dan Wood had this tool called Watson.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Yes.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And it was very cool because we would go out over the web and it would get you flights and things.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And then it would reformat them.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Right.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And everyone loved it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And so the next time Apple did a version of OS X, they had Sherlock.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Right.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And Dan's business was gone.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   In fact, that was such a blatant case because Watson, Sherlock, you might as well spit in the guys.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So I was sitting there and I was sort of keeping track of everybody who had been Sherlocked in this show.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   That's a long list.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   We saw iCloud sharing.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And if you're Dropbox and you saw iCloud sharing, you'd think, "John, you're a little bit too.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I'm not sure what sharing you'd think."
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Sherlocked with an API.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Totally with an API.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So right now, almost every iOS app, if they want to have shared data, will write to Dropbox.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Because Dropbox is an API, they couldn't write to iCloud previously.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So that really, I think, sold a lot of copies of Dropbox copies or subscriptions to Dropbox because, you know, that was the way to do it.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But now iCloud will have that same capability, basically.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Right.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Right.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So we had Reed Lader added to Safari.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   So the Insta paper people were immediately...
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Marco Arment was in the Twitter and he said a four-letter expletive.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   First, I thought it was about that, to be honest.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   But then he said, "No, this is what AT&T is saying."
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Because they got kind of Sherlock's too, but we'll talk about that.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Oh, the iMessage?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Well, in FaceTime on cellular.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   FaceTime on cellular.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   We had the Growl guys who have been doing notifications on OS X.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   They were solidly Sherlock.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   They have recently gone for profits.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   They're on the App Store.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But I think they saw this coming.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   We've known iOS 6 would have notifications for Sine Time.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Right.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   So notification centers.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   The Google Maps guys, of course, were replaced with the Apple Maps.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   They were solidly Sherlock.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   solidly Sherlock.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I think that might have been the biggest Sherlock ever.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   In fact, the Apple Maps almost featured a feature in Lockstep with the Google Maps.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   We just saw it last week from Google is now all in the Apple Maps, which is kind of amazing.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And then it seems like every entrepreneur I knew is trying to do photo sharing.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Right.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.800]   And so sharing a photo streams sort of Sherlock, all of them in one huge.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.960]   This was also though something that Apple had to do because Mobile Me had galleries and
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.240]   there was a way to share photos using Mobile Me.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.000]   That's going to be turned off at the end of June.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Right.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.320]   So Apple, we kind of knew, would respond in some way.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.520]   What does photo stream sharing mean?
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.920]   It means I could say to you here and here's my photo stream.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   Would you like to see it?
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.920]   How selective is it?
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.560]   No, you can actually select it on a picture by picture basis.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:16.000]   You can say I'm going to share these five photos with Aaron and Andy.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.120]   Can I share them on a website or a gallery that I can then have a public URL?
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   I don't know the answer.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.120]   I haven't said that yet.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120]   Okay.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.120]   That's what Mobile Me could do.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.560]   And one of the big things with that will be convenience.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.800]   Again, you have a lot of people in the Apple environment, which means they're Apple TV and
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.440]   their iPhone and their iPad and they don't have to think about it and they don't have
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.800]   to go to a website and they can just see all those things just kind of feeding into their
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   different devices.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   And it's cash.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.440]   So if you were on the internet and while it's power napping, it's getting that data off
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.440]   the photo stream.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   When you get them on the airplane, you open it up.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.560]   You don't have to pay the $10 for the internet.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.720]   You can see those photos that it downloaded for you overnight.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.720]   I am going to.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.600]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.200]   What we haven't done is kind of giving you a synopsis for those of you.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   I left it right in.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   For some reason.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.760]   Say again, we have Jason.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.440]   Okay.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.840]   We're going to do a complete rundown of everything we heard.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.320]   But actually before we do that, let's say hello to Jason Stell, editor in chief of Mac
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.640]   World Magazine who did a great job live blogging.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.840]   We were watching you carefully, Jason.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   There he is.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   Tight, big typing.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   Yes.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   Highly ill.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   Great to be here.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   So we just heard from Aaron Hillagas.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   We're developers.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   Very excited.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.040]   It seemed like from what we were hearing big ooze and ozz for a lot of features.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.200]   Those guys are really excited about lots of stuff.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.880]   They cheered about the fan being asymmetrical.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   MacBook Pro.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.880]   I mean, they're very excited.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.480]   And also they did the old talk show trick where Tim Cook or Scott Forestall would mention
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.920]   a location like, you know, Korea.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   Yay.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.840]   That's an off cities and countries.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.480]   I know China got a lot of applause.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.400]   I think a lot of Chinese developers were in the audience.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   Definitely.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.200]   Or developers who wanted a piece of the Chinese market were in the audience.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.280]   Could I have something in that?
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.240]   And having Siri and also all of those Chinese web services available is a big deal.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.000]   So what were your highlights?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.600]   Again, you were in the room.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.360]   You have probably a different perspective than those of us who are sitting outside
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   on the curb.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.760]   You know, I think I'm intrigued by what they've done with the MacBook Pro having sort of
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.600]   updating the old one while introducing a new one.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   That's interesting.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.720]   You know, Mount Lion, we'd already seen a little bit of a preview of it before.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.560]   There were only a few new features there.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.240]   And the big story is all the stuff that they're adding to iOS 6.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.680]   And that's the biggest part of Apple's business.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.200]   And so upgrading and enhancing it.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.720]   Presumably iOS 6 will be what runs when new iPhone comes out.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.440]   It'll come out with iOS 6.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.800]   That's usually how they do it in the fall.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.320]   So I think iOS 6 is just huge.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.360]   The fact that they've got better Siri and then bring Siri to the iPad.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.280]   And then they ticked off a lot of boxes of things that just didn't work quite right.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.360]   Like, you know, the fact that Android had a huge lead with turn-by-turn directions built
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.680]   in and they knocked that off.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.280]   And fixing notification center.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.040]   So you can have access to some more stuff there like Twitter and Facebook.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.760]   Making a deal with Facebook, I think is a big deal because they were obviously kind of
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.280]   mad at Facebook last year over the whole ping thing.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.760]   And they've made nice there too.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.960]   So now iOS 6, if I had to pick, although I'm intrigued by this retina MacBook Pro because
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.680]   I suspect that it's the first in a long line of products that are going to have bring retina
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.400]   displays to desktop computers.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.600]   And I think that, you know, this is the beginning of a process that leads to everybody just
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.480]   sort of expecting their desktop display to be high DPI.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:43.240]   Not one word about a new iPhone, but that doesn't surprise me or despise you, right?
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.240]   No.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.360]   And I think it's implied, right?
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.640]   I think existence is sort of implied by the existence of iOS 6.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.960]   That's how that's the trick is they get the developers revved up on iOS 6 now.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.520]   And their apps all get updated and ready for iOS 6.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.320]   And then the flagship product for iOS 6 will be a new iPhone in the fall.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.840]   So it's, you know, it's sort of, you could only see the silhouette of it right now, but
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.560]   I mean, definitely that is going to be the flagship iOS 6 product.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.960]   But there were a couple of things in the silhouette that were interesting.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:15.520]   So for example, the past book is perfect for when they add near filled communications.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.520]   Right.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.800]   Or you'll be able to say, this is my pass for that sort of a purchase or this account.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.960]   Passbook stores, your airline tickets, your movie theater tickets, your loyalty cards
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.880]   like your Starbucks card.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:33.720]   And right now you have to show that passbook page, perhaps as a QR code to a scanner.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.160]   But it wouldn't be great if you could just tap your phone on some reader.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.640]   And it would say, okay, or be in the same just in the in at Starbucks.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.680]   I mean, I buy everything now when I walk into the Apple store with my iPhone without
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.400]   talking to anybody, right, which I still think is every time I do it, I feel like I'm stealing.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.840]   Like someone's going to catch me and I don't feel like I'm stealing, but I just feel like
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.440]   it's like, how does this can't work?
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.440]   I know.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.560]   Square card case is just bizarre.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.200]   It's like, put it on Leo and boom.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   Okay.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.880]   So Jason, were there, do you feel like we're any surprises?
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.360]   I think the surprises are in the details.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.280]   I mean, how they did Google Maps or maps without Google un-Google maps.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.680]   You know, it's all in those little details, right?
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.080]   I mean, they get the big picture, but you don't necessarily see.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.360]   I think that the 3D view was not, it was a little more than we maybe would have anticipated
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.320]   and the way that they do the turn by turn directions.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.840]   It's all, you know, is there a single big surprise?
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.480]   It's hard for Apple to keep surprises.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.800]   I think that there are little bits in iOS six.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.080]   They kept it with, well, I know, up until a few months ago.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.840]   So, you know, with a lot of Apple stuff these days, they can't keep the huge picture a secret,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.760]   but they can dazzle you with the details.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.240]   And that's definitely what they tried to do today.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.840]   Take Tim Cook's performance.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.200]   Well, he was like the MC.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:59.400]   He was like, you know, not even the host of the Oscars, although maybe that.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.800]   I mean, he came in at the beginning and the end.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.080]   He did, he was fine.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.640]   He gave the big picture about what Apple is all about without getting into any of the
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.640]   details.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.080]   And he let those to the individual performers.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.040]   So he did a fine job.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.320]   You know, I think we've all anticipated ever since Steve Jobs took a leave of absence way
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.360]   back when that Tim Cook was not going to be doing the Steve Jobs part.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.880]   It's nice to see him have a role and, you know, be present on stage at the beginning
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.600]   and the end to sort of tie it all together.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.680]   But we figured that Phil Schiller would be out there.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   And it's interesting to see that they've got Craig Federighi and they got Scott Forstahl.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.440]   And they're really trying to, you know, build these guys up as the faces of certain parts
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.520]   of Apple's product line.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.960]   So Tim, you know, Tim was the ringmaster and that's all he really needed to be.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.040]   And you know, this was the first event that Apple's done.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.600]   I don't think you could say this about the new iPad event, which is the last event that
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.440]   you really didn't feel the ghost of Steve Jobs hovering over it.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.040]   And I wasn't in the room.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   Would you agree?
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.560]   Well, there was an icy chill at one.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.680]   No, there was it was it was it was this is the modern Apple keynote approach, which is
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   keynote by committee.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   Yep.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.920]   And, you know, a kickoff from Tim and then you know you're going to see Phil and you're
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.360]   probably going to see Forstahl if there's iOS stuff and Federighi now if you're going
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   to see Mac stuff.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   That's okay.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   They did a pretty good job.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.000]   They were certainly well trained and well rehearsed and there were moments of humor from
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.040]   all of them, which I thought was a really good sign that Erici had a couple of sides
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.120]   that were actually kind of hilarious.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:34.400]   And so I like that too, that a little personality when he when he referred to aim and other
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.800]   legacy messaging systems and everybody tittered and thought that was hilarious and he just
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.440]   shook his head and said, I had to say it, you know, I mean, it's all about I message
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.600]   and he was honest and funny and that was good.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:53.080]   Siri opened the conference, the keynote with a couple of jabs at Android, which is something
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.680]   usually Apple doesn't do.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.040]   That was the last we heard of Google and Android in the keynote, I think, yes.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.520]   No, no.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:07.520]   Forstahl made a point of suggesting that, you know, they've got this huge to uptake on
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.200]   iOS five on their devices and then contrasted that with the percentage, the 7% that are
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   on ice cream sandwich.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   So there was another jab.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   And that's a question.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   That is an apps jab.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   That was satisfaction.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.440]   He said that it was below 50% for Android people and above 75 for Apple people.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.440]   Right.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.800]   Yeah, and he actually had rim Android in Windows on that on that list of customer satisfaction.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.600]   What they didn't do was mention it in maps.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.960]   They just, you know, they did a very Apple thing with the maps, which is we, hey, we
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   have maps.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   We've made our own maps.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.800]   Were there ever maps on iOS before?
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   We don't know.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   But, but now, now there are.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.120]   There was an app.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   I don't really remember.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.120]   I don't remember.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120]   It's on the bus now.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.040]   They didn't say anything like we're killing Google maps and replacing Google maps.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.080]   We've got a better nothing like that.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   It's just maps.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   All right.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.480]   Well, thank you, Jason, for joining us and giving us some sense of what it was like in
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.760]   the room and your update.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.840]   I'm sure you're getting to work at Macworld with a bunch of stories.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.240]   There's a lot to write.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.240]   Absolutely.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.240]   We're going to put Chris Brute into work too.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   And maybe even Andy had not done that.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.240]   Oh, you can steal him if you want.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   I mean, thank you.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.080]   Jason Stell, Editor in Chief.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   With me?
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.080]   Macworld magazine.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   Chris, I think.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.000]   30 files, 2200 words.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   The process gone.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Have you really?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.320]   I had to write as I go because the Sun times wanted something up as soon as possible.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.040]   So you get to see exactly how many typos I made.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.080]   I've already, the great thing about Twitter is that if you misspell Patty LaPone's name,
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.480]   Broadway veterans will say, it's P-A-T-T-I.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.480]   Not why.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   There's no one.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   There's no one.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   I had LaPone.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.200]   We're going to take a break.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.800]   When we come back, we will go through one by one.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.840]   It'll take us two hours.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840]   Everything in the house.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   Slowly.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840]   There was a lot.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840]   There was a jam-packed keynote.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.440]   And I hope somebody took notes.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.280]   We'll do that in just a bit before we do.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.360]   Let me talk about go to meeting the great meeting online meeting service from our friends
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.840]   at Citrix with HD Faces now.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.760]   We're talking in our coverage about Hangouts and FaceTime.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.880]   I don't know if you've ever used HD Faces, but this is, I think, the best-looking video
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.560]   I've ever seen over the internet.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.400]   I don't know how go to meetings doing it, but it's pretty impressive.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.520]   And by the way, it works with the iPad, too.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.360]   So if you want to host a meeting from your Mac or PC, you can, and now people can attend
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.280]   it on their iPhone.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.440]   They can hear the audio.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.360]   And if they're using an iPad, they can only hear the audio speak.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.760]   Watch your screens.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.760]   Watch your video.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.360]   They can send their video using the iPad camera.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.640]   It is really an amazing way to attend a meeting.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.960]   This is completely transformational in the way we work together for collaboration, for
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.960]   training, for sales presentations.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.160]   This is just the best way to go.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.880]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.160]   Visit the website, go to meeting.com.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   The promo code is Macbreak on this.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:57.040]   That's a 30-day free trial, and you're concluding you'll get the HD Faces as well.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.320]   If you want to go to the website and look at the video, you'll really see, but I think
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.560]   you have to try it to realize how good it is.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.200]   We did, in fact, a go to meeting.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.800]   I had six or seven people all on iPads, just as for fun in my office.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.960]   It was amazing.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.680]   It was really incredible.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.120]   Because the iPad, you can hold the iPad, you can show people things.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.640]   It's really, really great.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.840]   The video is crystal clear.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.520]   Anything with a camera and internet access can attend a meeting, can join a meeting,
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.640]   and you can start meetings on your Mac or your PC desktops with go to meeting.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:33.040]   For a 30-day trial, visit go to meeting.com, use the promo code Macbreak.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.160]   We thank them so much for supporting Macbreak weekly.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:45.440]   I guess what I could do, I didn't take notes, but I can go down the list of Engadget articles.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.000]   It will give me one by one.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.560]   By the way, they didn't tell anybody, but they did, if you go to the store, which is
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.600]   now back up, they did announce, or not announce, but they did slip in new Mac Pros, not a new
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.480]   Mac Pros, but with slightly faster processors.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.480]   Which means nothing.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480]   It's not even worth it.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.880]   And no USB 3 either.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880]   No USB 3.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.240]   This is really pretty much saying, and not Ivy Bridge, still Sandy Bridge.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.400]   It's mostly like, yeah, we had a couple extra processors laying around, so here you go.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   Wow.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   I mean, hardly in this.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.760]   This is exactly like when NBC was extending Conan O'Brien's contract one month at a time.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.200]   It's like, we're not going to kill you, but clearly we're just keeping you along until
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.680]   we figure out what we're replacing you with.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.280]   You've got your head on the chopping block.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.600]   The axe is poised, but we haven't actually dropped it yet.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.880]   The 17-inch MacBook Pro did get axed.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.800]   It is no longer in the list of laptops.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.040]   It's gone.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   No 17-incher.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.320]   So you might want to go to the use market.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.480]   They did introduce a new smart case.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.240]   I don't need it.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.760]   I mean, the thing is, is that it's, I mean, this new Mac Pro is so MacBook Pro is so much
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.760]   it's amazing.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   I know.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.800]   I wonder how much longer for the iMac to.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   Apple did introduce a new iPad smart case that covers both sides, $50, and still has
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.600]   that fold up stand in the smart case.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.200]   But here is the list of things they did announce at the...
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.200]   Oh my God.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Can't ready.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.840]   Should I just run through it as fast as I can?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.640]   You start with one topic and then we sort of gnash over that.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.640]   Refreshed.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   They started with laptops, which was kind of interesting.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.000]   Through us all, they said, and now first, new hardware.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.080]   New MacBook Airs with the Ivy Bridge processor and USB 3.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.840]   That's kind of a freebie that comes with Intel's new processor platform.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.160]   New MacBook Pros with Ivy Bridge USB 3.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:41.000]   A next gen MacBook Pro with an amazing 2880x1800 retin display that's double resolution
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.680]   in both axes.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.880]   Also USB 3 and interestingly, HDMI and dual thunderbolt ports.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:58.040]   This is a very high end machine that will have a SSD, 256 gig drive in it, 8 gigs of RAM,
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.000]   the starting price, $21.99, much lower than any of us were predicting.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.120]   It seems like a fairly aggressive price for that.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.440]   Of course, not comparable with a PC or Windows laptop, but still.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.400]   Yeah, but they're not comparable with what they never had.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   They're just packed into this computer.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   I mean, this isn't...
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   I've never seen so much performance packed in the iPad.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   It's amazing.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.240]   It's heavier than the MacBook Air.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.520]   It's almost as thin as the MacBook Air, roughly twice the size of a USB port, one on top of
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.920]   the other.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.840]   This is an incredible device.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.560]   They've got dual fans, dual asymmetric fans.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.760]   The engineering on those is pretty cool.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.400]   We'll talk about that a little bit.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.840]   They've got now a new 720p FaceTime camera built into that.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.200]   A lot of battery, they claim seven hours battery life.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.360]   There's Diablo 3 on it.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.120]   They say it's really good for Diablo 3.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.920]   Obviously, they're doing a lot of that at one infinite loop.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.680]   One of the interesting things is it's all SSD drives now.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.560]   All SSD drives across the laptop.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.120]   They will be updating their Pro Apps Final Cut Pro Photoshop as well.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.240]   They're working with Adobe, Autodesk they're working with as well, and Aperture will all
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   be retina.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.840]   They're going to do an interesting thing, even though they did announce that Mountain
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.400]   Line will be out next month sometime.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.560]   They're going to ship all of these new MacBooks today.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:19.440]   The new MacBook Pro with the Retina display will have updated apps from Apple, a new Safari,
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.240]   a new mail to take advantage of the Retina display.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.800]   The advantage there I think is also that they're not, you're probably wondering why
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.000]   does Photoshop need to be updated for Retina?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.800]   To change the display size.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.920]   So I'm looking at a Retina display and I'm not going to make you wear glasses.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.120]   I'm going to make all those.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   Otherwise, it'll be too fine.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.120]   You wouldn't be able to read it.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.120]   Right.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.680]   Apple's actually been preparing for this for years.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.000]   For developers, every time we installed the developer tools, there was a thing called
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.320]   Quartz Debug where you could change the resolution of your screen and you could test your application
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.080]   to see how it would look if everything was doubled up.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   Interesting.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.880]   We have actually been warned and I would tell all my classes, you should always check your
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.760]   applications on this because the pixels keep getting smaller and the population keeps getting
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.760]   older.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760]   That's it.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.760]   Thank you.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.760]   As an older population, I appreciate that.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.680]   220 pixels per inch, not as high a Retina display, say, as the iPhone, but if a screen
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.480]   is a 15 inches away from you, 220 PPI is pretty darn good.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.040]   They said 26 million copies of Lion had been sold.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:28.200]   There are 66 million Mac users now, four times the number five years ago.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.520]   Mountain Lion, let's talk about Mountain Lion a little bit.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.080]   Some a bunch of new features, of course, the notification center.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.520]   Temptation Siri will be on Mountain Lion as well as on the iPad.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.760]   Well, I think the dictation is a big deal.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.160]   Actually, not full Siri, it'll be iPad style dictation on the Mountain Lion and full Siri
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.960]   on the iPad 3.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   Right.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.840]   But I think the dictation is a big deal.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.400]   I've been using Dragon for 10 years and it's really changes everything when you really
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.200]   start getting used to it.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   Power nap, a new feature that notification center works even when your Mac is asleep,
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.800]   your Powerbook is asleep.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.200]   When you open it up, all the things that happened while you were gone will be popping up on your
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.200]   screen.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.160]   Safari much updated with the new unified search box.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.960]   We knew this was coming and thank God because who liked having that Google separate Google
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   box?
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.360]   Multi-device syncing, it synced your tabs and so forth.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   They briefly, in one line, mentioned a new airport expressed with dual band Wi-Fi, 2.4
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.760]   gigahertz and 5 gigahertz.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.120]   Lion, as I said, next month, $20 to update all your machines and they will offer that
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.440]   $20 update for everybody all the way down to Snow Leopard.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.960]   This is a big push to get everybody to upgrade to Mountain Lion and considering the new features
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:44.200]   in Mountain Lion, including iCloud document syncing, notification center, this Power
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.680]   nap, I think this is a pretty desirable upgrade to 20 bucks.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.080]   Doesn't it seem like Apple is getting users ready for the grand unification?
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.120]   That is, we're starting to see all the features that are showing up on your iPad now showing
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:03.160]   up in OS 10 and the platforms are on the user side looking more and more the same.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:10.480]   iOS, but also the idea of having the Safari desktop synchronize itself across all devices
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.960]   too, the idea of walking away from your desktop machine and then opening up another iOS device
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.480]   and there are all the tabs.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.280]   This is the entire workspace you're working in the Safari before.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.400]   They really are trying to make the experience as seamless as possible.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.560]   Also, when they're really hearing that point home about how they really want to make it
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.640]   plain that the file system is not dead, but they want you to forget.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:37.120]   They want to move it to the shed now back instead of giving it a big room off the first
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.600]   4.8.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.000]   They made a demo after demo saying all your documents are in libraries.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.400]   Stop thinking about folders.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.880]   Start thinking about libraries.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.280]   Libraries are where you keep documents, not folders.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.920]   You understand me?
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.720]   Get off the folders.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.800]   They are iOS 6.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.880]   They talked a little bit about that as well.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.840]   365 million iOS devices have been sold.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.000]   140 million iMessage users.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.600]   They did push iMessage, which will also be on the desktop.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:14.040]   As a unified messaging system, you'll be able to start a thread text messaging on your phone
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.240]   and then take it to the desktop and continue it.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.760]   That will be, I think, much aided.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.200]   It's been around on the beta of iMessage, but didn't work very well.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   I think it'd be much aided by the fact that now FaceTime is going to be integrated into
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.120]   iOS 6 using your cellular phone.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.120]   Your cellular phone number will become part of your FaceTime identifier.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.040]   That might help iMessage work as well.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   Yes.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.280]   Because iMessage sometimes just leaves stuff out and seems to be confused about who you
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.280]   are.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.220]   Although, I'm wondering what that's going to do with people's data plans if they get used
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.120]   to using cellular FaceTime.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   Oh boy.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.560]   And suddenly go, "Whoa, it's in a week."
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.760]   I mean, particularly if you look at the amount of time kids spend texting, so let's say a
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.320]   bunch of them jump to FaceTime instead and say, "Hey, how you doing?"
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.800]   I think in weeks come I hope that your FaceTime on the map as an alternative.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.640]   I'm surprised they got the carriers to agree to this.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.800]   I'm sure that the carriers agree because it's going to use cellular minutes or something.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   Well, it's going to use data.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   Oh, exactly what Chris is talking about.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.200]   I mean, it might be a minute's and data.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.080]   Um, I bet you not.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.080]   I bet you it's just the data.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.080]   I think data would be a lot of it.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.080]   I think if data's enough.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.080]   If they jump your data cap.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.080]   Uh, you know what?
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.920]   Now that they, uh, now that they phased out unlimited data plans across, almost across
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.000]   the board, AT&T still stuck a little bit with it.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.360]   Now that's probably what, what the turning point was.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.040]   I think it might have been why they were all slowly turning them off as Apple saying,
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.040]   "Here's the deal.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   We're only going to do this for a while."
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.040]   Right.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.040]   And then we're going to flip this on.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.040]   You need to do whatever you're going to do.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   Do you think this also indicates an LTE phone is coming up?
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   Ah, interesting.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   Sure.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.120]   Sure would work a lot better with LTE than 3G or Edge.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.640]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   Interesting.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.480]   So, Siri updated to put features back in that were on Siri when it was a third party
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.480]   app.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.760]   Things like OpenTable booking, the ability to launch apps.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.960]   That's huge, I think.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.800]   Rotten Tomatoes reviews, Yelp reviews, sports scores.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.720]   They really made a big deal about the sports scores.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.040]   They must have done a deal with MLB or somebody for all of this.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.560]   It's actually a pain in the neck to try to find those quickly when you're...
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   Is it?
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.640]   Like, I mean, it's not a pain in the neck, but you have to go find you to do a little search.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.840]   And it is nice to just be able to just say, "What's a weird search that Phil showed?
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.840]   Who is taller?
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.840]   LeBron or Kobe?"
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.840]   And it did it.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.520]   Said LeBron is slightly taller.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:32.840]   The really cool undertone is that if Apple's going after Google with replacing maps, they're
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.120]   also really going after Google by replacing Search.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:42.160]   They're really making the point home that Siri doesn't just translate your speech into
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.360]   a web search.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.040]   It tries to understand the sort of information you want.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:51.280]   It tries to get that information from a source that Apple knows can handle that stuff well.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.000]   And then it's going to reformat that information in such a way that's relevant to that kind
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.080]   of information.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.240]   The fact that they are rolling out...
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.280]   They only had a couple different widgets, for lack of a better word.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.200]   When they introduced Siri, there's one for stocks, there's one for weather.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.640]   Now it really does seem as though every time there's a discrete piece of information that
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.600]   people are going to be searching a lot for, they're going to roll out a special Siri widget
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.160]   so that you will see an actual sports scoreboard.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.040]   You will actually see a sort of a baseball card if you're looking for player stats.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.360]   And I think that this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   If you ask...
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:29.360]   If in iOS 6.5, if you ask Siri, I've got onions, I've got a bell pepper, and I've got two pounds
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.840]   of ground hamburger that are about to go bad.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.000]   What can I make with it?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.440]   It will actually give you three recipes and also format them, not just as ASCII text,
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.800]   but as nice formatted recipe cards.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.800]   Pretty cool.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.440]   The thing that most people don't think about, but as developers think a lot about it, is
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.640]   Siri is essentially a server side technology.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.600]   And it's always getting smarter, just like Google Search is always getting smarter.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.760]   And it's kind of hard to push that as like, "Hey, now it's release number 12."
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.640]   But I think they did a nice job by adding in some features like the sports scores so
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.000]   they could say, "Oh, look at how much smarter it's gotten."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.040]   And you can get that feeling like it's making progress.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.200]   I think Google faces the same thing because they want to say, "You know, we've made these
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.640]   incredible improvements on our search, but they have no way to say, "Hey, it's Google
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640]   12."
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.640]   Right.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   It's inch by inch.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   Not big jumps.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.400]   Big global integration of Siri too now.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.320]   In Canada, in fact, many more nations, including China.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.560]   Now given the fact that Siri is server side, it seems to have been suffering, at least
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.080]   early on some server side, troubles, not always responsive.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.400]   I hope that they're able to accommodate a whole lot more users.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.360]   I'm sure you're adding all those users in Asia and it's going to be huge.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.600]   It will not be available, there's new Siri and iOS 6 on the older iPads.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.040]   You'll have to have a new iPad to take advantage of the new Siri features.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.480]   Actually, not only that, but didn't they leave out the first, the whole iPad 1 just
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.280]   for iOS 6 across the board?
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   That's interesting.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.480]   Not that it couldn't handle it because the iPad 2 is a iPad 1.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.200]   Well, maybe it's just a speech.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.360]   I was trying to figure out exactly what it was that was the deal breaker for the iPad
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   1.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.960]   It might have been just the simple idea of all the horsepower that's required for text to
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.280]   speech, all the stuff that's required for Siri.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.120]   If Apple would be willing to simply say, "Oh, I'm sorry, Siri and text to speech should
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.640]   not work on the iPad 1," versus simply saying, "No, let's just have one consistent experience
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.520]   and just leave the first iPad owners on the dust."
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.320]   According to Apple's site, iOS 6 is compatible with, interestingly, the 3GS, the 4 and the
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.320]   4S.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.640]   That's the part that I don't understand.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   Why does it work on the 3GS?
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.480]   It's a good work on the iPad 1.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.480]   I've had one.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.000]   It doesn't seem wrong.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.320]   There's also no camera on the iPad 1, so you miss out on that kind of interactivity that
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.960]   you would get on the 2 and a 3.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.520]   I guess.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.920]   That would really disappoint me because it's the same reason why I'm upset with digital
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.320]   television, which tells you, "Nope, we're either going to give you the most perfectly
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.680]   digital crystal clear picture or we're not going to let you have ABC or NBC or CBS.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.280]   Nope, all or nothing."
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.800]   I would be upset if Apple said, "Well, you know what?
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.080]   It doesn't support Siri and it doesn't have a camera.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:07.320]   We would much rather not let you have anything whatsoever in iOS 6 if we can't give you everything."
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.880]   That's how we're looking out for you, the customer.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.680]   It's really a service site.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.600]   It's really poorly.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.200]   Chris, maybe that just runs really poorly on the iPad 1.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:23.560]   I go back now with iOS 5 on this thing and it's pretty bad.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.840]   The 3GS is an iOS small depending on it.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840]   Isn't the 3GS a much?
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.000]   Yeah, but 3GS runs terribly too.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.040]   I am surprised that they're putting it on there.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.600]   I imagine that it's going to be like people who have the 3Gs and we're running iOS 5
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.480]   or iOS 4 who are going, "This is awful.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.040]   This is a horrible experience.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.120]   We want to go back to the previous version of the iOS and we can't, so we're stuck."
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.120]   We're buying a new phone.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:51.280]   Yeah, I think look for those 3GS complaints when this ships.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:57.720]   Siri will be available only on iPhone 4s and iPad 3rd generation requires internet access.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.040]   The photos, if you go to the iOS 6 page, there's a lot of stuff on here.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.840]   Some features may not be available in all countries or areas.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:10.360]   Flyovers and turn-by-turn navigation only on the 4s and the iPad 2 or later.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:16.520]   FaceTime over cellular network requires iPhone 4 or later, iPad 2 or later with cellular capability.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.520]   That's interesting.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.720]   If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, now you can make FaceTime calls on the 3G.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   That's interesting.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   Over your data.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.800]   I still think that there's somewhere off in the distance, at least somebody at Apple
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.400]   thinking about the fact that they could buy a carrier with cash.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.920]   At some point in time, you just close the circle all the way down.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.560]   They're making so much money for the carriers with this sort of thing.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.880]   I was just saying you just think about what would happen if you were just taking all of
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   that.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.240]   Now, I think Apple would be reticent to do that immediately, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.320]   When you look at them rebuilding all maps from scratch and all the stuff, they have
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.960]   to be looking at all the money that the carriers are taking in on all of the stuff.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.200]   The fact that it still isn't what they want to provide.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.000]   It's not the perfect experience from Apple's perspective.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.800]   You just wonder with that much cash on hand, you really could just go, "We could just buy
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.720]   AT&T, like, write a check and buy it."
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.480]   Not quite AT&T yet, but they're not far.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.440]   Let's talk about maps.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.000]   Maps now has, first of all, Google Maps are no longer built in the operating system.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.640]   They didn't say whether you could still get Google Maps in the app store.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:30.040]   I presume you would be able to, but the operating system will come with a new Apple Maps application,
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:35.480]   which has, according to this, an identical, is that not the identical icon as the Google
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.480]   Maps?
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   Slightly different.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.480]   Only slightly.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.480]   Oh, only slightly.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:46.120]   Now you're taking a right turn or left turn, whereas before you were just there on 280.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.520]   It's still one infinite loop.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.880]   But I think this map wasn't owned by Google, though.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.880]   This is something Apple would have.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   It was an Apple icon.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.200]   It was an Apple using Google Maps, but I don't think that they...
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.680]   Wasn't it like the Google app, though?
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.840]   It is, but Apple made the icon.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.840]   They shipped it with the computer.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   I don't think that it's...
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840]   Okay.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.640]   It looks like the same thing.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.680]   The big difference, of course, is that now, instead of just simply showing you a map point
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.680]   for the Apple campus, it's actually showing you a turn-by-turn direction.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.200]   To be turn-by-turn was like copy and paste.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.080]   Everybody knew it should be there, and Apple really took the time to do a good job.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:25.240]   The way they integrated with Yelp and Siri be able to say, "Now you know where I'm going.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.400]   Where can I get some gas along that route?"
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.560]   That's a huge step over anything else I've made.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.040]   Some interesting things, for instance, a pop-up that says, "Faster root available due
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.400]   to traffic.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.400]   We could reroute you.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   Would you like to?"
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   And you could say, "reroute."
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.160]   These are nice features.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.800]   And then it's crowd-sourced data about the traffic.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.400]   They must be tracking the phones and seeing how your phone is moving through traffic.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.400]   Of course, anonymously.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.880]   Let's also make sure we give credit for credit as due.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.720]   This isn't a fantastic new feature that the Hand of Man has no longer had.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.360]   It hasn't had their hands on before.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:02.200]   Maps and navigation has always been a huge, huge limitation of iOS versus Android, where
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   every Android phone comes with absolutely kick butt navigation, including speech to
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.400]   navigate.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.120]   So I'm looking forward to burning a lot of gas and killing a lot of birds over the next
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.840]   two or three days, trying to figure out exactly how well this works compared to a similar
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.200]   modern Android phone.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.200]   That was a joke.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.880]   Andy will actually not be killing any birds.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.960]   Only incidentally, only with my carbon off-gassing through the very, very old car.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.640]   No animals were hurt in the production of this Mac break weekly.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.960]   But I think for a long time, I think that at this point, just like phones, I mean, like
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.680]   cameras, small cameras are facing extinction.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.280]   I think that this is pretty much the end of GPS.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   Those remote GPS units.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.480]   There's another Sherlock device.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.480]   Yes.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.880]   Especially because they're going to add, just like Google announced on Wednesday, Apple
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:58.000]   also has a small Air Force of Planes flying over major metropolitan areas doing 3D mapping.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.200]   Dogfight, dogfight, dogfight.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.120]   I could just see the Google and Apple planes getting in a little bit of TIFF.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.920]   I hope they're not armed as they fly over.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.680]   It's quite a process to do this.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.120]   Well, now let's ask you, because I think you probably know more about this than most
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.680]   Alex, is it just kind of like Street View where you just fly over with a special camera?
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.880]   Street View is only capturing 2D imagery.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:23.400]   So with Street View, what they're doing is they have, I believe, at six cameras that
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.880]   are basically looking at every different direction.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.800]   And then they've calibrated the cameras.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.960]   The cameras are calibrated together.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.760]   So they know exactly where one should end and the other one begins.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.120]   And then that's seamlessly being stitched from camera to camera.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.360]   And that's a pretty straightforward process.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.600]   Typically, the 3D technology that we're looking at here is what we call photogrammetry.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.280]   And what that is, is that we look at, if you look at an object from two or three different
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.720]   points, and you can identify points on that object that are the same in all three cameras.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.000]   Like I know that this piece of detail, it's usually just the tip of something or some detail.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.560]   But I know that this is there, you know, these match up.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.160]   I then can triangulate where all those cameras are down to millimeters.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.760]   And then I can map all the other points, you know, from that piece.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.520]   And if you get enough points, and again, this one question, how often do you have to fly
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.720]   back and forth?
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.680]   You probably, it's actually probably circular.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.080]   So most likely what you would do is a series of what I would do, if I were doing it, would
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.600]   be a series of circles that move because you're trying to get around every, because there's
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.320]   certain things that are that you really have to do.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.720]   A, you have to get all the buildings from different angles and typically different altitudes.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.120]   And then you also need to know where they cut off and where the other buildings begin.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.560]   And what's important there is the parallax between the, it's actually really important
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.840]   to look at the points, the parallax between the buildings.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.960]   This was stuff that we used to do by hand in the mid 90s.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.240]   And now if you get like that one, two, three, D catch, which I think I recommended a couple
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:50.240]   weeks ago, that gives you a really good example of what they're doing on a server level.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.840]   If you want to see how that works and how well it works, that's, you know, the auto
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.840]   does really well.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.240]   It's very cool.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:04.400]   So that's basically one, two, three D catch is basically a micro version of probably something
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.160]   that's very similar to what these guys are using to format it.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.680]   The way I did it with Sarah Lane on iPad today and all I did was take about, I don't
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.520]   know, 10, 15 pictures going around her.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.600]   And can you catch that over my shoulder?
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.200]   And it gives you kind of a 3D mod.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   This took less than a minute.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.560]   And I remember the free application.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.120]   I remember you doing this with me in the studio.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.480]   You had to put dots on my face.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.400]   You actually were drawing on my face with magic marker.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.160]   And then when you don't come off for days, no.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.160]   And then look, you can get looking.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.360]   So it looks like from her point of view.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.080]   Inside her head.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.240]   This is so this is better than I did.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.000]   In fact, well, this one, two, three, catch is actually the same software that I used on
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.200]   you and years ago.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.400]   This is just a much more refined version of that.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.600]   It's pretty stunning what you can do.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   All right.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.560]   So the ability to see what it would look like flying over city is cool.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.960]   But is it actually used?
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.320]   I think it is because I think the one that's a good question.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.800]   I'm more entertaining yourself in Google Earth for a long time, right?
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   And I think it's been useful there too.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.360]   The more realistic it is, what I find is it's easier for me to orientate myself in a city
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.200]   as to what I'm actually supposed to be looking for.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.200]   Right.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.280]   You know, I'm supposed to be looking for that building or that piece.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:17.560]   And if I'm trying to figure out where I want to go, being able to actually, the more realistic
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.960]   it is, and for people like me, it's really important when we're pre-vising.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.080]   You know, like we're trying to figure out, okay, we're going to put the camera over here
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.760]   or we're going to do some event or we're going to plan something.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.080]   It's much better if I know exactly what it looks like.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.840]   And with Street View, for instance, what's really important, which Apple doesn't have,
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.280]   is the ability to know if it's still there or if it's really there.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.720]   Like you see a Starbucks there, but you don't know if it's really there until you open up
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.720]   Street View and look at it.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.040]   I mean, do you think they'll do Street View and the Apple Maps in version two?
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.040]   I don't know.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.680]   I think that Apple may, you know, because I think that Bing has kind of gone to a 3D modeling
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   approach.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.800]   And I think Apple may do that as well, where it's not a 2D.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.480]   I think 2D is what, I think that was a great start and Google did a great job, and I think
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.680]   they're kind of bound into that.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.240]   But I think the next generation of this is to do more photogrammetry that's more detailed
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.240]   at the street level.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.440]   So some kind of Street View.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.440]   But it's 3D.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.640]   But it's like more of the technology that you're seeing here because this is the next
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.840]   generation when they started Street View doing what they're doing now was not really possible.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   Right.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:21.160]   Well, I certainly hope that they bring this out of cities and into suburbs and rural areas
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.800]   as well because a 3D view of a city may not help me that much because, you know, it's
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   just nothing but large buildings.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.160]   Like, well, is that the large building I'm looking for?
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.720]   Because I can't see down into the cracks of the streets.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:37.360]   But I find in an urban suburban area or I'm in a rural area, oh, yeah, there's that oak
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.320]   tree or there's the guy over there by the hydrant and he's still there.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.520]   And so I can use that to find out where I am.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.480]   So I think in one of the things initially, this is really kind of a widespread sample
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.680]   instead of just, no, here are the major cities and take a look around.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.480]   One of the things I think is important is eventually some kind of API or something that
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.520]   people can actually feed, you know, we're talking about crowdsourcing, but being able
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.240]   to feed some of that data back in.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.840]   One of the great things about Google Sketchup, well, it's not Google Sketchup anymore, just
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.320]   Sketchup was that it was totally integrated with Google Earth.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.240]   And so you could take, you could literally be in Google Earth and say, send this to
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.040]   Sketchup and it would send the 2D representation of that building, the satellite imagery, and
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.720]   then you could build a 3D model of your building.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.520]   So if you're an owner in Harari Zimbabwe or whatever, you could have your building built
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:28.360]   and then reinsert it back into Google Earth.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.160]   And people could choose to turn those on if they're in Google Earth.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.720]   And so it is important because Apple's not going to be able to cover the whole world
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.720]   effectively.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.760]   I mean, this is going to take decades for them to do it themselves.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.120]   There's got to be a way, I think it's really important for them to think about a way that
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:49.600]   municipalities that want their city covered next, you know, for tourism purposes, for
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:57.000]   e-commerce purposes, they might want to invest in their city being covered before Apple
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   might get to it.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.640]   In terms of tourism, I think this Yelp integration is huge because when I'm traveling, I'd much
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.120]   rather stop at a local restaurant with some character than at a chilies.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.320]   And it gives you the ability to really easily say, where can I stop for a decent meal on
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.320]   this next item?
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:17.000]   Chad, we made the same point when they're searching for apartments or a hotel to stay
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   at.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Right.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.920]   And it looks like, I think that's very valuable.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.240]   But there's a big barrier to entry.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   Google's been driving these street view cars around for years.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.240]   Right.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.240]   And they have a lot of them.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:32.920]   Well, I think that Apple in a nod to Google is using unmanned drones, which is working
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.560]   out pretty well, except in Pakistan, it's impossible to map anything.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   People get each other.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.480]   Or they can when you don't know.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.480]   Shop down.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:46.800]   They also announced Facebook, speaking of privacy concerns, Facebook and Twitter, not
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.400]   only in iOS, but also on a mountain lion.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.360]   You'll be able to tweet anywhere anytime.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.960]   And I presume they didn't show it, but Facebook integration would also be there.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.440]   Facebook will be very much part of iOS.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.000]   You'll share a photo to Facebook from the Apple camera or from photos directly.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.200]   You can post your location from maps directly.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.160]   You can brag about your high score from Game Center directly.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.160]   All of this.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.000]   So obviously a little kiss and make up between Facebook and Apple.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.240]   Game Cook kind of promised that at all things D said, "Stay tuned."
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.200]   And well, now we see.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   You can even have Siri post, both to Facebook and Twitter.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.640]   If you want Siri, do a Facebook update and she will.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.280]   And also, poor pig.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.520]   Now you can actually make iTunes store recommendations off through Facebook or get your App Store
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.160]   recommendations and everything.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:40.360]   Yes, you'll be able to like apps in the App Store on Facebook.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.680]   It's smart for Apple to do this.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.680]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.680]   I don't see any reason.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.560]   But it is an advantage because Google cannot and will not do this.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.640]   They won't partner with anybody with Google+.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.360]   And I think that's a big differentiator.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.600]   People want to use Facebook and Twitter.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.200]   And having those signals built in is huge.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   Absolutely.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:05.360]   When contacts update an email address or phone number on Facebook, it'll update it in your
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.280]   contacts.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.520]   These are the kinds of things.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.480]   I think real people really, really want.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.960]   And I had to wonder how much of this was Steve versus Tim.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:22.120]   That when Steve talked about Facebook and Ping, he talked about Facebook's onerous terms,
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.920]   which is not a way to further a business relationship.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:32.440]   And it may be when Tim came back or came on board, he said, "Okay, new day.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.520]   Let's start over and see what we can build."
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.280]   And clearly something has come from him.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:41.360]   Also big app that we had heard rumored, "Passbook."
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.680]   And as you mentioned, this is a very interesting app.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:50.040]   More for what it says about what Apple's planning in the future than what it's doing
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.040]   right now.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.000]   Right now, you put your airplane boarding passes, your movie tickets, your retail coupons, your
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.040]   loyalty cards in your passbook.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:04.040]   And then the QR code or a barcode lets you check in.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:09.120]   But if you add NFC and perhaps add a wallet and credit cards to this, suddenly Apple controls
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.120]   a lot of commerce.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.120]   That's exactly right.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.440]   This is the infrastructure for a major play.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.600]   And again, I don't think you need NFC.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.440]   I think that Apple, just the Apple ID is good enough for payments and pretty much where
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.680]   we want to go.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.160]   I think this is the tip of a disoriented, very big guy.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.360]   Where does an NFC just says, "Here I am."
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:32.280]   Again, you walk into the Apple store, you log on to the Apple network.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:37.160]   It knows who I am because it knows that I'm Alex Lindsey at whatever.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:44.000]   And so I go up to a box, I turn it around and I say, "In my Apple store app and I buy
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.400]   something, I just walk out of the store."
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.000]   I don't even talk to anybody.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.160]   I just literally just buy something to walk out of the store.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.040]   And it knows all of those pieces.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.240]   And I believe that one of the things about the Apple store is I think it's this research
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:00.360]   project for Apple to redefine how people buy stuff at your store.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.680]   Oh, just think of all the data they're getting.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.520]   I mean, oh my God.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   Huge.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.160]   It's always so easy to see where Apple wants to move when you see when you're using an
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.200]   iPhone or an iPad and something is clumsy.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.320]   And the last time that I was on my way home from the airport, I was taking my last leg
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.920]   in the trip home via Amtrak.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.200]   I had to buy my ticket.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:25.600]   I could buy my tickets via the Amtrak app through a credit card and then had to go pick
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.040]   them up manually.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.520]   You just look at, "Oh man, how streamlined would this be if I could just use my Apple
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.840]   ID to authorize the payment?"
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.800]   And then my ticket just simply appears in this app that a kiosk or conductor is set
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   up to be able to recognize.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.720]   So yeah, we're going to see much, much more from this.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.720]   Now, I'd imagine that the merchant has to write some sort of support for the Passbook.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.720]   Well, there's an API, right?
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:48.720]   There's an API.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:55.000]   So if you are targeting, you have an app or your Fandango and you do have an app would
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.440]   be just a natural to say, "Oh, yeah, we'll just store your tickets in your Passbook."
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:05.360]   I think it's very hard for a retailer not to want to do this because as a brick and mortar
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.600]   retail, you're competing against this Amazon.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.840]   The fact that it's really easy for me to go and just do that and you've got to make that
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.320]   buying experience as easy as possible.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:17.360]   And if I know that I can just walk in without a credit card, without having to think about
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.800]   all of those things and just walk in and buy it with my iPhone, I would do that all over
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   the world.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.960]   And I would just not bother to.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.720]   Well, I think of the convenience.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.240]   You drive to SFO.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.340]   It knows you've got a flight today.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.560]   It pops up on your lock screen.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.960]   Here's your tickets, sir.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.120]   I mean, not only that, but your gate has changed or your flight has been delayed by
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.400]   it for 30 minutes.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.560]   Huge.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   So if you're tripped, if you're any of the flight tracking applications, if you're United
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.840]   Airlines, you better work with this.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:48.920]   You better work with this.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.120]   And what does Apple get out of it?
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.440]   Oh my God, the data they get and eventually they've already got your Apple ID and a credit
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.040]   card and some small percentage, of course.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.020]   They're going to have a little vig on the transaction.
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.020]   And this is the beginning.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.220]   This is, of course, the tip of the Ziper.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:05.780]   What if you go to the SFO and every store you walk into when you buy lunch, you just
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:09.580]   use your iPhone and any other little gadget items that you want to get on the car, you
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.580]   use your iPhone.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:14.140]   And you have all these iPhone users that, like me, would never pull my credit card out
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.460]   again if I was able to buy stuff.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.580]   And then you would start picking stores because, oh, it's easy because I can just do it with
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.580]   my iPhone.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.580]   I'm not going to go there.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.580]   I have to pull up my credit card.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.900]   I have to pay it cash.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:27.520]   And then also in terms of customer retention, I mean, once you have all that stuff on your
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.840]   iPhone, you're never going to go to Android, right?
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.840]   Right.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.840]   Right.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.840]   Yep.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.840]   It's called Lock-In.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.800]   And Apple's the best in the world at Lock-In.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.440]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.320]   Great panel talking about the big keynote, two hour keynote.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.200]   Can we talk about it in less than a two hour show?
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.400]   I don't know.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.280]   And the Enochos here from the Chicago Sun, Times from Big Nerd Ranch here in HelloGuess.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.380]   Are you going to-- do you redesign your classes and stuff when you start to see them?
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.180]   I mean, you've got to find out about these API.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.180]   No, new APIs.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.780]   We have good dressing on courses.
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.740]   So we'll go through and figure out-- you know, we have two courses.
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.620]   We have the introductory iOS class and they'll have the advanced.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.340]   And so a lot of these will end up in the advanced class instead.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   Sure.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.060]   Alex Lindsey, also here.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.060]   Have you purchased?
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.060]   No, you're sitting on that.
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.380]   Oh, no, no, I already bought it.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.900]   I'm looking to buy another one.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:17.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:18.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:19.900]   I need a little one.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:20.900]   No.
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:23.840]   So we want to test them because we might have to buy-- we have these remote kits that we
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.840]   do.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.900]   See, I think the fact that they're thin and light and still have this kind of resolution
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:29.900]   and power.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:34.040]   Well, the big thing for us is being able to-- USB 3 means that we can now integrate HD
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:39.640]   cameras into every USB 3 slot as well as having the HDMI outs.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.360]   And the Thunderbolt means that I can hook a bunch of cameras into it.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.640]   We have a lot of remote kits.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.840]   They've got dual Thunderbolt and dual USB 3, too.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   That's pretty hot.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.640]   That's a lot of connectivity.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.200]   Very thin package.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   Also Chris Breen is here from Macworld.com.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.520]   He's the Mac Daddy and a hair of Breen and body of Breen are both on Twitter.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.200]   But he only does one.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   You figure out which one.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.200]   No, I'm just the body.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.720]   Hair has a life of its own.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.720]   Our show today brought to you--
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.720]   Oh, indeed.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.760]   --myerefriends@hover.com.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.000]   The domain registrar you want to use.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Period.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   That's all you have to remember.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Hover.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.920]   People ask me, "Hey, Leo, what's the name of that domain registrar you recommend?"
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.820]   I don't know why it's hard to remember.
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:27.000]   Think of a little hummingbird hovering over your head saying, "Register my domain now."
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.540]   If you go to Macbreak.hover.com, you'll save 10% on your domain registration.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:41.040]   They offer all the big TLDs like .com.net but also .co.ca.org.it.as.us.de.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.500]   Even some of the new ones.pro.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.500]   It is so nice.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:45.500]   I have to say almost--
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.500]   I want a.macpro.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.600]   I don't even consider anything else.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.500]   It's such a nice--
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.300]   Great service, $2.25.
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:58.260]   If you call during regular business hours, money through Friday at 9am to 8pm Eastern,
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.260]   they will not put you on hold.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:01.660]   That's something I can't say the other guy does not do.
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:05.300]   I have lived on hold with the other guy.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:11.140]   And if you use the offer code Macbreak, you're going to get 10% off your new domain.
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:14.300]   If you want to move your domains over, it's really worth doing that.
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.180]   In fact, they don't say this in the ad anymore, but I think it's really true.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.160]   See the top there, 8667316556.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.200]   You can call that and say, "Hey, Leo said you'd help me move my domains over for free."
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.920]   Normally, they charge $25 for that concierge service.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.880]   I think they'll throw that in.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.080]   You can move all your domains over.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.880]   It's $10 to move a domain, but you get an additional year.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.880]   It's a really good deal.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:40.760]   By the way, privacy is built in.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   It's no upsells.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.120]   It's just very straightforward.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:48.160]   Just try to remember this because I understand you're not registering a domain right now.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.980]   I want a Mac Pro.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:52.980]   I know.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.980]   I want a Mac.Pro.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.980]   Update our Mac.Pro.
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:58.540]   Look at all those domains.
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:53:59.540]   Hover.com.
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.020]   Go to Macbreak.com to find out more.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:05.020]   Don't forget to use the promo code Macbreak when you buy a save 10%.
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:07.460]   From the great folks at...
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:10.020]   Hover is definitely the Mac of the administration.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.020]   They are.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.020]   They like to...
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.420]   Yeah, clean, simple user interface focused, support focused.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:16.620]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.080]   It's probably why they advertise on Macbreak because they know you're a quality, quality
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.080]   people.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.080]   It's less expensive.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.080]   Well, a little bit.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   It's really nice.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.800]   We're talking about all thank you, Hover, for supporting Macbreak weekly.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.200]   We're talking about all the new stuff.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.040]   We're not even close to done, you know.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.060]   There's a new feature on the phone.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:38.040]   This is straight from Android.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.040]   Send to voicemail.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.240]   When somebody calls.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:46.000]   This has got to be my favorite collection of life-changing features.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.860]   They finally updated the phone app for people like me who just do never want to be bothered
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:51.860]   by phone calls.
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:52.860]   Oh, call me.
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:53.860]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:56.740]   So if a phone call comes in, you can simply dump in the call.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:00.060]   You can also tap a button and have an automatic response sent out.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:03.980]   You have now have better granularity on who gets access to your ringtone.
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.940]   So you can just simply say, "Look, if the caller is inside my address book, let the call
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:09.940]   go through.
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.340]   If he's not inside my address book, don't bother me."
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:19.840]   Or as they're ringing, you can reply with their message, decline and remind me later.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.160]   And custom messages as well as canned messages.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.200]   And they can even have location-based reminders to call back.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.620]   So remind me in an hour when I leave, when I get home or when I get to work, to call
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.620]   this person back.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:37.120]   That's really good for me because if I don't see someone, I completely move on and I forget
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.120]   the favor calls.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.960]   They are like us, obviously.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:45.640]   Just do not disturb and you can even say, "Hey, do not disturb except for my boss."
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.880]   So you can even make, if they're in my VIP list, for instance, they can disturb me.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.960]   I think that the VIP list is so key.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.040]   It's just because I hate, just in case you're wondering, I hate being called on the phone.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:01.440]   And so it really has to be someone that I need to talk to to want to pick it up.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.200]   So if your kids call, they can get through, but nobody else can.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.760]   You can set up a schedule for do not disturb, so it's automatically every night or whatever.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   You have quiet time.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.760]   I like the reminders.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.600]   And the location-based reminders have always been a nice feature of Siri and reminders,
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.840]   but now it's in the phone app too, which is really rough on the battery.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.400]   Oh, I can only imagine.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.480]   Anytime I do a location-based one, I know that my battery is just going to go toast.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.480]   It's always checking.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.480]   Where am I now?
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.480]   And that's true.
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:28.920]   The power nap feature, I was wondering how much battery life that's going to take if
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:34.560]   your laptop is downloading photos and backing up while it's supposed to be sleeping.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.080]   You're supposed to be sleeping to him?
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.280]   It's not a big nap.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:39.280]   Mail has been improved.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   It does updates too.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.360]   Yes, it does the software update automatically.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:50.120]   And I am a little leery of that because there are certain apps that I want to be updated,
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.960]   and other ones I don't, because maybe- I'm sure you could turn it off.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.800]   To comply with some sort of Apple regulation they've had to pull the feature out and I
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.560]   don't want to update because I want to keep that feature.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:03.560]   I hope that there's an option just to say, "No, don't grab stuff automatically.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.560]   I'll pick it up myself."
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:09.680]   This VIP list is cool too for not just for phone, but for email.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.360]   It's kind of like priority mail on Gmail.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:19.160]   You have a VIP inbox that when messages come from mom or your boss or your kids or whatever,
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.240]   they automatically go to the VIP inbox.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:27.200]   It's easier to add photos and videos to mail messages apparently.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:32.080]   We mentioned Safari huge changes there all over the place.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.640]   I can't even go out there.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   This has been a big, big update on iOS 6.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.440]   It's funny because I thought this was going to be incremental.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.760]   A lot of people say, "Oh, this is going to be a minor update."
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.720]   Aaron, how does this rank with iOS 5 was huge.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.720]   iOS 5 was huge.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.800]   This is in my mind is largely incremental.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:53.640]   A lot of these features that you're talking about are nice, but not earth changing.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.680]   How about this one for accessibility?
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:00.560]   They really focused on the fact that autistic kids have really gotten great results using
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.960]   iPads for communication devices.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:07.000]   Now in the accessibility features, you're going to have guided access where you can say,
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.920]   "Only this part of the screen can they touch."
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.280]   They can't exit this app.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.800]   Not just good for autistic kids, but for all kids, for toddlers.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.840]   The number one thing until my kids got to a certain age, they would constantly hit the
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.080]   home button and drop out of them.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.080]   Because that's the one thing they could see.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.640]   Hit the home button and push it.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.440]   They didn't need to be frustrated.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.120]   Then they would figure out how to hold down and group all your apps randomly all over
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.880]   your iPad.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.560]   I think guided access is going to be nice for everybody who's got kids.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.680]   It was great talk about autism, but it's just anybody with a toddler or employees with
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:41.680]   short attention span.
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.040]   I can do that to my employees.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.800]   That was the one blip.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.720]   Getting outside of the content and talk about presentation.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.600]   That was the one area in any Apple keynote and any memory that I've had where I didn't
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:02.560]   really understand what the product was for, what its main features were or who it's being
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.560]   aimed at.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.880]   It just seemed a little bit scatter-shopped.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:08.120]   Of course, I mean, I wasn't actually present.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:13.560]   That's the first time that even watching something via live blog, I couldn't really grasp.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.680]   It's usually so well honed.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.000]   Every single message they sent that here is what it is, here's why it's important,
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   here's why it's awesome.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   Boom, next.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.640]   That was kind of interesting.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:28.680]   I think the autism references, I think, while they're good, I think they were a little
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.840]   bit of a distraction.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.920]   It's an amazing thing to make that available.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:35.960]   I think that it's been so successful in that community that it's really clear about why
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   they included it.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.880]   I think it also distracted from all the other things that that is going to be available
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   for.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.120]   They touched on it a little bit.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:45.960]   For instance, using iPads for testing.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:50.360]   You can now lock it there so that the students can't go anywhere to check their work.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.040]   That is going to be massive.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:58.120]   When you start looking at stuff like that combined with iBooks, there's this Trojan horse
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:03.200]   that Apple, this kind of building thing where Apple really has the opportunity to reform
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.520]   education.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.040]   The conference was for developers.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:09.760]   When you see that, you think, "Hey, now I can start doing kiosks with iPads," which
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.760]   is very exciting.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.160]   Speak for yourself, Aaron.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:21.640]   Also, you'll catch a point of sale systems is also going to benefit from that.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.800]   It just means one more place, the iPad.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.800]   It's already ubiquitous.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.720]   It's just one more thing you can do with the iPad.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.720]   When you think about kiosks, really think about going to a retail store and going into
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.240]   the, let's say, a big box store and walking up to all those TVs and having little iPads
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.960]   sitting there and being able to go, having a little iBook that tells you about what you
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.800]   should be thinking about when you're buying a TV with cool little videos and 3D and explaining
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.160]   like, "This is what resolution means.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.400]   This is what 1080p means."
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:55.520]   Having that in each section of that store would be really compelling for a lot of these
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.520]   brick and mortar teams.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.240]   What is mountain lion going to save iCloud?
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.680]   iCloud has really been kind of a mishmosh.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.000]   Talk about not really being clear what the message is or who it's for.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.080]   iCloud has really been a little bit of a mishmosh.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.880]   You think, Aaron, that they have a more coherent story now with a mountain lion?
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.240]   I think they're getting there.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240]   I agree.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.880]   When it came out, it was very much of a mess.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.880]   What does it do?
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.880]   What do you get?
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.880]   When you watch the video?
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880]   Graduates.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.200]   They're integrating it in more with the standard apps.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:25.000]   I think it's looking more and more like what they wanted to be.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.560]   You mentioned an API like Dropbox as an API.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.200]   That's going to help on the iOS, I'm sure.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:35.760]   I think what Apple is really pushing you now is these smaller hard drives with the cloud
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.720]   sharing files between all your different devices.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.720]   Whatever you're holding in your lap right now is just a cache of what you work on.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.640]   Whereas, your hard drive is now on the cloud.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.640]   Does that make sense?
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.760]   Because these new laptops, for instance, are all much smaller hard drives because they're
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.760]   in the SSDs.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.760]   They're much smaller.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.200]   But that's going to be okay is what Apple is telling you because that's not your hard drive
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   anymore.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200]   It's just your local cache.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.480]   You said, "Are you going to be able to live with 256 gigabytes?"
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.480]   That's massive, really.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.720]   I mean, so it depends on how well it works.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.200]   This is a big gamble that I think that Apple is taking for the next couple of years.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.520]   Is everybody really ready to trust a system like iCloud?
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:20.440]   And can they really just pull off iCloud so successfully that I won't have to worry
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:25.120]   about having manual oversight on where my files are?
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.560]   That's really the difference for me.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:33.280]   If I put something on Dropbox, I absolutely count on being able to access that file later
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.280]   on.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.440]   Part of it, I think, is just psychological.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.480]   The fact that I can physically save it into a folder or copy it into a folder.
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.200]   I grew up with the idea of files living in folders and living on servers.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:50.400]   But the first time that I think that a presentation has been synced by iCloud, but then my iPad
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.680]   can't find it or can't download it, that's the last time I will ever trust iCloud for
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680]   everything.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680]   Anything.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.760]   One question to me, so a lot of us are watching it because we use a lot at Google Docs.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.120]   And there was like, "Oh, well, finally you can edit files and having them changing."
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.800]   But the one question that I had that I wasn't clear of and maybe I just missed it was whether
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.280]   it's possible for you to share these docs with anyone else.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.560]   It looks like it's a very personal experience.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.720]   You can edit something in pages and then open it up in your iPad and then open it up
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.080]   another computer and you're editing it all at any one place.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.560]   But can you have multiple people?
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.400]   It's called file locking and it is something that you have to solve if you're going to
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.400]   have cloud.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   Right.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.400]   I don't think that they've solved that yet.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   I'm sure they don't do that.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.480]   Although the photo stream sharing is an indication that they're headed in that direction.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480]   It's getting smarter.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.280]   Because that's still the key thing that Google Docs does that no one else does.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.400]   Speaking of sharing, I've been browsing around through the mountain lion pages on Apple's
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.560]   site and they mentioned not only Facebook and Twitter sharing on Mountain Lion but Flickr
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.520]   and Vimeo which I think is really great.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.320]   I'm very happy to see that.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.560]   And there's a little tiny small print that says Facebook integration coming this fall.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:02.880]   So Mountain Lion will come out next month for $20 but the Facebook integration may take
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.880]   a little longer.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.200]   That sounds like they made that deal last night.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.320]   I'm sure there were a lot of details.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.080]   We haven't quite got that in.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.800]   And what will be on iCloud now?
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   It'll be mail.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   It'll be contacts.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   It'll be calendar.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   It'll be messages.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   It'll be FaceTime.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.640]   It'll be Game Center.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   It'll be Safari.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   It'll be reminders.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   It'll be iTunes.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.760]   It'll be the Mac App Store and the notes.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.520]   These will all use your Apple ID.
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:34.640]   That Apple ID gets more and more important all the time.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.480]   And the documents will live in the cloud too.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.800]   As you mentioned, they've shown this before but in Mountain Lion you'll be able to edit
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.080]   on an iPad and pages and the edits will immediately be live on the MacBook.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.080]   Which has been missing.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.680]   That's been sorely missing for the pages and numbers and parts.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.920]   That might be the way they handle that multiple user thing.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.440]   If it makes those changes right away, well, it's saving immediately.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.080]   It is but the...
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.080]   That's the difference.
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   Okay.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.760]   So normally like Dropbox is file oriented.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.440]   So it uses the most recent file and that's that.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.780]   And if there is in Dropbox, if there's a conflict, if you update it and the same
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:14.160]   time as I update it, we both try to save it, they'll make two files and they'll say this
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.520]   is the conflicting file and there's two versions.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.440]   This solves it a little bit because it's more granular.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.680]   It's not file focused.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.280]   It's change focused.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.920]   And so then there's a race condition.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.440]   You change it and I change it.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.920]   Whoever gets their first is going to win.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.560]   If you get there at the same time is the only time there's a...
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.080]   We don't know that.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.080]   We don't know that.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.080]   It could be a file base.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.120]   From that demo that we saw it could be a file base.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.120]   We don't know.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120]   I'm giving it more credit.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.760]   Because like with Google with Google Docs, you can have three people editing the same
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.920]   application at the same time.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.920]   In real time.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.620]   And those changes propagate and there's no conflict.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:44.140]   And you see where everybody else is.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.300]   You can actually see everybody else's cursors.
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:49.300]   So you can see, oh, I shouldn't go into that area because someone else is already working
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.300]   on that.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:51.300]   That's actually Google Wave.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.740]   That's a few remnants left over from the layman.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.740]   It's a really powerful way.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:06:00.900]   If you're in a meeting with three or four people in the same company talking to a client,
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.860]   man on one document and just building all their notes of the meeting, it's pretty good.
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.900]   You're right to be skeptical, Aaron, because I just assumed that that's doing big.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.900]   I'm going to guess it's file base.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.900]   I'd rather it again.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.900]   Yep.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.520]   Because right now, because it's not letting other people edit it, it's assuming that
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.040]   there's only one person editing at the same time.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.280]   So it's updating it, but that's my guess is that right now the way it's built.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.120]   Show it like you're typing and then you're typing, but then you're going somewhere else
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.120]   in typing.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.640]   No, no, they showed at least they didn't do it maybe this time, but they've showed
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.640]   it in the past.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:35.200]   I'm typing on my iPad and they show live updating on the screen on the desktop.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.200]   But with only one argument.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.200]   I have not seen that today.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.200]   He is skeptical.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.200]   And they didn't show it today.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.840]   I've shown them to change an image.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   They didn't show it today.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.780]   They just pushed up the cloud and sucked down.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:48.200]   I don't know if it was a small change or it was the whole file.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:48.600]   Okay.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:54.860]   We talked about I, Sir Elaine has never been happy with iMessages.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.340]   We talked about that in our keynote.
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.900]   Maybe they'll fix iMessages.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.460]   They're certainly making a big deal about it.
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:07.620]   iMessages will now be running on all iOS devices and on all mountain line devices.
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:12.240]   So we could start a message on your phone and then continue the conversation on your
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.240]   desktop.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.540]   And this is just really the continuation of the merger between the two operating systems.
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:16.540]   I like it.
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:20.580]   I mean, if it really worked in the slow drawn out, you could send photos, HD videos, contacts
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.580]   and attachments.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.160]   So although it is going to be a little bit shocking the first time I get that message
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.780]   and my phone vibrates and my computer notification center.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:29.780]   The computer.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.500]   You know, I hit you with Skype.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.700]   You're here with Skype where suddenly everything goes off.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.700]   You know, and you know, and that happened.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:36.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.860]   I think that's why I'm not so smart.
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.780]   Suggesting that it that would be tied to a particular device.
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:47.060]   So if you if you've been texting on your phone and you haven't moved over to the other one
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:51.380]   that they don't only the alert will go off because yeah, I have an office full of this
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:56.020]   stuff and you have seven devices all going.
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:01.220]   So they'll notify you on wherever you have typed last, but you couldn't go I could open
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.540]   a message on the desktop and I'd see all the stuff there and I could start typing there
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:05.980]   and now it's going to notify you there.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.580]   Yeah, I'm not I'm not completely sure where I saw this.
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.380]   I may have been drunk when I imagine this.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:13.860]   Yeah, I think because it's a it's a common problem.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:17.980]   You know, people at Apple have multiple devices in their office and they too have to think
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:21.580]   there's got to be a better way than having six of these things go off at once.
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:22.580]   Well, here here.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:26.580]   I mean, it says right here on the Apple site something new is always popping up somewhere
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:31.380]   on your Mac and email a message of software update a calendar alert notification center
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.620]   makes it easy to stay on top of it all.
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.620]   It's called growl.
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.140]   Yes, the growl people have been saying that for 10 years.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.620]   These Louise simple ordered lists.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.620]   You'll always know what's up.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:47.340]   In fact, it even looks like growl, but you know, I think that not really well the one
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.780]   image here I'll show you the one image I'm looking at dark.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:54.340]   I'd say I mean, I was someone who's developed apps for I mean, our companies developed
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:57.460]   apps for the Mac in the apples is that is that you know that if you're really, really
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.820]   successful, eventually you'll be crushed.
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:00.820]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:01.820]   Sure locks.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:02.820]   Sure locks.
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:08.180]   I mean, you know, I had a great green screen here on Final Cut and now they have a great
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.180]   green screen here.
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:11.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.180]   Oh, really?
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.180]   Oh, interesting.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.180]   Yes.
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:16.180]   You know, was it aimed at you?
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:17.180]   No, it wasn't aimed at me.
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:19.420]   It was just but it's still $30,000 a month of revenue that's no longer there.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:21.220]   That's got to hurt.
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:23.420]   It's got to hurt.
[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.140]   All right.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.500]   They didn't talk about gatekeeper at all, which I'm pretty excited about the nor do
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:32.820]   they talk about the fact that June 1st sandboxing had begun in the app store.
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:34.300]   They didn't want to ruin the good feelings.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.580]   Because they would have gotten a few booze maybe on something like that.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.580]   Guy, five billion dollars.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:42.860]   Hey, remember when you love this?
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.020]   How do you feel about that there?
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.460]   Actually, let's take a break and find out.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.460]   Okay.
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:47.460]   How about that?
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:51.620]   We were talking about the WWDC, the big conference going on right now for developers
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.620]   there in Hillgoss is in town.
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:54.300]   Actually, a lot of developers in town.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.740]   It's fun when WWDC is going on or Mac World Expo is going on because we get a lot of
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:02.660]   Mac folks in studio for Mac Break Weekly and we've got quite a few here today.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:07.940]   So we welcome you all and everybody at home watching the show.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:14.460]   This portion of Mac Break Weekly brought to you by audible.com.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.140]   Audible has always been nicely integrated with the Mac.
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:19.180]   In fact, iTunes just understands audible files and there's no problem.
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.380]   You don't even need a special application.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.900]   Although I got to say the audible app on iOS is awesome.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.060]   Your entire library is there.
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.180]   You can listen to any of the books.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.900]   You can download them onto your device.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:33.460]   It even has some gamification so you can compare your listening hours to your friends, things
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.460]   like that.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:39.940]   Go to audible.com browse around and take a look at all the books over a hundred thousand
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:44.740]   titles available in the best audio bookstore in the world.
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.100]   Father's Day is coming up.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:50.260]   What a great gift that would be for dad is an audio book.
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:54.700]   Unlike the road, Cormac McCarthy's great book about father and son traveling down.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:57.580]   It's kind of a grim but it's really grim.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:02.660]   Depends on whether you like your dad.
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.260]   Treat your favorite storyteller to the performances he'll love.
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:08.500]   They've got a special page.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.540]   Giving dad a gift.
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:11.540]   Not.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.020]   I tell you he is the kid.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.340]   Did dad read to you when you were a little kid?
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.460]   I know I did to my kids.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:22.740]   Now you can treat dad to an audible subscription.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:23.740]   Isn't that a nice idea?
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.940]   I think that would be a great gift.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:27.100]   Or treat yourself.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:34.660]   If you visit audible.com/macbreak you can sign up for audible.com and so many great books
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:39.180]   to choose from in every category.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:46.980]   Fiction, nonfiction history, even self help, sci-fi and fantasy science and technology.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.780]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:50.540]   You can sign up for that gold account.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:55.260]   That's a book a month subscription but the good news is the first month's free.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.580]   First book is free.
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:02.460]   Yours to keep and you can cancel at any time pay nothing but still get that book which is
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:03.460]   good.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:06.700]   The new movie Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter is coming soon.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:11.220]   You want to read the book before you see the movie because there's spoilers.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.020]   I don't know.
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:17.900]   They're probably really it's probably nothing in there that you couldn't guess.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.860]   True blood came back this week.
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.380]   Watch the last night on HBO.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.380]   Have you read the Suki Stackhouse novels?
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.180]   There's a bunch of them.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.980]   It's a great series and if you love true blood you'll love.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:34.180]   Suki start with the first dead until dark.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.380]   Suki Stackhouse southern vampire.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.260]   I'll tell you audible is a great place.
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:41.260]   It's fun just to browse around when people get together.
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:44.460]   Audible fans get together with one of the things we really love to do is say, "Hey, what
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.460]   are you reading?
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.460]   What's new?"
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.460]   Paul Wheaton has a new novel.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.980]   He's reading a new novel from John Scalzi.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.020]   Red shirts, a novel with three coders.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.780]   What do you listen to Andy?
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.220]   Oh boy, I just heard about this yesterday.
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:06.580]   Just bought it and it's all I can do not to do nothing but listen to this.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:15.020]   Imagine an audiobook for a staged reading of the odd couple with Dan Castelleda and Nathan
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.340]   Lane as Felix and Oscar.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.340]   That sounds often.
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:19.340]   Awesome.
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:21.820]   Dan is a voice from the Simpsons of course.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:22.820]   Exactly.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:29.340]   Imagine that it's not just that one play but ten Neil Simon plays in staged readings by
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:37.820]   professional name-brand actors like Richard Dreyfus, Eric Stoltz, Laura Linney.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:40.220]   Someone else was recommending a list of really cool audiobooks.
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:46.540]   It's called the Neil Simon collection and it's all been produced by LA TheatreWorks.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.140]   So it's ten Neil Simon plays.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:54.780]   I've only listened to the first 20 minutes of the odd couple and it became one of those
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.980]   moments where, "Okay, this was definitely a good purchase.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:04.020]   We're going to put this aside because we have a lot of things to write between now and then."
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.020]   Oh boy.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.020]   I can't wait to get this with.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.420]   17 hours of Neil Simon plays.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:13.940]   Also, if you're going to have one playwright that you want to, that's perfectly okay to
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:17.020]   hear him just as audio, not as staged plays.
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:22.420]   Neil Simon, he is the master of dialogue, the master of pattern and it's like, "Oh man,
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:23.500]   it's just absolutely perfect."
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:28.140]   So yeah, this is one of those moments where even if I weren't on subscription, I feel
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:33.940]   as though if I didn't have credits left, I'd be like, "I'm going to spend $25 in buy.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:34.940]   I've got to have it."
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.300]   I'm adding that to my wish list because that's going to be on my next...
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.860]   Yeah, that's my next purchase.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:44.540]   I noticed they do the same thing with George Bernard Shaw, Noel Coward and Oscar Wilde.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.820]   So Audible, there you go.
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.980]   It's more than just books.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:47.980]   It's theater too.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:48.980]   Really?
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:49.980]   It's great.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:52.780]   Only a ton of you phone.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:56.700]   I got to tell you, if you're not an Audible member, please go to audible.com/macbreak and
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:57.700]   sign up today.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:02.180]   If you've got a flight coming up, if you've got a commute, if you just walk the dog or
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:07.060]   do the treadmill, you can read and those times normally you'd just be down times.
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:09.860]   You know, you'd be walking along on the treadmill.
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:16.940]   Now you can be reading great literature or listening to greatplaceaudible.com/macbreak.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:17.940]   Yes.
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.940]   Yes, Aaron Hill, I guess.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.300]   I see that you have gone.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.300]   I am preparing.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:24.300]   I'm preparing.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.300]   Red Sweater.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:29.500]   Yes, Daniel Daukett has a great little company called Red Sweater and has a blog and he's
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.980]   been dealing with the sandboxing a great deal.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:36.220]   He does Mars Edit, which is a fantastic blog editing tool that I use.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.020]   And he's just a great, great guy.
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:43.220]   He also has a very nice little Apple Script tool that puts Apple Scripts in your menu bar
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:44.220]   that I really like.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.980]   He sells that on the App Store.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:49.500]   So he's aware of the issues of App Store versus selling direct.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:50.500]   Right.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.500]   What does he say?
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.620]   So we actually just found sandbox one of our apps.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:58.300]   We have a tool called eClicker, which is a student response system where you can put up
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.900]   a question and let users choose an answer and you can see the result.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:02.900]   I've used it.
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:03.900]   It's great.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:04.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:05.900]   Thanks.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:10.900]   So it's a great collaboration for the change in the Mac App Store and it was fine.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.200]   And overall, that's sort of what most of the developer community thinks is that sandboxing
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:20.940]   is a good idea because it gives users a very clear idea of what they're approving their
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:21.940]   app to do.
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:23.740]   And that's something you really want, right?
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:27.740]   The worst thing you can do is what ended up with Microsoft where they were self extracting
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:28.980]   .exe files, right?
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:34.100]   You train your users to double click on an application to run it to install something.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:38.740]   So the gatekeeper idea of being able to say, "I'm installing this app.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.500]   It wants to be able to talk to the network and the file system.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500]   Okay, I'm fine with that."
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.500]   That's a gamekeeper related.
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.500]   That's a gamekeeper.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.500]   What about sandboxing?
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.500]   What about sandboxing?
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:48.500]   That's a gamekeeper.
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.500]   What about sandboxing?
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.500]   What about sandboxing?
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   That's what you do at your end as a developer.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:52.500]   That's what you say.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:57.860]   I am signing this application and I am saying that it only wants these entitlements.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.700]   And the gatekeeper is the interface to that.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.580]   When the user can say, "Okay, that app to do these entitlements."
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:09.620]   And starting in Mountain Lion, you will as a user have three checkboxes in security.
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:13.460]   You can say, "I will only be allowed to buy stuff in the App Store.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:19.420]   I will only be allowed to buy apps with certs that have done what you just described, which
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.740]   is say, "I'm going to do this, this, and this."
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.380]   And that's all.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.700]   And then third, just wide open apps, right?
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.700]   Is that right?
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.740]   Because I believe that now it has to be sandboxed to be in the App Store.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:32.740]   So that would only be two checkboxes.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:41.460]   No, well, I think there is a middle ground where it's not in the App Store, but they
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:44.460]   have agreed to apply and find it.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.460]   Oh, they designed it.
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.460]   Yeah.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.460]   What makes it relevant?
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:49.460]   In other words, you could do more.
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:53.340]   If you're selling the App Store, there are things you just cannot do.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.580]   Like you can't have a demo version.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:58.540]   So if you wanted to do that, you would sell it on your website.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:03.220]   But if you wanted a cert security to your users, you'd say, "But it is cert-- it does
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.220]   have a certificate.
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:05.940]   It is sandboxed."
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.300]   The things that most developers are concerned about is that the entitlements are not fine
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:13.740]   grand enough where you can say, "I just need to talk to the network for this one reason
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.300]   and this one thing."
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:19.260]   It's a very sort of broad strokes, and it doesn't give the user a clear idea of what
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:20.260]   your app is doing.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.660]   So that's Daniel's big concern.
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:26.140]   The other concern is that some people are worried that that checkbox that you're talking about
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:30.620]   is going to push it so that now everybody has to sell everything through the App Store
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:34.460]   and pay their Apple tax for every purchase that happens.
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:37.460]   That's a reasonable fear because I think that is where Apple wants to go, but I don't
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:38.940]   think they'll ever go there 100%.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.300]   I don't think they're going to do it.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.260]   I don't think they're going to force anybody to do it other than the fact that people like
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.260]   me--
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:45.260]   Culture will do.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.260]   Yeah, culturally.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:48.900]   I mean, I know that if an application is not very expensive, especially if it's like
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:52.580]   a little application, if I don't see it in the App Store, I just kind of go, "Eh,
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:53.580]   it has to be really unique."
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:54.580]   I love the store.
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:55.580]   You're like really special.
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:56.580]   Otherwise, I'm just like, "No."
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.580]   I won't buy it.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.580]   Really?
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:01.580]   Yeah, because it's just too much trouble.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:02.580]   I got to pull out my credit card and stuff like that.
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:05.740]   You know, like I really am-- and the other thing is is that I open up a new computer, like
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.740]   I buy my new--
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.740]   So easy.
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:11.100]   --the biggest thing is is that when I open up-- like I'm going to-- I buy a new computer
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.860]   today, when it shows up, I'm going to--
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.860]   I'll log into the App Store.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:17.420]   I'm going to log into the App Store and just say, "Install."
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.300]   You know, and I'm going to put all these apps back on, and then I'll go through the hell
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:24.460]   of adding the other applications that I have to go add.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.580]   You know, with all the weird little-- where did I put that serial code?
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:32.060]   You know, and go through my database to find the right serial numbers and, you know, I'm
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.060]   kind of over that.
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:39.180]   What are your-- what are your readers saying about the iOSification of OS X?
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.180]   Do they welcome that?
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.620]   Okay, that's part of this.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:47.140]   Yeah, I think, you know, the old time users are afraid and they take it to the extreme
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:50.740]   where they say, "Well, Apple is going to lock us in and we're not going to be able
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:52.020]   to do anything anymore."
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:55.300]   You know, originally people were thinking, "Well, AppleScript won't work and automated
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.020]   won't work," and they will.
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.420]   They're going to work fun.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.940]   So, you know, again, the people who like to tingle with their stuff-- and there are
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:08.300]   a lot of people who've been using Macs for a really long time and are like being able
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:14.140]   to get into the library folder and muck around with preference files and throw things around,
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:15.140]   they're concerned about it.
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:20.020]   I don't know that their concern is necessarily warranted much of the time.
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:24.140]   They look at the Pro apps and look at something like Final Cut Pro X and think, "Well, this
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:25.140]   is the direction.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:29.380]   Look, they're really abandoning the Pro's even though there's some fabulous capabilities
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:30.980]   in these things."
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:35.220]   And so think that, well, maybe the Mac isn't for us anymore and then if we want to do really
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:39.300]   high-end stuff, we're going to have to somewhere else do it.
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:44.740]   But I think those people who've come from the iOS as their initial experience have come
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.100]   to the Mac and go, "Oh, good.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:48.540]   This is very much like what I've experienced before."
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.340]   So that launchpad for them makes complete sense.
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:52.340]   Right.
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:56.860]   But to me, it seems like a completely stupid feature or the scrolling direction, which
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:01.420]   is a small thing for some people, but for old-time Mac users, it's a huge thing because they've
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:06.540]   been doing it for 25 years that way and now they have to do it a different way.
[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:13.700]   When you've adopted this machine as your pet to have somebody come in and change, put
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:18.500]   the back legs on the front legs instead and put the tail on top of the head, it makes
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:22.780]   them unhappy because it's not the way it was before and they don't want to change.
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:26.180]   They want things as they were, which I think is one of the interesting numbers that came
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:29.780]   up today was where Apple was saying that 40% of people are online.
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:31.260]   I thought that was a small number.
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.260]   It seemed like that.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:34.940]   As they said, "Wow, 40%."
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:35.940]   But it is.
[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:36.940]   It seems like it should be more.
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:41.220]   They made it easy and virtually 30 bucks to upgrade all the machines.
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:46.940]   And I would love to see the numbers Tiger versus Leopard or Leopard versus Snow Leopard,
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:48.700]   for example, compared to where we are now.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:52.820]   They compared it to Windows, which is an easy target.
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:56.380]   But I would love to see the data on what the conversion was like.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.260]   But I have to say, the versions of the last 10.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.740]   The Lion update has been hard.
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:01.820]   I updated my last computer over the weekend.
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:04.500]   It was a disaster to the Lion.
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:05.500]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.660]   Unmitigated disaster, really.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:13.300]   So, by the way, if you have a software raid on your Mac Pro and you go from Snow Leopard to
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.540]   Lion, it'll break the raid.
[01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:21.700]   If it's striped zero, then you got to talk to disk savers about getting that data back.
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.860]   Fortunately, you back most of it up because we had the back.
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:24.860]   That's not good.
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.620]   But it's a big bummer.
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:27.620]   That's not good.
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:32.620]   So, yeah, I think that Lion was a much larger update as far as the experience.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:35.660]   And I think that I kind of resisted it and only did it very slowly.
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:39.420]   And there's a lot of compatibility issues with a lot of things as it moved forward.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.860]   I think people who moved slowly were probably smart.
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:44.740]   I did it like one computer at a time and just very slowly.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:48.740]   I thought I had all figured it out until this weekend and then realized I hadn't thought
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.740]   of that.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:54.900]   And this makes me wonder why they, even though Mountain Lion will be out next month, they
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.620]   have noon laptops today when they really could have put them out with Lion already on them
[01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:00.900]   and avoided this whole problem.
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.060]   I guess we're going to hurry to get the hardware out.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.060]   I'm not complaining.
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:08.820]   Please, send it to me now.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.980]   The keynote, by the way, is up now on the Apple site.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:11.980]   You can watch it.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:16.780]   I don't cast it, but frankly, this warning terrifies me.
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:20.020]   So we'll come to your house.
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.500]   I guess I'm...
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:25.660]   Well, considering you already broadcast a bootleg version.
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:26.660]   Why did what?
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:27.660]   No, I...
[01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:28.660]   Nothing.
[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:31.540]   He opened sourced it, that's all.
[01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:32.620]   Well, that's right.
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.220]   He was time shifting it from...
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:40.620]   Yeah, but I hadn't read that warning at first.
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:41.620]   So I didn't know...
[01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.700]   How could you know that?
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:48.020]   How could I possibly know that they would assert such draconian rights to something that
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:52.460]   is in fact a public announcement?
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.780]   But they want you to download their movie and watch it at the quality that they had
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:57.780]   planned.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.780]   I encourage everybody to do that exactly.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:02.060]   So the Verge, I don't know how.
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:05.700]   Maybe they went out and bought one, but they've got pictures of the new MacBook Pro.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:09.100]   I guess could you go to a store, Apple Store, and get it right now?
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.100]   Oh, they probably had a demo area.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.820]   Demo, no, this is in a box.
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.020]   This looks like they bought it.
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.020]   Oh, really?
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:16.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:17.020]   It could be at the stores.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.020]   Oh, they may have been given one.
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.020]   Apple will do that with certain outlets.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.020]   I'm sure the Verge got one.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:24.700]   I guess because the Verge would never do anything like rebroadcast, Apple's keynote without prior
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.400]   permission.
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.400]   They get one.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.180]   I think that's the warning they really should have put up.
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:34.180]   If you play any part of this keynote, we're not going to invite you to future keynotes.
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:36.180]   And yeah, we're not going to send you anything for free.
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:37.940]   This MagSafe looks very different, by the way.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:41.460]   It's got a big metal thing around it.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.700]   Is it funny how the computers keep getting smaller so they had to get rid of the ethernet
[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:47.380]   plug because it's too tall and they had to get rid of the firewire because it's too
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:50.980]   tall and eventually only really skinny connectors will work?
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:55.540]   I hope the IETF keeps this in mind.
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.980]   That's part of my skepticism about this.
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:00.980]   I mean, what is exactly pro about this?
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:07.380]   And at what point do you say, look, if you're going to take $2,500 from me, don't I get ethernet?
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:11.620]   Don't I get more than 256 gigabyte hard drive?
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:13.540]   I mean, this is it's nice.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:14.540]   It's lovely.
[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:16.540]   But man, the value per--
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:19.900]   They should call it elite or--
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.740]   As you call it, F and extreme.
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:22.740]   FX.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:26.180]   I mean, the thing is, I mean, it's got two thunderbolts, two USB 3s.
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.860]   I mean, this thing is the most monstrous with an HDMI out to--
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.620]   From a connectivity point of view.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:33.940]   Yeah, but with SSDs and fast--
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:35.900]   That's all I got to say.
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:38.220]   I mean, I'll take the--
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:40.940]   This is the computer I've been waiting for my entire life.
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:42.100]   See, here's the difference, Andy.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:45.780]   You and I think about the cost.
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:46.580]   Alex does not.
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:50.700]   I just think about how many cameras I can hook into it at one time.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:55.740]   No, Alex is rapidly turning into the scot-borne of the show.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:59.220]   The thing is, I want people to know is that I'm not buying these for myself personally.
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:25:59.420]   Exactly.
[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.780]   Like, it's not your money.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.860]   It's a company that, you know, and these things generate--
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.060]   I'm not wealthy.
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.060]   They generate it.
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.060]   They generate revenue.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:07.580]   That's right.
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.580]   They are-- this is not my home computer or my home computer.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:10.820]   I don't have a home computer.
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:13.580]   I just have what I-- I have my iPad.
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.940]   But this is stuff that is working.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:17.420]   They pay themselves off and we use.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.740]   I just wanted to say it's not--
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.260]   It's like to tease you.
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:22.940]   Although I have to say, whenever I want to buy Pixelcore, there's always like seven
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.580]   or eight new boxes of new stuff.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.020]   You have the best toy budget ever.
[01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:30.460]   We need a lot of toys.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.020]   Actually, this is a good moment for me to speak.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.580]   You know, we do contract programming.
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:36.020]   So I have a whole team of nerds at home probably listening right now.
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:40.940]   And I want to say no new laptop for you.
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.500]   It doesn't make you more money.
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.860]   Hey, tell us a little bit about that.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:48.540]   Tell us a little bit about that big nerd ranch and your upcoming classes and so forth.
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:49.460]   So big nerd ranch--
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:50.620]   Do you only do them in Georgia?
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:50.980]   Do you ever do?
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:53.820]   No, we do them in Atlanta.
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:55.220]   But we also do them in Amsterdam.
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.900]   So next week, we're doing an iOS course in Atlanta.
[01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:00.700]   And the week after that, we'll do the same course in Amsterdam.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:04.020]   Yeah, we have a great little place where you come and stay for the week.
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:05.620]   And we take care of everything.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.860]   We room and board, and we send you home again.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:10.100]   So that's going on.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:13.580]   I'll be at the Apple Store in San Francisco on Wednesday talking.
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.460]   And the boys to men are coming on after me.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.220]   So you definitely want to be there.
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:19.100]   It'll be busy.
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.100]   Wow.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.380]   And we do contract programming.
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:25.540]   So we develop applications for people, both iOS, Android, and desktop.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.940]   And if you want to learn desktop programming, we teach that as well.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:29.380]   So if you want to learn cocoa programming,
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:30.980]   we're doing a class in August.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:31.820]   So jump back.
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.220]   Do you have any coding anymore, Andrew?
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:36.060]   I do some coding.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:40.460]   I mean, Aaron, company gets to a point where you have to do a lot of start management stuff.
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:42.220]   So how much coding do you do, though?
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:42.660]   None.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:43.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.580]   But see, it's a hobby for me.
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:45.740]   It's not in my business.
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.500]   And like you, you took the class, right?
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:47.980]   I took the class.
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:48.580]   It was amazing.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.740]   And it's a fun hobby.
[01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:50.780]   It's a really, really great class.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.540]   It's a really great class.
[01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:52.500]   Yeah, it was a really great class.
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.740]   And I didn't take it with the intention that I would write code.
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:59.140]   I took it with the intention that I could talk to coders in a useful way.
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.420]   Like I understand how that structure works.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:06.220]   So when I'm thinking about applications, which we're actually going to be most likely contracting
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:10.980]   through big, big, big grant, that I can think about that structure so I can explain, this
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:13.380]   is what I wanted to do, knowing what's possible and not possible.
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:15.820]   But there were people that were in the class that were definitely coding.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:20.740]   And it was-- it's just a great-- it's a great class, I think, that is the way to learn it.
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:23.100]   And I think sequestering yourself is different than buying a book.
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:27.020]   It's a question in yourself, in a room, talking to someone who really knows what they're doing
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:28.260]   is much different than reading a book.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:32.500]   Well, so you need a space to experiment and somebody to kind of keep you on track.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.460]   So that's a different experience than the book.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:38.980]   With the book, I hope that you have that space and maybe someone to mentor you a little bit.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.220]   Yeah, no, I need the class.
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.220]   Yeah, the class.
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:42.220]   I'm coming to the class.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.220]   I'm just too 80D.
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:47.380]   And what's fun about coding, a lot of people don't realize, is all the little small victories.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.380]   A lot of people think they don't want to be coders.
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:53.660]   And then once you get into it and you do this little fix and then it works and you're like,
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:54.660]   "Oh, look at that button."
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:56.660]   You get 20 little victories in a day.
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:57.660]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:01.900]   And when you're management, you get a victory every year or so.
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:03.900]   Yeah, it's a different feeling.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:04.900]   It's a long, long.
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:09.500]   I mostly just fail all day and then I get to the end and still it was okay.
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:10.780]   Highly recommend Aaron's books.
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:14.980]   And of course, you got to go to BigNerdRanch.com and find out more about their classes all over
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:15.980]   the world.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:17.180]   So good to have you.
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.300]   Thank you for abandoning the keynote to be here.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.300]   It's always a pleasure.
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.300]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:22.300]   Greatful.
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:23.300]   And Inako, thank you for being here.
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:24.300]   So I take it.
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.620]   The new Mac book is not on your agenda, not on your list.
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:29.620]   Enough for purchase.
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:35.780]   No, I did buy a new Mac book last year, but it's definitely, I'm expecting FedEx up the
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:36.780]   street any day now.
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:37.780]   Oh, I'm jealous.
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:38.780]   What's up there?
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:39.780]   I can borrow.
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:40.780]   Have fun.
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:41.780]   Have fun.
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:47.580]   Chris Breen, I imagine you'll be playing with it pretty soon too at Macworldmagazinemacworld.com.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.580]   I expect I will.
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:50.380]   I may get one.
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:53.460]   I'm about three years out on a new Mac.
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:55.780]   So this one is tempting.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:56.780]   Yeah.
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:03.020]   And I think if you get the Thunderbolt cinema display on that thing, I can sell my Mac Pro
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:07.860]   for probably $300 or $400 and make it down payment.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:08.860]   $303.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:14.460]   That's a pretty shocking result.
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.660]   Just stab me in the gut.
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:16.660]   That's all I can say.
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:19.940]   That's the point which you suspend your presidential campaign and release your delegates.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.940]   Yes, exactly.
[01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:23.420]   Exactly.
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:25.620]   Thank you for being here, Chris and Andy and Aaron.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.580]   Thank you, Alex, for coming home just for this event.
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.060]   Are you hitting the road again soon?
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.060]   Yeah, I'll be in.
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.060]   I'm hoping to check in from London next week.
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.060]   Wow.
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.540]   So I'll be there for next week.
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:37.260]   I hope to have you for next week.
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:39.780]   And we thank you all for joining us.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:40.780]   We did this a little early.
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.260]   So don't tune in tomorrow for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:46.060]   Actually, what we did is we flip flopped with Scott Wilkinson and home theater geeks.
[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:49.460]   Michael Fremmer will be his guest to be talking about audio.
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.620]   It should be a lot of fun.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.940]   Home theater geeks, normally at this time, will be tomorrow on twit.tv.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:31:00.860]   And we'll be back the following week, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, time 1800 UTC every
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:04.180]   Tuesday with Mac Break Weekly.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:06.100]   Don't forget coming up in about an hour.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:11.180]   It's less now because we got out of here on time TNT tech news today and they'll have
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:16.060]   more about the keynote and more analysis and information as well.
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.140]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:22.020]   And now it's time to get back to work this break time.
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.380]   Iso, see you later.
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:33.380]   [MUSIC]
