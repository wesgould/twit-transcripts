[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.600]   And yes, there's some news. Alex Lindsey is here from 090.media and Office Hours.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   It's the credit card. It's a little hot.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600]   It's a little hot. It's like, I just keep trying to keep it out of frame.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   It's just like this little bellowing thing coming up out of my pan.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   Andy and I go also here, WGBH in Boston, Renee. Getting briefed.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   I'm surprised.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   I don't see it on the camera, but can you see is like the ghost of my dad, like manifesting over my right shoulder?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   Now, son, you have $2,000. You even have $4,000.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   That doesn't mean now is a good time to spend $4,000 on a new--
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   Oh, now is an excellent time to spend $4,000.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   That is very right. That's the very sensible voice that comes in my head.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   So, we are still a little giddy, having just come off Apple's peak performance event.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   I will admit I was wrong. There were no VR headsets.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   We were not peaking at anything that's not yet out.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   In fact, it should have been P-E-A-K performance because it was all about performance.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   We will cover it all, but we might hasten through the first bits to get to the really juicy stuff.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   Just your thoughts, Andy, about the whole event.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   There's a lot of big messaging here.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   First of all, I was a little bit surprised there was no messaging about Ukraine,
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   although Tim Cook has made public statements in the past couple of weeks.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   I was thinking about that.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   I think the reason for that is that this was pre-recorded,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   and the risk of pre-recording something that would be unfortunate at the last minute was too high.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   Rather than say anything.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   Maybe.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   It may have been finished before the year.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   The war?
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   All the shoot may have happened before the war.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   Other than that, a lot of really great specific announcements that we're going to get into,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   but there was such tidy storytelling and messaging.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   I thought it was super interesting that this wasn't presented as,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   and now let's bring out so-and-so to talk about iPhone.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   Now let's talk about so-and-so to talk about Macintosh.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   This was really presented as an Apple Silicon event.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   Here are three expressions of how we're using Apple Silicon,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   which I thought was just huge.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   Another note since we're talking about broad stuff.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   Okay, bad.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   I mean, I was-
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   Now, if you're going where I think you're going, that was a bad choice of words.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   I'm very, very sorry.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   I didn't mean- I'm saying I did notice and did appreciate that there were very, very few men chosen as presenters here.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   Even when they did, like here's a video testimonials from developers
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   when they're talking about the new processor, they were all talking to
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   non-male developers.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   And it's because it's International Women's Day today.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   And Tim Cook every year, in fact, tweets that celebrating women.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   And it was very appropriate.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   I noticed it too, Annie, that all the creators were women.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   Bravo, Apple.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   And also because I'm sure that we've been doing the show for over a decade.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   So we've been through some dark times.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   So it's not just that, hey, we found some women who were working as managers at Apple to put thrust on stage.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   It was no, it's just that the person who's in charge of iPhone, the person who's in charge of this is a female executive.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   And so, of course, we chose that person.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   So lots of more stuff that we'll get into when we get there.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   But yeah, I thought that it was absolutely solid gold as a presentation.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   So tidy, they're keeping their messaging on point.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   And once again, underscores that how laser focused and precise they can be when they pre-record and pre-edit everything.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   If you look at, though, Tim Cook's blue sweater and his yellow watch band, there is a subtle point Ukrainian message in there.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   So I think they did, in fact, record this after the war broke out 12, 13 days ago.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.600]   I was saying at the beginning, I bet you they had Tim Cook standing by his latest last night.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   If he's going to mention Ukraine, he's going to be able to modify it.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   So I think that there was probably wise for them just to avoid it altogether.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   Very changed, quickly evolving situation.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   If there was some sort of disaster even later on today, that...
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   Yeah, and we know where they stand on it because none of these products will be available in Russia.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   Well, they also put the Crimea back into the Ukraine.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   Oh, did they? Good for them.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   Is that everywhere or just in the US?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   I think it's everywhere.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   Not in Russia, but yeah, they changed it specifically because they were forced to do so.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   The invasion was in 2014.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   In 2019, they and other map makers changed it because in Russia it became against the law to represent the borders as non-Russian.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   And so this was your basic flipping the bird back at Russia saying, "Okay, we don't even care anymore."
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   They are following the laws of the country in which they are operating, but elsewhere.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   It is not, as has been said, a disputed region.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   Now they're saying specifically, "No, this is this territory belongs to Ukraine."
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   Well, one way to avoid that issue is to not sell your products in that country, and that's the other thing.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   Exactly.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   Join the club.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   I think that overall...
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   I think that the...
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   I have to say...
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   So I don't understand why they're using teleprompters for records.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   You know, like I just don't get it.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   It takes a lot of the spontaneity out of it.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   It's just...
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   Well, and it's this...
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   Every sentence has a gap.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   You know, now the women who presented the...
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   That was genuine.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   They were really good.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   Because they were talking.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   That was some of the best presentation I've seen in a long time at an Apple keynote, or almost any keynote outside of Salesforce.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   Salesforce trains their folks a lot harder than everybody else, and so there's a really good...
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   But outside of that, Apple tends to be a little stale.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   And I feel like they just don't need that.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   They're pre-recording.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   And I know that takes time for someone to be able to do it from memory, but you only have to do it in little chunks.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.600]   So I think that...
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   And I have to admit that watching this, I kind of started to feel like, "Do we really need the motif of a stage anymore?
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   Can we just make this a show?"
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   You know, like I don't...
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   It was... I do want to get to the actual products, but this is the meta conversation.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   It was interesting that they eliminated, they eschewed the production elements they had used in the past.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.600]   The drone shots, the zooming around, all of that stuff.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   Remember, for a while, we thought, "Oh, now they're going to start to branch out and do bits of it from the Grand Canyon and bits of it from..."
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   None of that.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   I thought that was really exciting, and I thought this one was really boring compared to it.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   Yeah, I don't know why do you think...
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   Do you think that we did this in a hurry?
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   I think that they might be preparing to go back to a stage in the near future.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   So ramp down.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   Ramp down.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   Yeah, ramp it back down again, which I think is not going to work.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   I think that they're going to eventually have to turn back towards the production, because I think that the production was great.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   And I think that if I hadn't been watching with 150 people on Zoom, I probably would have just decided I'd wait and look at the notes.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   It was too slow.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   I think that was the thing for me.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   On the other hand, was hyperventilating through at least the second half.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   So I didn't feel like it was slow at all.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   Well, once we got to that, we're not in office hours, we're not the market for the SE, so we were just like, "Okay, let's go."
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   So probably nobody listening is either, but the first segment of the show, we're going to do all the boring stuff.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   We're going to get that out of the way.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   And then we're going to get to the good stuff.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600]   And actually, I think there's a lot to be said about the iPad Air.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   There's some interesting, I have some real questions about that.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   But first, they started everything off with an advertisement for Apple TV, plus all the things they have.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   All the awards are nominated for...
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.600]   Friday night baseball.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   That's the big announcement, right?
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   They got baseball.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   Of course, it's going to be a shortened season.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   And I think people have stopped caring baseball by now.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   They only have two games, exclusive to Apple TV Plus.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   I think that the MLB was the obvious first choice because basically, HLS is built around what MLB was.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   Oh, interesting.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   You know, like so.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   That's because I remember this.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   This goes back to the days with Major League Baseball, who was very early on the streaming platform with MLB.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   Didn't they go to somebody who disappointed them, who let them down?
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   They came to HLS and Apple basically has designed that HLS around what MLB wanted.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   And so a lot of that pipeline is so well formed inside of the MLB pipeline.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   And so it would be...
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   I mean, obviously, there's some support on the app and everything else, but it's effortless from Apple's perspective,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   from a transmission perspective to carry live games from MLB because it's using exactly what Apple uses.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   They went, I think, to HBO first, though, didn't they?
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   They might have.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   I mean, back in the day, streaming was very...
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   Do you remember this history?
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   This is eight, seven or eight years ago.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   They were buying ears.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   Oh, I used more than that.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.600]   And I feel like they went to one company that...
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.600]   And I can't remember who it was.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   And we have to remember that it was the Wild Wild West before HLS because I remember...
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   HLS is what everybody...
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   You know, YouTube delivers your videos in HLS.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   So before HLS, it was kind of the Wild Wild West and things kind of worked and kind of didn't work and everything else.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.600]   And then MLB kind of figured this out and they started making a lot of requests.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   And they've gotten a lot of those requests.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   HLS is HTTP live streaming.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   It's Apple's...
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   It's basically HTML5 streaming.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   Kind of.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   No, I don't know.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   It pre-exists that.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   It was really...
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   But it was an HTTP protocol.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   And basically, it's not streaming in the way we'd think of it.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   It's just copying files to your drive and deleting them really fast.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   So it's not really streaming.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   Because basically what's happening is you take segments and those segments might be two seconds long or six seconds long and they have a time to live.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   So basically, they come to you and they drop them off, you watch them and then very quickly after that they get rid of them.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:14.600]   And so that's what Apple figured out how to do rather than trying to actually stream it to you.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.600]   And it made it a lot more stable.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   So, Friday Night Baseball, there were rumors that they were negotiating with the NFL for something that would be much more valuable.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   And much more expensive, the Sunday ticket, which is currently on DirecTV.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   I'm sure they would like to have announced that.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   That may have actually been why they held up recording this because they would like to announce that.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   But that deal has not been done.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   So they've got baseball.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   This is very much Apple.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   This is really on message for Apple TV Plus.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   We don't have the best stuff.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   But we have some good stuff.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   But it's not the best stuff.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   Well, but they can, I think that if they were responsible for carrying one-twelfth of NFL games in a season,
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   that would have put a huge responsibility on them.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.600]   And I think it would have limited what they can do with it.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600]   They're trying to get it.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600]   No, they're trying to get it.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   No, they're trying to get it.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   No, but I believe that.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   But I like the idea that this is not the entire season.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   It's not until August or September that these games are going to be hugely important.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   If they get the ability to talk to MLB and work out coverage together, that we can have, we can create an app for Apple TV
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   that basically makes it so much easier to get through the tedious points of baseball.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   That you can change camera angles.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   You can basically decide what kind of coverage that you want.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   I would love to see them do for live sports coverage.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   What they managed to do with their power on the first iPhone, on how the internet works on a phone.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   They're able to talk to AT&T and say, what if you don't just have limited mobile-only text-based apps?
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   What if you actually gave people a real connection to the internet?
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   I think there could be a lot of great stuff being done there.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   And I'm a fan of baseball.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   So I'm not the person who's screaming that, "Oh, the game should be 45 minutes long and there should be paintball guns
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   that they have to run through from second to third."
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:18.600]   I think that actually baseball is one of the best baseball and cricket are really good sports for interactivity
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.600]   because it's moving so slowly that you can do a lot of things in between.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   So the thing is being able to have extra commentary, people chatting, extra data, all these things.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   Those golf, cricket, baseball, the problem with doing those kinds of things with basketball or soccer or even football
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   is that everything's moving so quickly.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   And it's always happening, it's always coming at you.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   Whereas this is one that's a little bit more of a slow pace, but what we're missing is not, yeah, we don't need to shorten the game.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   What we need to do is add things in between.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.600]   Now when I grew up, we were keeping that little scorecard the whole game.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   So I was a very busy game.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   But the very busy game.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   Let's say the demographics of baseball are terrible.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   It's for old people.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.600]   It's slow-moving.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   Viewership for the World Series this year was half what it was five years ago.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   It is not a growth sport.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   It's the second sport you'd really want.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   I mean, if you're talking global, you'd want soccer or maybe cricket, but in the US you want NFL.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:26.600]   Recently as a week ago, from the Sports Business Journal, Apple and Amazon front runners for the Sunday ticket,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   we reported that last week.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   I'm sure that they were trying to get this done before the event today.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   And I really think that this was, okay, we'll settle for Sunday, baseball and Friday.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   And hopefully we're going to see some innovation.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.600]   The thing is that right now, even with Amazon, Amazon's done a little bit of work on the Thursday night football ticket
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   where they don't like it doing a 4K stream.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   It's yes.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   But I think that I'd love to see them push, you know, I'd love to see Apple with MLB on the games that they cover
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.600]   do things like high frame rate, HDR, you know, and interactivity.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   There's a whole second screen experience with iPads and iPhones that isn't being utilized.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   And I think that that's the kind of stuff that could be really interesting.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   And that's the only reason that NFL would even talk to them.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.600]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   Money is a big reason.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   And it's a $2 billion package.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   It's inexpensive.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   I mean, Apple can pay anything that they ask for.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   I think what they have to do is figure out, does that reduce their relevancy if they lose all broadcasts?
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   You know, from the least important event announcement in this event, to the second least important,
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   the iPhone will now come in Alpine Green.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   No, no, no, but you know, only Alpine Green, if you cut out for the pro model, they have a green for the peons,
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   for the poppers.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.600]   They all find the reason for the folks.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   The fancy folk.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.600]   Money versus new money.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   But then as soon as they did that, the whole tone changed because Tim Cook said, now let's talk about Apple Silicon.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   And as you said, this is really where Apple shines.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.600]   They are pulling away.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.600]   They are at, I mean, we saw this one when M1 came out and it was that popular at this pace,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   it's going to take them like two or three more updates before anyone's even close.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   It's mind boggling what they're doing.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   They did start slow with the iPhone SE, which really looks like the vintage, the retro iPhone with its rounded corners
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   and a touch ID button and all of that.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   But it does have the latest processor, the A15 Bionic in it.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.600]   It supports 5G.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   I thought that that was very, very significant.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   I think that they're very, very clearly saying, given that there's way more performance inside every iPhone
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:44.600]   than anybody is ever going to use, particularly when you get to the iPhone SE, they could easily get by with the A14,
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   the A13, something older.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   I think the fact that they're putting the same chip in every single phone that they make makes it really clear
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.600]   that whatever they intend to do in the near future with software, with operating systems, with services,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:02.600]   they don't want to have a line of demarcation between iPhone users who can use this and iPhone users who can't use this.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   They want every iPhone to be able to run the exact same software and it's probably going to be what...
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.600]   That's smart.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   And they need the neural engine to do it.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   So this makes the whole platform a lot more interesting than I usually react to for refreshing the iPhone SE.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:25.600]   This is, if you don't care about having all the fancy cameras, you want to save the prices $429 is starting price.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:31.600]   Comes in product red, white and black, which they call Starlight in midnight, respectively.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   But look, it really feels like an old-fashioned iPhone.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.600]   I think that this really appeals to a lot of normal people.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.600]   This is the iPhone that most people will want.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:49.600]   I have to say, after Apple's announcement two years ago of 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, I was very skeptical at that point.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   And it's true that millimeter wave 5G has been very as fast as it is, has been very limited in its reach.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   Now that mid-band 5G is coming out, very rapidly.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   Low-band, which T-Mobile's had in others for some time, isn't much faster than LTE.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   Mid-band is AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile all are doing it.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:20.600]   And I have a Verizon phone and a T-Mobile phone here in Little Podunk, Petaluma, getting the mid-band, they call it UW on Verizon and UC on T-Mobile.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.600]   And it's 500 megabits down and 30 megabits up.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   It's really fast.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   Fast enough that I would even consider the residential service from Verizon as a good alternative for ISP.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.600]   What do we use in your phone?
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.600]   Well, residential ISP for one.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.600]   Presidential, yeah.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   Is the price right?
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   Yeah, it's very comparable to cable.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   It's a little less than, maybe 10 bucks less than cable.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:52.600]   So, but also, if you can get 500 down and 30 up, you want a phone that can do it.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   I mean, admittedly there's other issues because you're going to hit your data cap pretty quick that way.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.600]   But the point is it's now much more widespread.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   Every company's rolling it out very quickly.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:11.600]   And so 5G maybe is more important than it was back when it was all for the place 5G.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.600]   64 gigs is the base model.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.600]   256 gigs is the top.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   That's good too, by the way.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   I'm tired of people calling me saying, "I only have eight gigs on my iPhone.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   How can I upgrade it?"
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   You've got to do that if you want to keep it up to date.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   And that's the most important thing.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.600]   This will be getting all the updates.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   All the other iPhones will be getting.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.600]   Some people want a 4.7 inch screen.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.600]   I think that there's a market for that.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.600]   Do they still do the mini?
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.600]   I don't even remember.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   It's nice here that we use a lot of these phones oftentimes as like extras or one of the company phones or whatever.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   And it's good to have one that's not so expensive to fill those gaps.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.600]   And for kids, you know, like these are the kind of one I wouldn't spend $1,000 for my kid.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.600]   No, $500 maybe.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   It gets people in the market, right?
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.600]   Also, they don't want to have that line.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   They don't want to have that separation between people are going to be buying Android phones for their kids.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   They want to make sure that they all stay in the family on one thing.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.600]   Yeah, that's super important.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.600]   So there's definitely a market for these.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.600]   I'm sure they sell well.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   So welcome to the iPhone.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   It's weird because it doesn't have a number.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.600]   So it's hard to, you know, it's just the SE.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   But it's the new SE with the A15 Bionic in it.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.600]   And by the way, 13, many is still a thing.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.600]   It is a thing.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   Okay.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.600]   Yes.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.600]   You don't, they don't talk about it.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   I don't, I, and the thing, and the thing is what, what would you get out of it?
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.600]   You can get higher capacity.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   It does come in green.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.600]   You do get the basic D.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.600]   Now, but the A15 is now a great leveler in this entire thing.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   Okay.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   You also get the dual camera system.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.600]   So okay, you're getting stuff with it.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.600]   Yeah, you're getting a little bit more.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.600]   By the way, everything we're going to talk about, and this is the other thing.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.600]   Hallelujah.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.600]   Will be or available for a pre-order today.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:13.600]   Like before the show even ended, I was ordering the new studio Mac and delivering, if you get
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.600]   it in time as early as March 18th, the week from Friday.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   So there, there were no, this was not a peak at something coming.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.600]   Exactly.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   They did at the very end.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   Say, okay, we've done all of it except for one Mac.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   There's still one Mac.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.600]   We're going to do a Mac Pro.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   My pre-stilled account.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   And I think that they like, it looked a little smug like, like, here's what we did before we
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   did the Mac Pro.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   Like, watch what happens now.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   I mean, my mind's already blown with what they announced today.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.600]   I don't know what a Mac Pro is going to look like, but we're going to get to that.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   We're going to get to that.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   Let's take a break now.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   I'm trying to, trying to divide this into three chunks.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   So we'll do the iPad next.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.600]   That'll be a fairly short thing compared to the big chunk, which is going to be new
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.600]   Macs, new monitor.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   Very.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   My order's in.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   Yeah, we're in.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.600]   Several.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   We talk about our stuff.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.600]   We're already burning up.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.600]   He's heating up.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   Just how many did you buy?
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   I just bought one.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   I already have eight Mac men.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600]   No, I know.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   Like, I actually bought three.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   I bought one for me.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.600]   High end.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   One for Lisa.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   Medium end.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.600]   And one for Micah, because he needed a new, he was due for a new computer.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   And plus, he doesn't have an M1.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   And he's the host of iOS today.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:45.200]   And so he needs to look at iOS apps on the Mac, which, by the way, Apple was spent some
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.600]   time saying, "By the way, iOS apps on the Mac, don't forget.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.600]   Don't forget."
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.600]   That's very important.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.600]   All right.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:58.600]   We'll have, I was, by the way, during this, they're teasing it out.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   And I'm going crazy.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   And I'm going to do the same thing to you.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   Yeah, we're not going to tell you what we actually got.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   Teasing it out.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   We'll get there.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.600]   I'll tell you it.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   We'll get to it.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.600]   But first, I want to talk about imperfect foods, which as far as I'm concerned is absolutely
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.600]   perfect.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   Thursday's imperfect food day at the LaPorte household.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:24.920]   Imperfect foods is a grocery delivery service that makes you feel good.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.440]   You know, combating climate change feels like it's big.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   It's overwhelming.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.720]   What can you do one person all by yourself?
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.600]   Well, you can make an impact with imperfect foods.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.480]   It's a grocery delivery service offering an entire line of sustainable groceries that
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:46.360]   tastes delicious and reduce waste just by embracing the natural imperfections in food.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.200]   Now, before I go too much farther, because I know you're going to want this, I want to
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.440]   tell you, you should go to imperfectfoods.com, make sure that it's available in your area.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.880]   It is not available in all areas.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.040]   But if it is, you are in luck.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.880]   So the idea initially was there's a lot of produce that grocers won't stock because they
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.960]   only want the giantest apples, the pomegranates as big as your head.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:16.640]   You know, and they, and there's, which means that as much as a third of the US food creation
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.680]   is just, is just not never sold.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.720]   It's thrown away, fed to animals, but it's never sold because grocers say, no, no, no,
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   I can't sell that apple.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.160]   It looks like it just was on a tree.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.520]   Well, I grew up with apples off the tree.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.320]   They're sweeter, they're better.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.560]   And that's what you get within perfect foods.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.120]   Delicious produce.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.680]   The grocer didn't want to carry, but is better than anything you've, you've had in a long
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.680]   time.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:46.080]   It's fresh, it's seasonal, but now they even sell all your favorite pantry staples, yummy
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.080]   snacks.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:52.360]   The meats that they sell have the same kind of philosophy, sustainable man, the heritage
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.960]   chickens we get at imperfect foods are fantastic.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:00.400]   Now once you sign up, every week you could personalize your order, choose what you want
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.800]   from that big range.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.480]   They have dairy as well.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.640]   Your order will arrive on the same day every week.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.080]   Like I said, ours is Thursday, but they do that on purpose because they want to consolidate
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.200]   all the deliveries in your area into one day, which reduces emissions.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:22.400]   In fact, delivering weekly by neighborhood produces 25 to 75% fewer emissions than all
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.760]   those people going to the grocery store.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.720]   On average, imperfect food customers save six to eight pounds of food with every order.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.120]   Food that would go would just not be in the system.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.760]   So you're really doing a good thing for the planet and a good thing to yourself.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.640]   They're the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return your
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.280]   packaging after every order.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.920]   They minimize plastics.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.560]   I always just break down the box, put all the packaging together.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.440]   Sometimes there's a cool, you know, a cool wrap and an ice bag.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.120]   I put that all together, leave it on the porch when they come on Thursday, they pick it up,
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.600]   recycle it.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.320]   So you don't have that guilt that you've got a lot of packaging.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.880]   You just have great food right now.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.600]   20% off your first four orders.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.920]   Yes.

[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.680]   20% off your first four orders, that's up to an $80 value.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.920]   That imperfect foods.com.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.840]   I am P E R F E C T foods.com.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.040]   Just don't forget to use a promo code MAC break that way.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.920]   They know you saw it here.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.520]   We're very we love our imperfect food delivery every Thursday.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:35.160]   We will to imperfect foods.com promo code is MAC break.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.680]   And no, we pay for I suppose I should say this.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.280]   They don't give us free groceries.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.280]   We subscribe just like you do.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.400]   Got the got the 20% off for the first four orders just like you will.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.440]   We pay the full freight.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.160]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.720]   Imperfect foods.com.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.240]   All right.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:00.640]   I think so far so good for 29 iPhone SE Friday night baseball, then they get to the iPad
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   air.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   These are things we expected.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.720]   It's got 5G in it.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.280]   It's got an M1 processor in it.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.320]   Now that's interesting, not an A 15, but an M1.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   That's the same.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.000]   Renee would tell you it's the same.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.240]   But what I thought was intriguing.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.160]   I'm curious what you think is this is really starting to verge on the iPad pro.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.240]   Same design.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.560]   Same processor, 8 core M1.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.400]   It's got USB-C.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.400]   They have a smart keyboard for it.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.640]   Starts at 599.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.800]   So it's a great price.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.320]   How do we make the distinction or maybe we're going to see it a pro leap forward?
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.920]   What's going to happen here?
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.800]   I don't know why you buy the pro now.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.760]   I mean, I've been looking at the specs just to make sure that I'm clear on things.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.960]   The biggest difference is that you don't get Thunderbolt on the air.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.840]   That Thunderbolt is now only on the iPad pro.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:04.600]   And it's a very, very tight comparison between the 10.9 inch pro and the 11 inch air.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.920]   Because even if external displays are still not a problem, because you can still connect
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:14.040]   DisplayPort through USB-C on the iPad air, you lose higher capacity storage.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.400]   You lose one camera, I think.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:24.920]   But in terms of someone who wants a mid-range iPad laptop that doesn't necessarily want
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:31.440]   a 12.9 inch display, it really is the difference between how do you define yourself as a pro.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:39.320]   And if you can dissuade yourself of needing Thunderbolt or 512 gigs of storage, it seems
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:43.800]   to sell you want to save that money and get the smart to get the magic keyboard instead.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.360]   It's a similar display, but not exactly the same as on the pro.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.360]   It's P3, True Tone.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:56.440]   But it's not like micro LED, excuse me, but it's not mini LED.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.440]   It's not as though the pro is mini LED, so you're not getting the other reason for going
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.640]   for the 12.9 when I bought mine was that I want that better display.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.600]   So there's still, you're not necessarily kicking yourself that hard for getting a pro 12.9
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   if you wanted the M1 chip.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.720]   It does have the front facing 12 megapixel camera now.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:21.840]   Everything has that centering center stage where it moves around with you, even the new
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.000]   monitor is that, which is, I thought, was kind of interesting.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.760]   So yeah, I mean, you're going to have to really look if you want to get an iPad Pro at why
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.720]   you're spending the extra money.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.360]   Yeah, I mean, there's a huge cost difference between 500 nits and I think it's 1600 nits
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.960]   on the other, on the other display.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.880]   So they are definitely saving some money there as far as that goes.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.000]   But I think that I think that it's a very usable Mac.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.480]   I mean, if I was a school, again, again, March tends to be a kind of a nod towards last
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.080]   purchases that schools might do.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.840]   It's not a bad, not a bad iPad to use.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.800]   If you're thinking about iPads, if you're in that direction.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:05.120]   Actually, honestly, this could even be a college laptop in quotes, but this is very capable
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.120]   of very solid.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.120]   And then it was fast.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.720]   They were explicit in saying the faster than the fastest competitive Windows tablet up
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.120]   to two times faster than the fastest Windows laptop in its price range.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.360]   So yeah, if that's where they're going for.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.640]   It also is a flex on Apple Silicon now, M1 everywhere.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.640]   Right.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:32.000]   It's and so this is what's really going to be interesting is just consistent improvement
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.040]   in processors.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.840]   Well, consistent and very leaps and bounds.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.840]   Leaps and bounds.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.680]   With everything, they're just there and they're starting to really flex.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.960]   And again, we saw this when the M1 came out, like when they announced that they were going
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.360]   to go, they were going to have a new chip.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.600]   A lot of us were like, we should buy a bunch of Intel machines right before they screwed
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.080]   this up for the next year or two.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:58.680]   And the first M1 came out and nobody I know, everyone's like, no more Intel.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.760]   Like we're not going to buy any more of this because you could just see what was going
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   to happen.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.640]   It was like when the M1 came out, it was like, if that's version one, this is going to get
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.640]   really interesting.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:12.720]   So we keep on seeing the level of performance change between updates.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.680]   And it's only been a year and a half.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.760]   Since the first time we saw an M1, it's going to be a really hard pace to keep up with because
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.480]   again, because it's all integrated, because they're not working with outside folks.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.600]   They don't have to figure out how to get this chip to talk to that chip.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.680]   They don't want to deal with buses.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.640]   They can design whatever they want.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.680]   Really changes the playing field a lot.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.080]   Just damn exciting.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.600]   That's what I can say.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.560]   So I'm going to see if I can find the slides.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.600]   I'm wondering if somebody has the slides.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   Do you know?
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600]   I have them.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.680]   You have them, but that doesn't help me.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.440]   Where did you get them?
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.240]   I just spring wrapped them.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.360]   Yeah, you were smart.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.200]   You were smart.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.880]   So I'm going to try to find the slides because that's, unfortunately, they move so fast
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.800]   that we seem to miss some of the details.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.400]   And they actually skim over some of the details.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:12.880]   Johnny, John Turnis comes out and says, "Well, we have the M1, we have the M1 Pro, we have
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.400]   the M1 Max, what's next?"
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:21.760]   And the slide I want is, if I can find it, is where he shows the dies of these processors.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.280]   Let me see if I can Google it.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:32.800]   M1 Pro Max Ultra, because essentially what, you know, then he says, "And now introducing
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:40.840]   the M1 Ultra, and basically the way they solve this problem is kind of how we thought, but
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:46.640]   maybe even a little bit better than we thought by dual core.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.560]   But with their new--
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   Dual dies.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   Dual dies.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:56.160]   Yeah, not dual core, but it's multi core still, but actually you're going to have 20 core
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   and more, but yet dual dies.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:04.360]   But they, Turnis set it up by saying, "The problem in the past with multi core, multi
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.040]   die architectures has been the communications.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:14.160]   And so they've introduced something called the Ultra Fusion Architecture, which has interprocessor
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:21.120]   bandwidth of 2.5 terabytes per second."
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:27.680]   Okay, right on, right on, right on.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.480]   If you take the chart, and I haven't been able to find it, but if you take the chart, you've
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.560]   got your M1, and then it gets a little fatter with the M1 Pro, and then it gets a little
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.720]   fatter with the M1 Ultra, then suddenly, or M1 Max, and you go to the Ultra, it's not
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.720]   getting fatter, it's getting taller.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.920]   It's like a skyscraper.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.440]   They've basically taken two M1 Maxes and stacked them one on top of the other.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   Very impressive.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.360]   Yeah, but they're making a real-- I love the little smirk.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.600]   They say, "Well, the M1 has always had a feature that we've been keeping secret until now."
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   Yes.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.080]   And it really-- and it's this architect-- is this technology that allows them to basically
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.360]   bridge two dies without having the-- they're making the point that it isn't as simple as
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:13.560]   saying, "Oh, we'll just have two-- basically two dies on the same module."
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.820]   But no, no, no, when you try to connect them together, the system sees them as two CPU--
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:22.480]   two different CPU units, and they're saying that developers have to be able to program
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.040]   for that, and basically, it fakes-- to all software including the OS, it thinks that it's
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.040]   one big CPU.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.120]   And they're also talking about how quickly it communicates with each other.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.920]   So that was a very, very technical and very, very impressive hunk.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.440]   I think for the developers who listened to Apple during WWDC and started programming
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.000]   to Metal a while ago, Apple kept on saying, "You really--"
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.280]   When they released Metal, they were like, "You really want to write to the stopwriting directly
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.280]   to the hardware.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.400]   You really want to use Metal, and now you can see why."
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.800]   Because for them, this is seamless.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:01.240]   For the developers that have written a lot of hard code to the Metal-- not to Metal,
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:06.040]   but to the hardware, they're having a lot of trouble getting, basically, unwriting everything
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.000]   to get it to work.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.560]   So he did kind of mention that.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.440]   This doesn't require any specialized programming chops.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.680]   If you wrote to Metal.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.400]   If you wrote to Metal, right.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.400]   Right.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.400]   Right.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.640]   But that's really where Apple-- and they even said that.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:25.440]   They said, "Look, the tight integration between Mac OS and our hardware makes a big difference,
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.080]   and I think that's true.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.680]   The hardware is written for Mac OS or designed for Mac OS.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.320]   It's a swift machine."
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.120]   Here's John Syracuse's post.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.120]   He tweeted this.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.360]   The dies.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:43.440]   He calls them the J.C. dies, building blocks for the Pro Mac SOCs.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:49.480]   And that actually is a good-- as you can see, a good-- there's the M1, M1 Pro, M1
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:57.080]   Max, and then two of them side by side to make the J2C die, which is basically-- somebody
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:01.480]   suggested you call it the M1 Max Quadra or M1 Max Duo, but it's really the M1 Max--
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.760]   one monoltra, which--
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.560]   Well, also, there's some bad mojo with the terminology that they didn't want to do.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.200]   Duo and Quadra, yeah, you probably don't want to go with that.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.840]   By the way, I just posted all the four feature quilts on my Twitter--
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   Thank you.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.840]   --the feature quilts.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.840]   Is that what you call those?
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.560]   That's what I've always called them.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.560]   I love it.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.040]   They're feature quilts.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   Good.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.120]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.520]   I appreciate it.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.880]   And for everybody who follows Andy on Twitter, that's it.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.480]   Someone should make a quilt.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.480]   That's what it's--
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   That could be Etsy.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   Etsy challenge extended.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.480]   That's what a good idea.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.080]   Oh, look at this.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.080]   Thank you, Andy.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.560]   That's fantastic.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.280]   So let's see.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.840]   So they announced-- OK.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.120]   We now have the Ultra.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.520]   So now we're going, oh, interesting.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.960]   What do you do with that?
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.960]   And instead--
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.960]   You give it all the RAM.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:54.960]   You give it all the RAM.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.160]   Instead of announcing a mini, they announced something called the Mac Studio.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.160]   It was interesting.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.640]   The rumor mill started talking about a Mac Studio.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.360]   John Mark Riven started tweeting it yesterday.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.120]   And I think what happens-- I've expected this-- as you get closer to the event, hundreds
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.160]   of people are involved in this production, right?
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.600]   Any outside contractors, somebody's going to say something.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.360]   I think they should-- they could have called it the extruded-man.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.800]   Yeah, it looks like a little bit of a fat cell.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   It's like a mini.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   And then we just hit extruded-
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.360]   It's a little fat cell.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:37.800]   But so what I took away from this is, no iMac Pro.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.520]   You don't need an iMac Pro.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.560]   Wouldn't it be better-- and I've thought this for a while-- if you had a standalone
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.320]   monitor and a standalone Mac mini-ish Mac that you could then stack and, in fact, the
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:54.560]   new stand for the monitor has a little table for you to put your fat cell on.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.440]   Well, and the thing is, the timing for this is perfect for me because I was just like
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.640]   my iMac that I'm talking to right now is 2017.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   I've been waiting for--
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   Yes.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.560]   You know, every time I go, is it time to get a new iMac?
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.920]   And about two months ago, I was like, I'm not getting a new iMac.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   I was waiting for this Mac mini.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.920]   Me too.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.040]   I was like, because I want to be able to route different things into this monitor.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.760]   I want to be able to do whatever I want it to be.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.760]   I want my own display.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.360]   I want to put my computer somewhere else.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.640]   No, I had exactly that thought.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   And that's the other thing.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.000]   If you don't like the fat cell, you don't have to put it under the monitor.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.880]   You could put it somewhere else.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.560]   So let's start talking about the Mac studio.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.440]   I think this is-- so just before we do, though, I think it's fair to say there will
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.960]   not be a high-end Mac mini.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.720]   That's what this is by another name.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.520]   There will not be an iMac Pro.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:55.240]   You spent $5,000, Alex, as did I, at least, for that iMac Pro, that 2017 iMac Pro.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:02.080]   And in every respect, you combine this, even the low-end Mac studio with the new studio
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:09.800]   monitor, you're going to spend $500 less, at least, and get something that's more than
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   twice as fast.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:15.120]   There's no question this is a more than ample replacement for the mini.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.040]   I mean the iMac Pro.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.200]   I'll say you have to wonder why someone who wants this kind of performance would want
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.280]   an all-in-one to begin with.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.160]   That's why the Mac Pro was a little bit of a weird outlier.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.960]   I always thought that-- I never got confirmation on this, even off the record.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.400]   But I always thought that the iMac Pro was always a desperation move.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:48.160]   This is that the Quaker-Oats box, some of the cylinder tower of Mac Pro was laid such
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.920]   an egg, was such a dud.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:55.280]   They had to get something out there that was going to give customers, creators, the performance
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:01.200]   that they needed, and not encourage them to jump ship and go off to windows.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:08.320]   Because the idea of Apple designing something that has two immense fans, immense blowers,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:15.240]   putting this huge hump on the back of an iMac, that's not the sort of thing that they would
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.040]   have wanted to do if their previous Mac Pro had been a success.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:24.800]   So we're asked when you take a look at an all-in-one M1 Mac that's super-- iMac that's
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.640]   super, super powerful, but it's slim, comes in lots of cool colors.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.720]   It's the thing that you buy for all the little desktops in your office for the people who
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.600]   don't necessarily need high performance.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.440]   It's cool, it's fun, you like it.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.960]   That's exactly what an iMac should be.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.840]   I think that's what it's always supposed to be.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.400]   They did an interesting thing with these new chips.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:51.400]   A lot of performance cores and only a couple of efficiency cores, it became very clear when
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:58.360]   they started talking about this that what they're going to do here is make a plug-in
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.160]   computer.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:08.320]   So you have, I wrote it down, 16 performance cores in the 20-core CPU and four efficiency
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.320]   cores.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.920]   There's not a lot of efficiency cores.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.440]   This is not the half and half you see on an iPhone because this is a plug-in device.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.240]   And as a result, the other thing they immediately focused on, and I had kind of shades of Johnny
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.160]   Ive here, is the holes.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.360]   The first thing I saw, I thought, "Oh my God, is this a cheese grater?"
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.520]   Because they show the holes on the bottom and suddenly we see when we see the model
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.400]   that there is a lot of cooling.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:37.200]   In fact, half of the fat boy, the top half is fans.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   Yep.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.560]   They felt the need to make sure they say that we think that even at the highest level of
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.480]   performance, you'll barely be able to hear it.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.200]   And so you can hear that they're a little bit something that they can, they get a pass
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:53.280]   for delivering performance and not caring that this thing is absolutely deadly panther
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.320]   in the jungle quiet.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:00.360]   But you can tell they're a little, "Oh, we wish this were quiet."
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.920]   But yeah, they made a big, I think that also they're occurring from previous problems that
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.920]   they were having, selling high performance machines that had faulty cooling.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.640]   And they wanted to make it really, really, really certain that look how big our fans
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:17.360]   are, look how much we thought about the flow of air through this thing about how it not
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.240]   only, it's shaped and it's distinctive.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.520]   I wonder how that will affect, I wonder if it still works that way if you have it on its
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.480]   side, because I think that a lot of people are not going to pay attention to the clear
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.760]   design cues that says that this is supposed to be on its base.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.480]   A lot of people are going to try to turn it on its side.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.180]   I don't want to put it under my desk.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.720]   I don't want to even put it underneath the monitor.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.800]   So here's the, "Thank you to Evil IRC in our chatroom who found this."
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.560]   This is actually from the Apple Store or the Apple page describing it.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.760]   This is the, these are the stacked processes.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:49.760]   Processes.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.760]   That's a, you said, "Use it."
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.240]   You said, "Use the word," and I think it's appropriate, "Alex," "a flex."
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.400]   That is a, that's like, you want two of them?
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.400]   Sure.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.320]   And the way that they're putting them together, again, this was impossible with Intel.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.080]   So what they're doing now is they're able to, they're kind of unleashed.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.520]   And the thing that has got to be scary to a lot, everybody else, is that you have a company
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.600]   with the money to do anything when they're unleashed and now they're unleashed.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.200]   So this is the elephant, this is the angry elephant that's three times bigger than you expected
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.200]   and runs like a cheetah.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.920]   You know, like, you know, and that's a, that's a scary place to be if you're an industry.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.000]   I imagine Intel's been working on their interconnects, right?
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.940]   Yeah, but the problem is is that how do you do this when, the problem is is that you need
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.280]   control of the whole board.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.200]   Like this is, this is what Apple can do and that's why it's so hard for the rest of the
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.200]   industry.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.480]   You can get the chips to be a little bit faster and so on and so forth, but can you control
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:49.560]   the entire IO to take advantage of it?
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:45:00.680]   So the very first product they talked about running on these new ultra chips is the M1,
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:07.400]   I'm sorry, the studio, the Mac studio with the M1 Max.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:13.240]   M1 Max and yeah, the 2000, the cheap one is the M1 Max.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.720]   The expensive one has the M1 Ultra and it's a different price difference of what double
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:24.440]   $2,000 starting price in the M1 Max and I think 4,000 on the M1 Ultra, which maybe
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.640]   talking Lisa down a couple of days ago, I said, yeah, they're probably going to announce
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.640]   a mini.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   It may not have a max in it.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.280]   It may just be a pro in it.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.880]   I was exactly wrong.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.880]   This is this.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.720]   So the one with the Max is actually in a way, the mini that you saw you were going to get,
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.720]   right?
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   Right.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.720]   Right.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.720]   The higher end of that.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:52.600]   Yeah, but 2000 is what I paid for my base model MacBook Pro 14 inch with the M1 Pro.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.560]   So you're getting more in some ways, right?
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:02.320]   You're getting a lot of power, a lot of horsepower, 64 gigs of unified memory.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.640]   That by the way, well, we're going to get to the graphics card conversation, but put
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:14.080]   a pin in that unified memory member 128 gigs of unified memory on the M1 Ultra, 400 gigabytes
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:19.200]   per second memory bandwidth on the max, 800 gigabytes per second memory bandwidth on
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.200]   the Ultra.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:25.320]   And the SSDs are extremely fast on these.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.920]   So this is a beast.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   This is a beast.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.800]   They also they led this off with, I think, the right line that I had to go back and make
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.400]   sure I noted correctly.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.000]   So they basically led this off by saying the theme of this machine was performance, connectivity,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   modularity.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.920]   So they covered the performance with the CPUs, but they really delivered on connectivity.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.680]   Given that given that the complaints, of course, about the Mac mini were that it is essentially
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.920]   the MacBook Air chip inside a Mac mini, you can get two displays.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.200]   That's about it.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:02.000]   The idea that you can have like what five simultaneously supporting five displays.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.200]   One thing I was I was a little bit confused by was there's sometimes in the specs when
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.240]   they were talking, I've got confused about is there's future.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.840]   Is there connectivity and features that are exclusive to the M1 Ultra because it has two
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.680]   separate dies and therefore twice the pipes?
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:22.000]   But the short of is the back has T4 for Thunderbolt 4 ports.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.760]   The front has USB-C ports on the max and on the Ultra it has their all Thunderbolt 4.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.960]   So there's a few little differences like that.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.520]   I'm looking at the tech specs where they have the two side by side and under video support,
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.720]   they don't break that into two different columns.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:42.280]   So that says simultaneously supports up to five displays support for up to four pro
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:47.520]   display XDRs over USB-C and one display 4K over HDMI.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.000]   That was quite a flex too, where she said and you can have a big TV.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.800]   And of course that's for video editors who do want that display, but also the their monitors.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   I was a little disappointed.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:02.760]   So was Anthony Nielsen to hear only 60 Hertz, not a higher refresh rate.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   Does that bother you Alex?
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.760]   Does that matter?
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.600]   It's only for gamers care.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.800]   Gamers care for now.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:14.040]   And I think that it is, you know, a lot of us are paying a lot of attention to high frame
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.040]   rate.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.840]   And so I think that for the most part is probably fine.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.640]   I mean, most people aren't going to use it that way.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.760]   But you're seeing most things going to 120 Hertz.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:27.480]   And the PC side is a little on you and a lot even in laptops.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.000]   This I love.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.680]   So Apple as usual showed their weird graphs with no, no zero origin and no, no, no.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.120]   But on the website, they do have some benchmarks, which actually are great.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.320]   So this is the CPU performance.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:49.600]   And they're comparing a ultra max, the Mac Pro with the 16 core Xeon and the 27 inch
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.400]   iMac 10 core i9.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.600]   I think that's the pro.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.960]   And then you can click different things.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:02.280]   So this is NASA's Tetris is 5.3 times faster.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.760]   Houdini.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.400]   But you see these graphs.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.840]   It looks by the way, on Houdini, not much difference to the Mac Pro with Xeon and the
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.600]   Mac M1 Mac's Mac Studio.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.280]   But a big difference.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.000]   And it just depends on how they're using the data.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.240]   I mean, it's really, really complex.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   What are they doing with Houdini?
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.640]   Photoshop, some big performance improvements.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.000]   They're vector works.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.680]   I think a lot of Mac folks might want to know how affinity photo performs because it's written
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:40.920]   for probably in Swift for Mac is very much tuned to it.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.600]   There isn't a huge difference in the ultra and the Macs.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   There.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:51.000]   But you notice that most of the time, at least during the presentation, when they were comparing
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.880]   how much faster the new was to the old, they were comparing Mac based the studios based
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.440]   on Macs to the fastest iMac Pro.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.080]   They're comparing the ultra to the fastest Mac Pro.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.080]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   Yes.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:08.520]   So they're clearly making a difference between people who are going to spend extra $2,000.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:15.920]   So there, I mean, look, I own a significant portion of the Intel lineup.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.320]   Is there any reason to keep any of that, Alex?
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.840]   Well, it depends on what you're using.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.520]   I mean, I think that for, I mean, you can always, I use computers until they die.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.080]   So there's always things to do with them.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:30.720]   You know, I have this, you know, this tellestrator is running on like a 2012 Mac mini.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.720]   Because it's funny.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.720]   That's what it needs to do.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.720]   But that's all it needs to do.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.400]   You know, and so, so I think that there's, I have plenty of Mac minis and laptops that
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:43.240]   I keep on using for other things, sometimes just to run old operating systems so that
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.040]   I can still get the things.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.760]   So I think that those things are useful.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   I think that I'm glad that I switched to the M1, you know, when it came out so that we
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   bought a lot of those.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   Actually, I said half fans.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.160]   It looks like it's a little more like a two thirds fan.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.160]   It's pretty exciting.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:08.240]   I mean, it's, it is by the way exactly the same footprint size as the Mac mini.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.120]   So it really is an extruded Mac mini.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.760]   It's not quite twice as all.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:16.400]   It's not, we actually put two Mac minis together to simulate it.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.400]   It's not quite that tall.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.840]   3.7 inches tall.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.120]   7.7 inches square.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.880]   It's, you know, as with any new footprint, it's going to look a little weird at first
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.520]   and you'll get used to it.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.400]   Some people have compared it to the cube in some ways.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.480]   Maybe we said that.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.000]   We said that during office hours, after hours.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.360]   That's, I wonder if that's another sign of the difference between that we're in definitely
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:47.400]   a new post Johnny I've aged of Apple where they didn't even consider less just, let's
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:51.640]   just refab the case and make it a little bit more interesting, put the, put a grill in
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:57.240]   the front, put some perforations do whatever they just simply, as Alex said, open up the,
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.560]   open up the cat app, extrude another two inches.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:01.560]   We'll ship it.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   Exactly.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.560]   Which is, which is great.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   Like ship it.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   It's efficient.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.880]   All they, they, they, they looks like all they did was say, here's how much room we're
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.960]   going to need for the fans, add more room for the fans, put some holes in the front.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:18.240]   That's, that's, that's another thing for understanding that people, people who are going to be using SD cards
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.920]   might want to actually insert them into the machine.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   Let's not have them around the back of a 27 and 27.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.920]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   Right.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   Mac display.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   It's like, no, but this is, we're, we're intending for people to actually use these.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.280]   I always forget there's an SD card slot on my Mac Pro.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.280]   Always.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.960]   But it's right there on the front where it belongs, along with two USB C type ports, either thunderbolt
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.520]   for USB C, depending on the model you can go.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.760]   And some of the, and some of the other things that, you know, like the OWC makes those little
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.320]   base that has an extra drive.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.320]   Oh, and it'll fit on that.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   It'll just sit, it'll sit theoretically.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.560]   I mean, I don't know if it messes up the, the airflow, but it shouldn't because it's designed
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.560]   to work with a Mac mini.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:57.920]   You know what this does, by the way, all those stupid renders you might have seen with plexiglass
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.920]   tops and stuff.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:52:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.680]   No, that's not what we did.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   You were wrong.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   You guys were wrong.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.680]   Those are all made up.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.520]   And remember when they're shipping this, like when you think about how good Apple is
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:13.720]   at keeping a secret, this was done, you know, this probably done a year ago, maybe two years
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:17.240]   ago, you know, like it, you know, because, because it, you know, to have it shipping means
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:22.360]   that millions have already been made, you know, so it's not, you know, it's, it's a,
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.640]   and that had to be fabbed that had to be, you know, like everything.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.680]   So it's, it's a, you know, at least six months, probably a year and a half ago is when they
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.440]   thought of this or when they connected.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.840]   There's the cooling video that they have on the, on the website.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.840]   So it draws in from below.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.160]   And then the fans have a kind of little L turn on them.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.480]   And so it's, it's pulling it up from below and then pushing it out the back where there
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.160]   is a big grid on the back.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.920]   And by the way, that size.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   Go ahead.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.920]   Go ahead.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:56.000]   So fans, this powerful, I'm wondering how hard it's going to be to open that up and clean
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.960]   those fans because that's going to be a dust man.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   A lot of, a lot of stuff.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.960]   And that's, that's periodic maintenance that you have to do unless you're living in a clean
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.960]   room.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.120]   Scooter says those are blowers, not fans.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   Okay.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   Blowers.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:15.080]   And by the way, the size of those greatly affects the amount of sound they make.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.640]   So you want to make it a lot bigger.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.280]   It's going to be a lot, a lot quieter.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.840]   They can operate a slower RPM.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:27.880]   I wonder if Johnny, I've, what he would say about the grid, the grill.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.120]   It's not, it ain't a cheese grater.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:35.880]   It does look like though, there's some interesting stuff done below with the curves and the geometry
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.880]   of that.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:41.680]   It's okay to, you know, it's okay to have a boring aluminum on the corner box.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:47.240]   Again, we're not, again, we, we've seen that we've seen the, the, the Quaker Road's box
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:52.000]   machine that looked beautiful as a static object that you don't have to actually run
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   any software on.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.800]   It was a lovely thing to regard academically.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.200]   But the thing is that that, that impresses you for three days and then you're wondering
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.400]   why the thing can't cool.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:04.920]   It's, it's, is, is thermally throttling because you don't have, you need it to have active
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:09.600]   cooling and you lost the argument about how if we have an actual fan owner, no, the fan
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.560]   would actually cause noise.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.760]   We can't have noise here.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:18.240]   We, I love the idea of Apple returning to, we can do stylish, but we'll, we're not going
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:22.240]   to make, we're not going to make that get in the way of having a successful product
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.880]   that people are going to get five or six years of happy use out of.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.280]   Are you sad, Alex?
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   No, MagSafe.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.040]   It's got the Mickey Mouse plug in.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.720]   And I don't care about it.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.720]   Not, not for the Mac mini.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.560]   I mean, I don't want a MagSafe actually for a Mac mini because I don't want to be pulling
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.320]   cables around and having it pop out.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:40.560]   It's for the laptop when I have a battery that I want a MagSafe.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.760]   But for this, I would want to plug in.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:48.800]   I'm a little bum, I mean, the Mickey Mouse, we call it the Mickey Mouse connector, is,
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.480]   I'm going to look at another connector I have to manage because it's really nice when it's
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.000]   a figure eight or a C-13.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.720]   So this is a non-standard, it's not non-standard, but it may, well, it depends on the scale
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:00.720]   of it.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.920]   It's just not as, you don't have as many of them lay around.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.720]   Well, it gives it a ground.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:06.720]   Is that why?
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.720]   Okay.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:12.920]   Mac mini currently has in the Apple TV, which are both the same, are a standard, I think,
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:14.400]   they're C7s.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:18.680]   And those C7s are, they don't carry a ground with them.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:23.400]   So you can feel it sometimes, you know, if you're connected to it, but if you're ground,
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.560]   if you become the ground, but the, but this one, yeah, adding the ground is going to be
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.600]   more, still though a power brick, right?
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.160]   The power supply is not inside this or is it?
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.160]   It is.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.160]   Yeah, that's a, yeah, that's that connector.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.160]   That's the internal power supply.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.160]   That's interesting.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.880]   It seems like a mistake.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.200]   You're bringing a lot of heat back into the case.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.800]   Yeah, but it's a lot better.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:48.440]   I mean, power, power supply is sitting outside or, you know, that that's much harder to replace.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   You know, when you need it, when something goes wrong and it's actually not harder to replace
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:57.800]   if you burn it up, but it's, but it's harder to replace, you know, this one, that, I think
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:02.880]   that that, that, that, that plug is going to be the standard plug that we can, that we
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.440]   can go buy at the hardware store.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:13.800]   And on the back, very nice as one hoped, selection of ports, including four Thunderbolt four ports,
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.520]   a 10 gigabit ethernet.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:19.120]   Is that enough for you, Alex?
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:22.480]   I think it's a, there's never, it's never enough.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.120]   So it's enough for me.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:28.480]   I will fill that up pretty, within the first two days, you know, the, the, the advantage
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.800]   though is that with, because those are all thunderbolts on the back, you know, of course,
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.880]   I can thunderbolt into something else that'll expand one even further.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:41.120]   So I, for instance, didn't buy, I bought a terabyte hard drive, not a four terabyte or
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.120]   even eight.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.120]   Yeah, we do.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.880]   Because I'll be putting external stuff on there anyway.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.360]   Two USB A ports, which is nice to have.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.760]   It's really nice to have some point, you know, like it's nice to have a couple of.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:55.680]   There's still some legacy, you know, you got a thumb drive and stuff.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.880]   HDMI, which is nice.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:04.600]   They mentioned that those four type C ports can drive display port, but the HDMI is nice.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.040]   So that's pretty flexible, I guess.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.040]   You know, it's, it's great to have an HDMI cable.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.400]   I mean, it just, it would be one of the USB Cs, one of the thunderbolt or USB Cs for you,
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.400]   if it wasn't there.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.960]   And so, and it's dedicated.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.960]   You know that it's there.
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.600]   You don't need an adapter because you're going to need to plug it into something.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   Right.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.600]   You don't need an adapter.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:28.040]   I mean, you've got six type C ports on this thing.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.920]   So there's, there's plenty of places.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.080]   And even then you may have, I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.120]   I'm probably going to have a dock for extra.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:40.400]   This is, this is definitely like Scrooge on Christmas morning versus Scrooge on Christmas
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.400]   eve.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.960]   That's like, they, they, they, they've seen the lights.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.960]   Everybody gets ports.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.640]   Oh no, you don't have to use up one of the thunderbolt ports for, for HDMI.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.280]   Why don't we give you an extra one?
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:56.480]   It's, and especially on a, on a $4,000 machine where they could say, well, look, I mean,
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.880]   not that we're going to, not that we don't think that money is money, but hey, buy a
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:03.640]   Cal digit box for 300 bucks and we'll give you one extra ports for that kind of stuff.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.260]   We're just going to give you thunderbolts and you can do whatever you want with each
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.260]   one of them.
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:08.260]   Right.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:11.520]   I was so, that, that's so not what I would have expected from Apple four years ago, five
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:12.520]   years ago.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.440]   Yeah, I'm back-ordered on the Cal digit, but that's exactly what you'd want that thunderbolt
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.680]   for a Cal digit.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:22.320]   The SDXC is the faster SD card, right?
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.080]   That's, you, you, you, you missed the headphone jack.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.480]   Oh, I didn't, I left out the most important.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.520]   We, we, we, on office hours, we're, because we were, you know, everyone was watching
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.520]   together.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.120]   There's like 150 people watching in zoom and, and, and the, we all laughed about it.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.960]   Cause they were, they, they built up that.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.400]   I've never seen anyone build up a headphone jack like that.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:43.440]   The professional audio, you know, you could drive heads for a high, high impedance head
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.440]   for a stereo.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.440]   Does it do high impedance is not high impedance.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:51.440]   It's, it's, they said, they said high impedance high impedance.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.080]   So they've got a nice lamp amp in there.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   Sure.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.120]   So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so.
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.840]   I've never seen a headphone jack built up so heavily, the, the, not one little set of
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.840]   signals.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.840]   So, do you, do you, do you see the little signals out here?
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.840]   I don't understand why it's on the back, to be honest.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.640]   Okay, but, but, but I want to get back to feeling singled out for like abuse here.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:16.040]   That no, no, Andy, we couldn't put one on the, on your iPad on your iPad.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040]   You couldn't put one one on your phone.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.040]   We decided that.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.040]   So.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:24.520]   So I guess the reason it's on the back is cause most people will be driving powered speakers
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.520]   with it.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.520]   And that's, I mean, that's what I will be doing.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520]   I guess.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.520]   But weird anyway.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.520]   That's a weird part.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.520]   That's a little weird.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.520]   Like it's all I'm saying.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.040]   They could have put an optical port on there.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   On the front would have been nice.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.040]   On the front would have been nice optical on the back.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.040]   Okay.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.280]   Let's be, we're being nitpicky at this point.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.440]   Well, no, but yeah.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.440]   And, and also thunderbolt if you want to, if you want that kind of, like, that's right,
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.440]   that's right.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.440]   Dac or if you want something like that, plug it in.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.440]   That's right.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.440]   You got it.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.440]   But.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:54.200]   I used for that.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.480]   Okay, let's take another break.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:02.960]   I really do want to talk about power, you know, and it's particularly about GPU because
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:09.720]   that's, if there's one area where professionals are going to say, but I need CUDA cores is,
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.080]   you know, it's going to be in the GPU.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.960]   So let's, we'll talk a little bit about that in just a second.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:22.080]   And the Enoco and Mr. Alex Lindsey here with us, Renee is on assignment.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.960]   He'll be back.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.440]   Check his Instagram to see if he's on a plane.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.440]   That's curious.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.400]   By the way, here from scooter X, the actual quote, the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack in
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.400]   the Mac book.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.920]   Oh no, that's the Macbook Pro.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:44.680]   Oh, you gave me the Macbook Pro DC load detection and adaptive voltage output.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.760]   Your Mac could detect the impedance of the connected device.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.760]   Hmm.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:55.560]   Well, I guess that's, I guess that's also going to be a be something like that in the Mac studio.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.560]   It's going to be at least that good.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.960]   Are showed today brought to you by better help.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.560]   Relationships take work.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.880]   A lot of us will drop anything that goes help someone we care about, right?
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:13.320]   We'll go out of our way to treat other people well, but how often you treat yourself that
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   well.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.080]   You're going to be able to be happy.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.920]   This month better help online therapy wants to remind you to take care of your most important
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.840]   relationship, the one you have with yourself.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:31.240]   Um, whether it's hitting the gym, it's making time for a haircut or a massage or even, I
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.640]   don't know, trying therapy.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.000]   You're your greatest asset.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.320]   Invest the time and effort into yourself as you do for other people.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:46.400]   Better help is the better way to do therapy online video, phone, live chat sessions with
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.560]   your therapist.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.520]   You don't have to see somebody on camera or you don't have to be on camera if you don't
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.720]   want to.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:57.880]   So in a way, it's kind of, uh, it's kind of even more relaxing, more reassuring.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:01.280]   And I can tell you there is no shame in getting therapy.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.560]   This is, this is all about you, you know, you get your nails done, you get your hair
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:13.320]   did, you go out to the gym and you work out, do a little something for your brain, for
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.360]   your, for yourself.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.440]   Better help is online therapy, much more affordable than an in person therapy.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.920]   Uh, they'll, it's not crazy.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   I want it to be clear.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.320]   It's not crisis therapy.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.160]   Uh, but, but you can be matched with the therapist under 48 hours.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.920]   You certainly don't have to suffer.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.000]   Uh, give it a try.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.360]   See why over two million people now have used better help online therapy.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.160]   Uh, really is a great solution.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.800]   Uh, bringing therapy to where you are.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.800]   And they make it very easy, by the way, to change therapists, to find a therapist that's
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800]   right for you.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.240]   You say, why would I want to check?
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.440]   Well, you know, every therapist is difference and, uh, and you should have somebody that
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:59.200]   fits your, uh, style, your personality is going to work with you the way you want to.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.200]   That's the other thing.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.200]   They do a lot of different modalities.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.520]   Really, it's the best way why limit yourself to the, the therapists that are within, you
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:10.960]   know, driving distance of your house when you can have therapists all over the country.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.560]   Uh, one of whom is exactly right for you.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.760]   I'm a big fan for this.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.200]   They make it so easy.

[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.440]   They do have couples therapy by the way.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.680]   If you want to, if you want to work on your relationship, you can.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.360]   I don't want to imply that you can't.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.360]   You can do that.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.160]   You're going to yourself or your relationship.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:52.360]   Uh, they also have a teen therapist, you know, especially because we've been in quarantine
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.360]   for two years.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.520]   It's been really hard on kids, really hard on kids.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.440]   Uh, you know, high school is not the same as we grew up with.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.500]   And I think a lot of teens are struggling a little bit.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.360]   This is a great way and it's kind of non-intrusive way that they're very, they'll be comfortable
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.360]   with.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.360]   They live on the phone, right?
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.040]   Uh, to get some support for your teen.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.800]   So think about it for that as well.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.160]   Better help.com/macbreak.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.040]   10% off your first month.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:26.320]   Really happy to have these guys on our, on our network because it's a very, very, very
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.320]   important thing.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320]   Uh, alright.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.240]   We haven't even gotten to the display yet.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:37.840]   We'll get to the display in a second, but I do want to talk about GPUs because, you know,
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:43.560]   they spent a lot of time talking about how great these GPUs are compared even, uh, the,
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.280]   to the radiance that they put in the top of the line Mac Pros.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.400]   Notice there was no Nvidia mention at all.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:55.280]   Um, and Alex, you're the, you know, I always go to you to ask you about this because you,
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.280]   you're the pro user.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.280]   You're the high end user.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.280]   You understand what pros want.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.420]   And of course you had 150 people in office hours watching this together.
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.420]   What was the reaction?
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:06.000]   What is the feeling about the GPUs?
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   People pretty excited.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.640]   To say at least, you know, I think that so that not everything is the GPU.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.200]   A lot of it is the processing, the number of processors and how they handle it and how
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.920]   they, whether they can do it in parallel and so on and so forth.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.240]   But, um, on the other side of that, uh, ram is a big deal.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:28.040]   And here's why ram is a big deal is because it means you could hold larger texture maps
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:32.440]   and you can hold larger models in the ram while you're processing.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.960]   So by having more, more memory available to the GPU, it means that those, you have much,
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.800]   so much larger, um, texture maps that means that everything looks higher resolution than
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.800]   it did before.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.040]   Um, so it may not, again, it may not be able to process as fast sometimes.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.920]   And so that might affect handle effects and so on and so forth.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:54.960]   But the amount of raw amount of resources.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:59.560]   So I can have 4K texture maps instead of 2K texture maps or 8K texture maps instead of
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.560]   4K.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.280]   You know, those kinds of things I can start throwing much, much larger imagery and much,
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.280]   much larger models.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.600]   It also means, um, I can do things like oversampling.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:15.360]   So oversampling is I know you need a 4K image, but I'm going to render a 16K image and then
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.240]   I'm going to bring it back down to four.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.400]   And what that does is it handles all the little aliasing, all the little jagged edges
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.200]   along the edge of the model.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.320]   And so those are the kind of things that you can do when you have a lot of RAM.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.480]   128 gigs on the ultra.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.480]   Um, boom.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.440]   No, I don't think that's, I mean, that's only the very highest end GPUs would have anything
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.440]   near that kind of.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.920]   I've never seen a GPU with that much RAM.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.920]   No.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   Okay.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920]   I think it's 48.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920]   I think 48 is the most I've ever seen.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.920]   But it's different.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.640]   Again, this is a different architecture because you now have rarely do both the GPU and the
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.080]   CPU need all that RAM at one time.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.760]   It's usually, it's oftentimes left kind of latent.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:56.560]   So being able to share the shared memory architecture is incredibly important in this
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.560]   process.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.280]   800 gigabytes per second memory bandwidth.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.120]   Is that a good number?
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.120]   It's fast.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.960]   I don't know.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.000]   I actually, I don't have a reference point for that.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.800]   It's really hard.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.200]   I don't, I don't know what the, I don't know what my current one is.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.200]   I don't know what those ones are.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.200]   That's not, that's not a number.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.200]   I know.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   60 up to 64 core GPU.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.160]   That's a lot.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.080]   No, they're not CUDA cores.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.640]   You don't get ray hardware ray tracing.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.400]   There are people who need that kind of stuff, right?
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.400]   And you don't get on real engine.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.440]   Like not, not doing any like, like the ray tracing thing is cool, but it's not like,
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:35.440]   you know, I did, anyway, I did a big, big, shiny ship.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.960]   I did a big shiny ship for a, for a space film without ray tracing.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.960]   So I got, I got like, but that was a long time.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.960]   It looks great.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.840]   But what's more interesting is when, when they start saying we can handle global
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.360]   illumination or physically based rendering in real time or something like that, now you
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.400]   have my attention ray tracing is, is, is hard.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.280]   And I'm glad that they're able to do it.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.720]   But it's the, it's the global illumination stuff that is going to require a lot of RAM.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720]   Right.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.720]   No, to figure out.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.720]   Right.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.720]   And you can do ray tracing in software.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.680]   And in fact, somebody's saying, uh, uh, dwindle saying his blender cycle rendered as
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:14.560]   a pretty good job on the M1 Max, but it's still faster on my 2080 Ti maybe.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.360]   But now let's see what the ultra.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   And it'll be interesting.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.880]   I mean, I'm less, I'm less worried about real time and more, cause you can get, there's
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:24.480]   not many games or even anything real time that really takes advantage of most of these,
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.480]   most of this hardware.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.440]   What I'm really interested in is to see how the cinema 4D, right, you know, do this.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.840]   How does motion handle this?
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:34.680]   How does, you know, those types of things, you know, handle the processors there?
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:43.800]   It's sad to say, but it's the case that, um, Mac is not a gaming platform.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.440]   Yeah, I mean, there's, it's, it's a nice footnote to talk about.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.880]   But the thing is anybody who wants casual gamers have their needs well covered by other
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.120]   Apple products, people who are very, very serious gamers who are going to be bemoan
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:00.440]   the fact that, ooh, 60 Hertz, that's not, that's a, that's a terrible limit.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.320]   Their role there, they're not going to be interested in Max to begin with for reasons
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.160]   that go beyond, uh, having an M1, uh, M1 ultra processor in there.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.960]   So I don't think that's a big deal.
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.080]   I think that what they're, I'm just saying, I think, I think that the, the needs for the
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:25.640]   studio were, uh, that really huge, rich vein of customers between entry level, basic productivity,
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:31.320]   Max, and super, super graphic chunking, number chunking, uh, Mac pros.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.880]   We're talking about like the people who are creating videos on YouTube, make, who have
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.120]   their own studio will look, uh, producing digital videos who need that kind of power,
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:44.280]   don't necessarily need to spend, uh, need the kind of power they need to spend $6,000
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.280]   for it.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.000]   And I think that this is where they've, they've aimed these two, uh, processors on these,
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.300]   the versions of these studio.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:55.840]   And there's an Apple could become a big player in real time games because I think there's
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:01.240]   a real blind spot in the gaming community, which is they don't really have a broadcastable
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.240]   solution.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:06.720]   They have a solution that gamers like to watch and they can fill a stadium once every
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.960]   once in a while with the gamers, but then they're not really hitting the mark on building
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.480]   a truly broadcastable game.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.320]   And until someone does that, Apple, Apple could, you know, step into that market pretty
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.840]   hard, you know, and that's a, you know, an integrated game that scales to all the way
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.760]   down to your iPhone and Apple TV and all the way up to a Mac pro and, um, broadcasts and
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.240]   is able to broadcast, then you throw a $10 million pot into it for the winner.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:34.520]   Things get real interesting real quick, you know, like, you know, and that's the, and
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.520]   that.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:40.080]   I'd love to see that if they got, yeah, but they have to backfill all the hardware first.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:44.080]   So I think that that this could be something they did any year or two after they have all
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.600]   of the stuff rolled out.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:50.360]   I think that we're looking at, I think they gave us a very clear map today of where their
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.160]   interests are and that kind of content.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:57.600]   They, we did gloss over the Apple TV plus section because it was meant to be because
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:03.520]   we were yawning over because, but also one thing that really, really struck me was that
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.640]   they didn't just, yes, yes, yes.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:12.760]   But the, well, if your eyes were open and you were taking notes like I was, like we
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:17.360]   were used to seeing, oh, look how, look how popular Ted Lasso is Ted Lasso, Ted Lasso,
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.600]   Ted Lasso, whatever the lowest, latest it is.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.200]   They really, really, I was, I was prepared to simply, Oh great.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.280]   I get in this section, I've got this montage of what they're doing with Apple TV content.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.800]   I get to spend the next, I didn't think that I'd have time to move this streaming window
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.800]   to this other display.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.920]   Now I have time to, to take notes.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.360]   But man, they really did a good job of cutting together a montage of content that shows this
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.440]   is not just, hey, look, we, we hired some people who used to be on Friends to do like
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.240]   a, at Andy's, to do a, a, a Sorkin style TV drama.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.680]   It's like, no, they said we have, here's the children's program.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.800]   We hear the people we hired away from Pixar.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.320]   Here are super, super high named actors that we have in serious dramas.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.560]   Here are comedies that we're doing.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.520]   Here are, they really are flexing the idea that they're creating themselves as a real
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.880]   studio.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:07.920]   And it demonstrates that if they wanted to be, I think that if they wanted to be a game
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.360]   studio like that, they certainly could be doing that, but they, I don't think that they want
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360]   to.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.880]   They're putting their money exactly where they want to go.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:22.760]   And as far as graphics performance, I think that they're also saying that we are, we feel
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:27.400]   that it's most important to, we want to make sure the content creators with our desktops
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.200]   have the tools they need to create the content that's going to be, that's going to be targeted
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.280]   at our devices.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:37.200]   But I think that the future of the company is more leading towards making sure that your
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.840]   handheld device has enough power to run this content.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:46.080]   Your wearable, future wearable device has enough CPU, GPU power to run this sort of stuff.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.320]   I think that they made a lot of their intentions known just below the surface of most of the
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.520]   announcements they made today.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:59.320]   Well, before we move on, can I just mention one question that I still had.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.480]   Like I said, when they introduced the section for the studio, they're mentioning here's
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.120]   what we wanted to accomplish, performance, connectivity, modularity.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.280]   So we, performance and connectivity are obvious.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:12.960]   I'm trying to, I'm still trying to work out what they meant by modularity.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.440]   And I'm hoping that they met it every time I think about, well, maybe they meant that
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:21.840]   you can hook up external displays to it, but that's more like a connectivity thing.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.400]   They stack nicely.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.400]   They do.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.160]   They're like GPU Legos.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.160]   Exactly.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:34.520]   I hope that that means that, I mean, this is a lost cause, but I hope that that means
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:39.640]   that it is possible to take this thing apart and service it routinely without having to
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.160]   basically do a, well, yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.160]   Your fan is making all that noise.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.400]   We can give you a brand new one for $1800 because I'm afraid this is all built on the
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.400]   same.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:55.720]   So we all, we 3D printed the fans, the motors, the power supply, the CPU, the GPU, the memory,
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.760]   all out of one block of stuff.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.160]   So we can't do any repairs that are a more than sending you a new one.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:07.240]   The one thing that I did notice when it comes to modularity as we were talking about that
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:15.600]   is that they, it, oh no, it's just too tall to be a two-u unit.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.600]   That's so sad.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.600]   You wanted to wrap it and hit it right.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.000]   And then I was like, I was like, they did it perfectly.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.200]   I thought it would be.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.720]   No, it's, it's literally by two, by two tenths of an inch.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.200]   Well, maybe you can shave it down or something.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.800]   Apple's like, what is to you?
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.600]   And I'm more like, I don't think you understand.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.920]   You know, I thought that's why they had the air coming out the back.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920]   I thought so too.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.200]   I looked at, I was like, oh, they, they hit this right on.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.560]   And then I looked at the one you, because I thought it was 1.9 that is the height of
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.800]   a one you, but it's actually 1.75.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.800]   One, one, one.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.680]   So anyway, here we go.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.680]   It's so sad.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.680]   Well, I love it.
[01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.800]   I love the fact that I went to go ahead.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.160]   I'd say, I love the fact that I had no idea what two you meant.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.960]   And then as soon as I heard like someone in the studio go, oh, like, oh boy, that's,
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:09.760]   that's a really important thing.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.760]   Whenever it was.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.760]   They didn't hit it.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.760]   Important.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.760]   So I think it's a really important thing.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.760]   I think it's a really important thing.

[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:17.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:19.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.760]   I think it's a really important thing.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.760]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.760]   Alex Lindsay's here.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.760]   Officehours.global, did you record that watching the event?
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.760]   Boy, I'd like to see the comments.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.760]   We didn't.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.760]   It was a...
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.760]   We don't record those.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:40.760]   After hours doesn't record, but I think by the end we were at 100.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.760]   Sorry, I got to stop coming up.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:45.760]   Because I would really...
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.760]   But of course I'm working, so I can't be in the office hours.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   But maybe next time we'll stream office hours and forget coming in and let you guys
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.760]   handle that.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   Because I would love to hear what all those pros and office hours have to say.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.760]   It is.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:03.760]   It's the geekiest water cooler in the world.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.760]   So having 150 people who are geeky watching it together and talking about it and everything.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.760]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:22.760]   I honestly think that while it's fun to watch, it's probably best not to do what I did and Alex did.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.760]   But to wait a week or two, let the dust settle.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.760]   Hear what possible negatives there are.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.760]   Maybe even see some reviews.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.760]   So we're not advocating that you do what you did.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.760]   We talked about it.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.760]   Yeah, no.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.760]   But it was just...
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.760]   It hit just the right spot for what I wanted.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.760]   You know, like in that...
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:43.760]   And frankly, I ordered that quickly because we're trying to get review...
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:44.760]   We don't do review units from Apple.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   We try to buy them and we wanted to get them in as soon as possible so we can talk about
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.760]   them and I'll let you know.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.760]   The last ship date I saw was a week from Friday.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:58.760]   So we'll do an unboxing on Friday afternoon.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:04.760]   Our show today brought to you by New Relic.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:05.760]   You've been there.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.760]   We've all been there.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:14.760]   If your software engineer and network administrator sits up, you're nice and cozy in bed, fast asleep, snoring away.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.760]   The phone rings.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.760]   Something's wrong.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:18.760]   Something's broken.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.760]   The network's down.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.760]   The software's not running.
[01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:31.760]   And of course, your heart starts pounding your minds, racing your jumping out of bed in the middle of the night.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.760]   What could be wrong?
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   And that's the problem.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:35.760]   What could be wrong?
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.760]   You don't know.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:37.760]   Is it the back end?
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.760]   Is it the front end?
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.760]   Is it the...
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.760]   A global problem?
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.760]   Is it a local problem?
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760]   Is it your server?
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.760]   Is it the network?
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.760]   Is it the cloud provider?
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:45.760]   Do we have slow running queries?
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.760]   Is it our database broken?
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.760]   Did I introduce a bug in my last deploy?
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   But now you've got your whole team scrambling.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.760]   They're going from tool to tool, scratching their heads.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.760]   Messaging, do you see it?
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.760]   I don't know what's going on back and forth.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.760]   That is not the way to run an operation.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.760]   Unfortunately, it's a way about half the organizations in the world do it.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:12.760]   According to New Relic, they did a report only about half of all organizations have implemented observability for their networks and their systems.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.760]   Maintaining network observability is an issue for companies around the world.
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:20.760]   But this is not going to happen if you have New Relic.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:29.760]   New Relic's all about getting the answer to those questions fast, fixing the problem and getting back in bed before you even fully awake.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:30.760]   That's the goal, right?
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:35.760]   New Relic combined 16 different monitoring products you'd normally buy separately.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:41.760]   Because they're all integrated together, your team can see across the entire software stack in one place.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.760]   You get 16.
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.760]   I'll give you a handful of them.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:50.760]   There's the application monitoring system, APM, which gives you unified monitoring for your apps, your microservices.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:56.760]   If a service goes down, you'll know immediately and you know which one you'll know where and why and you can fix it fast.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   If you use Kubernetes, you'll love PIXI, instant Kubernetes observability.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.760]   All your traces are distributed.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:11.760]   No more, you can see all your traces without having to jump through a bunch of hoops, find and fix issues fast.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.760]   There's network performance monitoring that gets past the silo and gives you a system-wide correlated view.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.760]   No more fog.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.760]   You get to see it all.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.760]   You get to see it all clearly.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.760]   And that's just four of the 16 products.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.760]   It's so accurate.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.760]   You can pinpoint issues down to the line of code.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:36.760]   So if you did push a braking update, you can find it fast and fix it.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:46.760]   That's why the Dev and Ops teams at DoorDash and GitHub and Epic Games in more than 14,000 other companies use new Relective Debug and improve their software.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:47.760]   I don't know how.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.760]   If you don't have it, I don't know how.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:50.760]   You've survived without it.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.760]   Can I tell you the best part?
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.760]   You can do it right now for free.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.760]   Look, that middle of the night calls is waiting to happen.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.760]   Get new Relect before it does.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.760]   Get the whole new Relect platform.
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.760]   And 100 gigabytes of data free every month for the rest of your life.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.760]   You don't even need to give them a credit card.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.760]   Look, if you want to try it free forever, no credit card needed.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.760]   Just go to new Relect.com/MacBreak.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.760]   Is it the server?
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:19.760]   Is it the network?
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.760]   You may not know, New Relic knows.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:26.760]   N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C.com/MacBreak.
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.760]   I think that's an incredible offer.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.760]   No credit card needed.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:31.760]   They can't charge you.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:36.760]   You get the whole platform and 100 gigabytes of data a month, which is a lot free forever.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.760]   New Relect.com/MacBreak.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:40.760]   Please use that address so they know you saw it here.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.760]   NewRelect.com/MacBreak.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.760]   So I went back and forth because I had just bought such an idiot.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.760]   You heard me talking about it last week.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.760]   A brand new 4K monitor for Lisa, big 31-inch.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.760]   Brand new Brio camera for Lisa.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:02.760]   She's doing a lot of podcasts.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   She's doing a lot of video.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.760]   She's still doing a lot of work from home.
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.760]   She needs a nice setup.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.760]   She's earned it.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.760]   She deserves it.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.760]   She works really hard.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   She has that beautiful 49-inch display, that Dell display.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.760]   We want to replace the iMac because it's an eight-year-old iMac.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:20.760]   So I want to pull that out.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.760]   This is a great iMac replacement.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.760]   I thought, "Oh, I'm going to get it in the monitor, too."
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.760]   The studio display, not what was rumored.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.760]   We're talking about, "Oh, it's going to be 7K."
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:31.760]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.760]   No, this is, in fact, a normal monitor.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:41.760]   27 inches, 5K, not 7K, true tone.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.760]   Interestingly, it has an A13 bionic in it.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:46.760]   Yes, it's got a processor.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.760]   That's to drive the ultra-wide camera.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.760]   It does the center stage thing.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:55.760]   It's got full array mics in there.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.760]   Apparently, it's got great audio, too.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.760]   I mean, I'll have to, I'll hear it when I believe it.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:07.760]   But apparently, it's got something like six speakers in there and a subwoofer and all of that stuff.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:16.760]   It's got three 10 gigabit USB-C ports, one to Thunderbolt 4 port.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:17.760]   So it's a very nice monitor.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.760]   When I'm hearing them talk about it, I'm thinking, "That's a $2,000 monitor."
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.760]   In fact, I hope they can get it in under $2,000, $15.99.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.760]   So I had to buy it for Lisa.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.760]   She's earned it.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.760]   She'd say, "What?
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.760]   You only got me the max?"
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:32.760]   I'm going to say, "But I got you monitor, too!"
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:37.760]   And this, for camera and everything, I think this is going to be a good choice.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.760]   Yes?
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.760]   It really seems more like an accessory than a monitor.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.760]   It seems as though it's delivering so much.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.760]   So many features beyond simply, here is a way to look at the pixels that are
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.760]   imaginary inside the CPU.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:55.760]   For instance, you can power a laptop.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.760]   So it's really a dock as much as a monitor, right?
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:04.760]   And also the fact that it's got its own A13, A13, beyond it's a good.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.760]   It's like how soon before someone figures out how to get this thing to run
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.760]   Doom without anything plugging into it?
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:13.760]   Well, it confirms what I...
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.760]   My feelings that this is really...
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.760]   We're not going to do another iMac.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.760]   We're not going to do another iMac Pro, a high-end iMac.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.760]   We're going to decouple them.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:22.760]   We're going to do the iMac deconstructed.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.760]   And this would be the monitor of an iMac, right?
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.760]   With a T2 chip and all that.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.760]   The audio.
[01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:30.760]   And the audio, right?
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.760]   Great camera, great microphones, great audio.
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:33.760]   This is designed...
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.760]   Spatial audio.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.760]   Spatial audio.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:38.760]   It's not the...
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.760]   There's still an iMac.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:44.760]   If you want something all in one, there's still a very fast iMac.
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:45.760]   But it's 24 inches.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.760]   It's really...
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:47.760]   But that's...
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:48.760]   It's a fingerprint machine.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:49.760]   The pro is gone.
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:53.760]   I think if you're a pro, you're going to get the studio or the pro or the mini or whatever.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.760]   And that's the right way to go, I think.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.760]   Absolutely.
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.760]   I agree.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.760]   It's got the little tray for your fat boy.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.760]   I actually got Lisa...
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.760]   There's three different arms.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:07.760]   Not a thousand dollars, by the way.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.760]   Thank God.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.760]   There's a regular arm.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.760]   There's one that...
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:15.760]   Tilti-O-Soupy-Dupy kind of like a iMac thing.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.760]   And then there's a Visa mount.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:21.760]   I ended up getting her the middle one because I think she might be nice for her to be able
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:27.760]   to tilt it around and up and down and all that stuff.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:28.760]   Anything else to say about this?
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.760]   It's interesting that Apple abandoned this market.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.760]   They said, "No, I'll get somebody else's monitor."
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:40.760]   I think part of the problem is it's really hard to find good displays for Macs.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.760]   Like that really take advantage of what the Mac can do.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:46.760]   And so I think that Apple had to take care of this market because they build this kind
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.760]   of modified experience.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.760]   And then you have all the monitors that you try to buy, the Dell monitors.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.760]   And I have five Dell monitors.
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:54.760]   Yeah, that's what I bought.
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:55.760]   A beautiful Dell 4K.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.760]   It was $600.
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:57.760]   It's not expensive.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.760]   It was an after-price.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.760]   But they don't take full advantage of what the Mac can do.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.760]   And they're kind of like, "Oh, they're fine."
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.760]   Like they're cheap, so you buy them.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:10.760]   But I think Apple needed to get back into it because especially if you're going to move
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:15.760]   to this modular look, the Mac Minis and the Mac Studios and the Mac Pros, you got to...
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.760]   You got to be able to control that pipeline all the way through.
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.760]   So I think that that's part of it.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:20.760]   Is that really that?
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.760]   If we're going to make an iMac, we've got to make the monitors.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.760]   If you're not going to make the iMac Pro, you're going to have to make monitors that are supportive.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:34.760]   No, they have nothing to really offer in terms of giving someone a standard display unless
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:39.760]   they want to spend $5,000 for an absolutely best in class panel.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:44.760]   But what they can do is make a very human-oriented display that reflects the fact in the past
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:51.760]   five years, microphones in a webcam have gone from a weirdo thing that some weirdos who do
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:58.760]   podcasts have, and some people who chat with their grandchildren over Skype do to a basic
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:01.760]   part of the human computing experience.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:08.760]   And also the ability to do everything via one wire through Thunderbolt has also created
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:12.760]   this opportunity to make things very, very tidy and very, very clean.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:16.760]   And $1,600 is still more than I can spend on an external display.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:23.760]   But if certain deadbeats from five or six years ago finally came through objects, and
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:26.760]   I decided, hey, I wasn't expecting to get this $4,000.
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:29.760]   This is the sort of thing I might blow that money on because-
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.760]   If your Aunt Debbie passes, yes, your great Aunt Debbie-
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.760]   No, no, no, no.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:37.760]   I'm talking about- I'm a survivor of many publishing folks.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:38.760]   Oh, sorry.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.760]   We pay you, by the way, on time, right?
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.760]   You're not talking about us.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:43.760]   Yeah, okay.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.760]   Exactly.
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:45.760]   No, no, no.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.520]   That's one of the reasons Lisa needs an ice computer and an ice monitor so that you get
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:50.520]   paid on time.
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.760]   So think of it that way.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:52.760]   Exactly.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:57.760]   In fact, this is the tagline on Apple's site fits right in.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.760]   You know, that's exactly what they're saying.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.760]   This is for somebody who wanted to buy an iMac Pro.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:08.200]   I mean, when you think about what I've just bought with that, I'm not kidding that display
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:16.920]   right now, but if you look at what I just bought, you're talking $3,500 or maybe almost $4,000
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:20.560]   and now you have this incredible display with a very fast computer.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:25.560]   I mean, what's crazy is now the performance per dollar is going-
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.640]   The performance per dollar is getting better and better and better with the Mac instead
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   of it.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.000]   For a long time, it felt like it was going the other direction.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.840]   We're like, "We really love the operating system, but the computers are just, you know,
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:35.840]   they're good enough."
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:36.840]   But now it's just-
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:40.680]   Well, I remember when they came out with the 5K iMac and that was great, but the problem
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:42.680]   is you buy that and you're done.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.680]   I mean, this is-
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:49.240]   But you also never felt like you never felt like you were buying the fastest, best computer.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:54.040]   You were buying the best one within the ecosystem that we've chosen and we know that it'll be
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:59.240]   a little bit slower and we know that it's a little bit more constrained, but we love Apple.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.920]   We love our OS and we don't want to use PCs.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:05.480]   So I think there was a little bit of that now as a Mac user.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:10.680]   Kind of like I'm going to, you know, buy the fastest thing I can get for the dollar and
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:12.960]   it's, you know, a Mac.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:19.360]   So they also offer the nano-texture glass, which the XDR pioneered.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.240]   The glass you're not supposed to touch.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.320]   I hope they include the polishing cloth.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:29.440]   That'd be a $19 value.
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.440]   We should-
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.440]   I didn't get the nano-class.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.440]   That's-
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.440]   I didn't-
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.440]   No, I won't.
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.440]   I wouldn't get it.
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.440]   Just checking.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.440]   Just second with my consult consult.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:39.440]   If you're-
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.440]   If you're-
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:45.040]   What I wanted them to say is if you're in a bright environment with your computer, you
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.040]   should get blinds.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.040]   Get blinds.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.840]   They're cheaper and they're better.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:54.440]   It's just like I'm- it's important to me to put something on the screen to improve my
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:55.440]   lighting.
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.440]   I close everything down pretty quickly.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.440]   Like you're-
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.200]   Now here's something they didn't mention, but I see this in the fine print.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:06.800]   The A13 Bionic chip built into the monitor enables features like center stage, spatial,
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.800]   audio, and hay-seri.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:10.080]   Wow, that makes more sense.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.080]   I was trying to figure that out.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.720]   I was like, I got to research a little bit of that.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.360]   I was like, what's the-
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:17.200]   So you can talk to the monitor.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.200]   No.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:26.100]   No, that makes a lot of sense because the gatekeeper for that feature is an ASIC that just simply
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:29.880]   is always powered and is always listening for a hot word as opposed to keeping a big
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.880]   CPU lit up all the time.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.400]   So yeah, it's- that makes a whole lot of sense.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:37.840]   Again, it's an- it's the first time that Apple's done and monitor as a real accessory
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.800]   as opposed to just a screen with some ports on it.
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.960]   And it is- it is something specifically not just a monitor.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.120]   So you as a Mac user, I mean, I think it's somewhere in my future.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.000]   The problem is that I want to be able to route lots of different computers to the same
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000]   monitor.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.680]   So it doesn't make as much sense for me, but otherwise it's, you know, if you're just
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:01.760]   using like an old person, it is an incredible addition to what the computer already does.
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:04.760]   What else is on there that-
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:05.760]   This is secret to-
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.760]   I'm not expecting it.
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:13.760]   No, well, that- like if they're secure on-clape ships that you take advantage of, essentially
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.760]   the presence, it makes more sense now to think of that as a way to bring iPhone exclusive
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.160]   features to the Mac because all the stuff that requires that kind of stuff.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.160]   Yeah, can they 13 in there?
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:26.560]   If you do Face ID on a monitor, that seems like a future-
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.480]   Oh, and Drew.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:31.360]   There's no LiDAR though.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.720]   It's just a 12-megapixel camera.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.320]   They do offer a variety of reference modes.
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:39.720]   So they are kind of verging into the pro sphere.
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:46.040]   It's P3, Apple display, but also BT 7.9 and 601, P3 DC.
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.040]   That's what everything's been.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.520]   Everything's what you want is 7.9.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:51.840]   You're looking for a BT 2020.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:52.840]   That's what it doesn't do.
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.960]   The other one, but the P3 is good.
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:58.200]   And 600 nits is, you know, that's part of why the price goes down.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:03.080]   The difference between 600 nits and 1600 nits is a big difference when it comes to that.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:08.320]   12 megapixel ultra wide camera, 122 degree field of view, center stage.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:09.440]   So it moves around.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.680]   I like center stage and they do it more subtly than say the Facebook portal.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.520]   I wish that there was- I do wish that center stage would let us tweak it just a little
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.520]   bit.
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:21.360]   So you could say focus on this instead of just follow me around.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.520]   I would like to have little things like less headroom.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:31.960]   It naturally goes to like old- it naturally goes to old fashioned TV headroom like 2020.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:32.960]   It's like action.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:36.400]   It's like action safe, but that's not what we do on the internet anymore.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:39.280]   Like we're dipping into the, you know, right up to the edge.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.280]   And it just always feels uncomfortable.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.800]   Like every time someone's on center stage, I'm like, wow, I got a lot of headroom.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.480]   Well, there's a question from my lover in our IRC.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:49.240]   Maybe you can airplay to the monitor.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.360]   I think I'm very curious.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.520]   A13's got a lot of power in my own thing.
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.520]   It's more than you need normally.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.960]   So I kind of feel like you could, I mean, with an A13, you could theoretically do Apple
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.960]   Arcade, you know, or now.
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:38:59.960]   It's an Apple TV.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.120]   What is in the Apple TV?
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.320]   That's the Apple TV.
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.960]   The newer one has, I think, the A14, I think.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:06.960]   But it's maybe-
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.240]   It could be an Apple TV.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.680]   It could totally do what an Apple TV does in the monitor.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:16.600]   Like it could just be a, oh my goodness, it could be a TV.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:17.600]   Like literally-
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.600]   Well, they do show-
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:19.600]   Oh, it's like they're not that cool.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:23.520]   They do show foundation playing on it, but unfortunately, it says requires Apple TV.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.520]   So-
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:29.840]   Right, but you could, I mean, this is, they're now like right up on the edge.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.480]   Oh, they're doing, that's the TV is what you're saying.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.000]   They could literally, if they made it twice as big and just-
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000]   Next year.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.320]   Next year, they're verging on a TV, aren't they?
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.320]   It could be.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.320]   That's it.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.080]   And that's only, I think that's the 2019.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.080]   I'm looking it up right now.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.280]   That was in the 2019 iPhones.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.800]   So it's not as though they just had a-
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:51.800]   No, it's not.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:52.800]   It's a hyper-full of old chips.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.200]   Yeah, well they might have one of those.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:40:00.000]   Well, yeah, but I mean, it's like, this is, it's a current generation chip.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.320]   So it's not as though it-
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.680]   But you can do stuff.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:07.920]   But basically, if you bought an iPhone like two or three years ago, it had this chip.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:11.720]   So basically, it's not as though you've been orphaned behind by features that are only
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.400]   available in the A14.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.400]   So that is very interesting.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.240]   I wonder if there-
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:25.680]   I'm sure that I'm just like, you know, that's beard stroking here.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.560]   But boy, wouldn't it be great if there was-
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.920]   You bought one and you're happy with it because of all the features of a monitor.
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:34.440]   And then like in the fall, they said, oh, by the way, there's going to be a software
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:38.660]   update for your monitor that turns it into an Apple TV, that makes it into an AirPlay
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.760]   target that does all these things.
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:46.440]   Because that's a hell of- That's a very interesting chip to put into that display to just do things
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.000]   like run the camera.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.400]   And they do that.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:53.680]   They do these kinds of things where they put chips in the ultra wideband was in a lot of
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.680]   camera phones before they even started talking.
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:56.680]   Down the road, yeah.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:00.800]   It does say, interestingly, it has a list of the Macs that it's compatible with, but
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:06.480]   it also is compatible with the iPad Pros and the iPad Air 5th generation.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.480]   So I guess you-
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.480]   That's really interesting.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.560]   That is interesting, isn't it?
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.560]   That they even put it in there.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:17.240]   But having a TV with an A14 is- Oh my.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.560]   There's a lot that they can do.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.960]   They're not doing right now.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:22.560]   When you think, now that my head's getting wrapped around it, I'm-
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.320]   Because at first I was like, why would they do that?
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.800]   And now I- It's a TV.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:26.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.560]   Not yet, but soon.
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:29.560]   Make it.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:31.560]   What the hell?
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.560]   Putting M1 in there.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.560]   Go for it.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:34.560]   Exactly.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.560]   They got a lot of them.
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:36.560]   They're easy.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:37.560]   They make them fast, TSMC.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:38.560]   Greg, I'm out of the-
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:39.560]   M1.
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.400]   You know what?
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.320]   That's a product I'd be interested in.
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:44.320]   That's very appletive.
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.320]   Of course, $6,000.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:46.320]   Or $8,000.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.320]   To back into it like that.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:49.320]   Well, you get good at it.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.000]   You also are driving the price down of the components and everything else.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.480]   And you're figuring it out.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:59.760]   You can pro- a pro display with a couple extras is great and you can do a little surprise
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:04.160]   and delight with an extra being able to turn it on, make it an Apple TV.
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:07.480]   But you wouldn't want to come out of the gate trying to figure this out with a consumer
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.480]   device.
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:11.080]   You wouldn't even want a hint at it.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:15.400]   So it's up to people like us to make people start to expect these things by saying, "Ooh,
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.040]   wouldn't it be exciting if we do this?"
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:21.360]   Now we expect it like every- every Apple thing will be like, "Well, it's not the TV.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.200]   The TV we know is coming."
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.920]   We expect surprises and delights.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.920]   Oh, there you go.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:26.920]   Here are the other things.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:33.320]   Here's the other thing is, is that if you are going to go into AR and if you are going
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:38.400]   to do some of those things, having the TV be able to interact, having a brain of its
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:46.360]   own allows the display to interact with the the AR device in a much, much tighter way
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.520]   than going through the computer.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.600]   So there's a bunch of things that it could know and be able to do it.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.440]   So this also could be setting up for an AR integration.
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.880]   I was very surprised.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:43:01.680]   I really thought with the name peak P-W-E-K performance that we might see or hear or get
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.920]   a hint of AR/VR, the rumor mill was-
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.160]   That might have been it.
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:08.160]   May 13th.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.000]   You think that's it?
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:17.640]   I think that once again in a casual office somewhere in the spaceship, there are people
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.600]   who are cracking open beers, having a good laugh at all those people.
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:23.920]   All we meant was that we're going to give you a peek at some of the performance that
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:24.920]   we can do.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:28.320]   I can't believe that they thought that there was going to be a hovercraft in October.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.320]   Well, the rumor still says there will be a VR headset by the end of the year.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.600]   There'll be plenty more for Apple announced.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:39.280]   As we mentioned at the beginning of the show, at the end of their show, Tim Cook said, "And
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.880]   the Mac Pro, don't forget, or maybe John Turnus, the Mac Pro is still to come, the one more
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.280]   piece of the puzzle."
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:49.480]   And that was important because it also said, "That's it.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:51.880]   We're not going to do an iMac Pro.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:53.960]   We're not going to do a mini Mac Pro.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.200]   Maybe they will, but there's a Mac Pro and then that'll be it."
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:01.160]   But honestly, the studio for me is all the Mac Pro I'd ever want.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:05.160]   I mean, this is exactly what I would want a Mac Pro or a Mac Pro to be.
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:08.160]   I mean, they're feeling pretty cocky when they started talking about it, like, "Hey,
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.160]   we got one more.
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.160]   One more.
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:12.160]   We got something else coming."
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:17.760]   Because if you're going to call it a Mac Pro, if the studio looks like this, the Mac Pro
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:22.000]   has to be 1.5 to 2 times faster minimum.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000]   That's what they've been doing.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000]   Every set.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000]   Every set.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000]   Every set.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000]   Every set.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.120]   So is it M1 or M2?
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.120]   It's M2.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:32.120]   It's probably quad dye.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:34.920]   Yeah, very interesting.
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:38.680]   I mean, again, with a Mac Pro, you can make the dye a lot bigger.
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:44.600]   They can't fit into that, but you could make a much larger dye if you wanted to on a larger
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:45.600]   form factor.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.840]   From the beginning, I've always thought.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:56.120]   I think obviously it's no random chance that they're saving the Mac Pro for last because
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.120]   that's so...
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.360]   I think that's also very, very canny for them to say, "By the way, if you're waiting for
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:07.320]   the most powerful Macs that we are going to make with the first generation Apple Silicon,
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:10.840]   do not buy this one, please hold on to your money because we've got more to do."
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:15.080]   But I've always thought that, "Man, when they decide that we don't care about Power
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:19.600]   Per watt so much, we don't care about heat because we'll put in fans, we don't care
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:24.920]   about making a small-term attractive box, all we want to do is make faces melt.
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.800]   It's going to be something to see."
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.800]   It also freezes.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:33.000]   I mean, at this point, it's got to start freezing people's purchases on high-end PCs because
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000]   it's...
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.680]   Like, if they just saw what that just did and they think that one's going to go the other
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:42.480]   direction without the price, I think there's some companies that are going to be like, "Ooh,
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:45.840]   I might not buy that big Nvidia machine.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.640]   We might wait a little bit longer to see what Apple does with that."
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:54.520]   It doesn't fix anything.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:46:00.520]   People that are on a schedule aren't going to change what they're doing.
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:06.840]   But I think people who used to be on the Mac went to the PC and are thinking to buy
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:11.080]   another big machine might wait just a little while to see what happens.
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:19.480]   What do you think the people that Intel are thinking right now?
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:20.480]   I can't say what...
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:27.120]   They're just like, "They've got to be super worried."
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.200]   I wonder if we get Apple to make those chips in our factory.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.640]   They just talked about how we're just getting...
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.400]   We're as fast as the M1 and then...
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:38.000]   Well, I knew that they said that.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.640]   They had to say that then because it was only going to be true for a very short period
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:44.640]   of time.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.240]   I mean, the problem is that I think when they said it, they looked at Apple and they said,
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:49.480]   "Why are you still smiling?"
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:54.320]   He says, "Because I'm not left handed."
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.320]   I'm sure there's a joke and I'll have to...
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.120]   I mean, it's our little Princess Bride reference.
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:00.120]   Oh, Princess Bride.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.120]   Oh, yeah, I left handed.
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:02.120]   I get it.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.120]   I get it.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:04.120]   Why are you smiling?
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:05.120]   I don't understand.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:06.120]   That's good.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.120]   Actually, I like it.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.120]   That's exactly what's going on.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.120]   They are very good.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:18.000]   Quick point of Colm Jax on Twitter pointed out that...
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:25.120]   The new monitor actually has a better CPU than the 4K Apple TV.
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.080]   The 4K only has an A12 Bionic.
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:29.080]   Okay.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.080]   My thoughts exactly.
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:31.080]   They got an Apple TV in there.
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:33.000]   They're better.
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:34.000]   Very interesting.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.160]   What Apple is up to is mind boggling.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:45.120]   And they are absolutely showing that the moved Apple Silicon was the right thing to do.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:51.360]   They even showed that in some respects the Ultra is faster than the Zions, the top of
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.960]   the line Zion Mac Pro.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:57.240]   I just think about the last comment.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:02.360]   I realize you could be watching Apple TV while you're doing something else on the Mac and
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.680]   the monitor could just give it both, but the TV part wouldn't be processed on the Mac
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:06.680]   at all.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:07.680]   Picture in picture.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:08.680]   Picture in picture.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:11.520]   Just a little picture in picture running off the 813 Bionic.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:12.520]   Oh, big one.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:13.520]   Hey, Siri.
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.520]   Man.
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:17.520]   Play Ted Lasso again.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:19.520]   It's crazy.
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:28.160]   Or put a really, really big stack of battery packs behind it and turn it into a giant iPhone.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.160]   Exactly.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.680]   What are you doing?
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:33.160]   I'm making a call.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.320]   All we all we lack is the will to sell.
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:40.640]   That's why I got the Visa mount so I could have this headset with a Visa mount on it.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:45.280]   God, this creep on the subway was looking over my shoulder while I was texting on my 27
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:48.280]   inch iPhone.
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:50.120]   All right.
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:52.720]   Hey, I guess we should do pics.
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.640]   Do you guys want to do pics?
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.200]   I know what my pick is.
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:57.200]   And I'll draw.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.600]   Andy, Andy, what's your pick of the week?
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:04.240]   I had a very quick one because I didn't really plan ahead for this.
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:09.000]   This is the 20th anniversary of one of my favorite TV dramas, certainly my favorite cop drama
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.440]   ever, The Shield, which debuted on FXX 20 years ago.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.480]   And I won't give you the big talk up.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.800]   The all-alta-- it's on Hulu.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:20.160]   It's seven years.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:26.520]   I think it's-- I don't think there's ever been a more successful continuing drama on
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:31.360]   TV where it's not where they-- they decided to say, "Oh, here's the-- here's the-- here's
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:36.560]   this concept and we have the first six episodes mapped out and-- but we got shocked.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:38.640]   We were not ready to be successful.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:43.120]   So we had nothing-- we had no ideas after season three or season four.
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:48.200]   It is all about the-- this-- all seven seasons, which I saw like when they first aired, is
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:51.560]   all about what happens during the pilot.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.000]   It's one of the most meaningful pilots and they absolutely stuck the landing with the
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000]   final episode.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.640]   I don't think there's ever been a better final-- final episode, particularly of a drama.
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:04.000]   So I'm-- so that's all I'll say.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.280]   It is-- it is amazing the intensity they got, the characterization, the storylines they
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.280]   got.
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:16.720]   By the time you get to the end of it, it's just this earthquake of consequences finally coming
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.640]   to bear after seven whole seasons.
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.520]   So all I'll say is that go on-- go on to Hulu if you subscribe, watch the pilot.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.600]   I absolutely-- absolutely watch the pilot.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.720]   Obviously, watching seven seasons of a drama is a big ask.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:33.960]   But I think that if you-- even if you don't get into the entire story, it will be--
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:37.280]   one of the best 40-something minutes of television you've ever seen.
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:41.920]   And it will probably cook you into thinking, what the hell happens after this?
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:45.000]   And you'll-- it's one of those terrible things where you will all just watch the-- a few
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.720]   episodes in the first season just to see how this pays out.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:52.320]   And then like three weeks later, you're canceling stuff because, oh my God, what the hell is
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.120]   going to happen in the final three episodes?
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:58.600]   I'm watching-- you know, I really mocked Hulu for a long time.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:03.440]   I realized I'm watching a bunch of stuff on Hulu all of a sudden, including the dropout
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:07.080]   and Pam and Tommy, which is trashy, but I love it.
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:09.080]   If you can fight your way through that terrible interface--
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:10.080]   Oh, wonderful interface.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.080]   There's some good content there.
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:16.320]   I'm shocked at how much-- like I will-- I'll be watching something during lunch, and then
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:20.080]   I want to come back to that exact same show of the next episode during dinner.
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:23.800]   And the number of times I have to click my remote after getting into the Hulu app to
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:28.720]   get back to the thing I was just watching is atrocious.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:29.720]   Oh, I agree 100%.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:30.720]   100%.
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:34.240]   Actually, all of these programs are terrible, terrible.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.640]   Netflix, go ahead and try to find the thing you were just watching, or the new thing that
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:40.880]  -- I mean, it's crazy.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:43.400]   There are-- whoever's doing their UIs.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:44.720]   I actually got so complicated.
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:50.840]   I actually have in my Obsidian notebook a list of movies I started or shows I've started,
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:55.040]   shows I've finished, and now I've added the shield to shows I want to watch.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:58.640]   And then next to it, I have to put what happens on because I can never keep track of any of
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:51:59.640]   that stuff.
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:00.640]   Right.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:06.720]   I love Reno 911, but this is the second time since it was canceled off Comedy Central that
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.640]   there are new episodes for the original cast, the original writers, but it's on another streaming
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:15.200]   network that I can't subscribe to Roku just to watch this one show.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:19.240]   I can't-- I can't subscribe to Peacock or whatever Paramount Plus or whatever it was.
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:22.400]   To say nothing, I'm just trying to figure out what channel it's on.
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:27.200]   Like, oftentimes I'll be reading a review that is on AV Club or whatever.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:30.880]   That, oh, wow, this got me really-- this got me really interested, but it doesn't say what
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:33.240]   streaming service it's on or when it starts.
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:35.520]   So I-- it slips out of my mind.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:36.520]   It's hard.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:42.080]   This is one of the reasons why I keep going-- coming back to Plex that, you know, I buy--
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:44.720]   It's like I'll buy a movie.
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:45.720]   I'll rip it.
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:46.720]   I'll put it on to Plex.
[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:47.720]   And it's there for me.
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.720]   It was telling me like--
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:50.720]   You're smart.
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:51.720]   Here's what you were just watching yesterday.
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:54.160]   If you want to continue where you left off, go ahead.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:56.160]   Anyway.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.160]   I agree with you.
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:59.040]   Alex Lindsay, he's got a pick of the week.
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.040]   Go ahead, Alex.
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.200]   A robic cube.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.200]   I like the thing.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:08.640]   I like the thing Chris Benwick, who's in office hours and he-- there's been a bunch
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:11.880]   of discussions about Rubik's cubes and he's very fast at it.
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:12.880]   I'm horrible at it.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:16.480]   But I got excited about it because he was talking about it.
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:19.320]   He was watching him do it and I was like, OK, which one is that?
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:21.480]   And he's like, oh, this one's really, really good.
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:22.480]   And--
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:23.480]   So these are not--
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.480]   You know, officials, Rubik cubes.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:27.200]   This is not-- and I got to tell you, as someone who grew up with one--
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.200]   Speed cubes.
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:31.120]   As someone who grew up with one, this is an entirely different level.
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:34.400]   Yeah, because it was always so hard to turn and squeak it.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.400]   So this one has--
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:37.400]   It's one.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:39.400]   It better be good for $64.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:40.400]   No, mine's 71.
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:41.400]   Oh, my God.
[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:43.240]   You have to be very dedicated to the Rubik's--
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.240]   The thing is it's got magnets in it.
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:47.120]   So when you spin it, it just stops.
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.120]   So you can--
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.120]   I like it.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:50.120]   It'll find it.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:51.120]   It sounds good, too.
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:52.120]   It has a nice--
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:55.920]   The better part about it is it's not just that the movement is really nice.
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:56.920]   It's that it has--
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:59.160]   I'm going to misplace it, but hold on.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:02.520]   Did you get the stickerless one or the sticker one?
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.760]   You could get one without stickers that you put your stickers on.
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.760]   Oh, we would have it in.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:11.760]   It comes with these little adjustable wrenches to change the--
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:19.480]   Oh, it's basically the unholy child of a Rubik's cube and a fidget spinner.
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:21.480]   Together it's true in everything.
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:23.480]   It is an ultimate fidget spinner.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:25.480]   Because I sit there and I'm just like--
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:26.920]   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:29.480]   It's kind of numerical variable nut.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:32.800]   And so you can actually change it.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:36.040]   And when you watch-- this is like what the folks who do competition--
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:38.480]   Yeah, competition is really skewed.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:42.120]   And so it is-- and it's quite a pleasure.
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:47.040]   And I have to admit that if I'm in a really, really slow meeting, most of the time I'm the
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.440]   one talking, so I don't use this very much.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:51.520]   But if I'm in a meeting where I'm just like, it's really nice.
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:52.680]   I just sit there and just like, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:54.440]   And sometimes I finish one of the sides.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:58.520]   Is this the Maglev UV coated three by three speed cube?
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:54:59.840]   Mine is the Maglev frosted.
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:00.840]   Yeah, frosted.
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:02.480]   Maglev frosted, okay.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:03.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:04.480]   From GAN, G-A-N.
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:06.480]   Is the GAN store.
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:07.480]   They got them all.
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:08.480]   I guess they've must--
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:11.280]   Yeah, they've kind of-- everybody's got their own flavor up them.
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.280]   This is the one.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.280]   And these guys are the--
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.320]   It doesn't say Rubik's cube, it just says cube.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:17.880]   Right, right, because they can't.
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:18.880]   They can't.
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:22.880]   But they have for beginners, they have smart cubing, advanced cubes.
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.880]   And so we're-- I have to admit, there's--
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:34.160]   It turns out that another member, Grant Whitehead in Australia, his son, is really good.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.840]   Like really good at this.
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:38.440]   And then Chris is really good too.
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:43.080]   So we've already decided there'll be some office hours, like after hours, things of
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:46.240]   us learning how to actually do this like a pro.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:47.240]   So--
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:48.240]   I want one.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:53.040]   Maybe they'll make it with a little motor in it so I can connect it to a USB port so I
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:55.040]   can write a program so it'll--
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:57.120]   Yeah, they do them.
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:03.000]   They have ones that manipulate this and it's like a second 1.3 seconds or something like
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000]   this.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:11.040]   So somebody has made a self-contained self-solving Rubik's cube with internal motors.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.040]   And it looks--
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.040]   I don't know.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.520]   I mean, you've seen all these robots that do the manipulation outside.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:20.280]   So this is like, no, you mix it up, you put-- there you go.
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:23.040]   You put it on a table and it just solves itself.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.040]   That's awesome.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:27.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.680]   This was on Adam Savage's tested channel.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.520]   That's how you know about it.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:35.520]   That's definitely like you time travel back like a--
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:40.720]   a Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Court, but you time travel back to like the 1980s.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:45.240]   If you like to set this thing down in 1982 on a table in lunchroom, that's how you are
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.240]   a god.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.240]   We will follow you anywhere.
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:48.240]   Yeah, really.
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.240]   You're a sorcerer.
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:51.600]   And there'll be an eclipse tomorrow at 3 p.m.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:52.600]   Ah!
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:53.960]   How does he know it?
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:55.360]   That's really so cool.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:57.800]   A self-solving Rubik's cube.
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:56:59.960]   Holy komoly.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:00.960]   There it is.
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:01.960]   Yo!
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:05.320]   We have a winner.
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:06.800]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:07.800]   Great to have you.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:08.800]   Thank you.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:11.720]   Andy, Andy, when will you be on GBH next?
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:17.160]   I'm off this week, but next week at 12.30 on Friday, WGBHNews.org, or go to the
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:24.160]   G
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.160]   Boston Public Library.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.160]   You can watch it live.
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:28.160]   There's Frederick Van Johnson doing his review of the Panasonic GH6 on today's Office Hours.Global.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.880]   Office Hours continues to be the most amazing.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:35.160]   It's the equivalent of a self-solving Rubik's cube for broadcast.
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:39.840]   Well, and if you go back and look at the Saturday session, I think we have it.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:40.920]   It might be up there.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.400]   We built-- this is the beginning of our Saturday sessions.
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:46.400]   So this is our--
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.280]   So this is-- we built this system out of a pizza box.
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:51.280]   And so--
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:52.280]   What is it?
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:54.280]   What does it do?
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:59.080]   It's going to be-- so the function is for us to learn, really, how to program it.
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:07.120]   This is using the BBC Microbit into what's called a Makerbit, which basically unleashes
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:08.880]   the little Microbit.
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:12.520]   And so you've got this little-- it's kind of like an Arduino.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:15.440]   It's similar to that, except it's a little easier to program.
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:18.600]   And so anyway, so a bunch of us got together.
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:24.080]   Roger Wagner, who's been teaching this for a long time, mostly the kids, but we're big
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:25.440]   kids.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:30.480]   So he sent these to us, and we step by step went through building these all together.
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:34.520]   And it's going to be like a little tally light, and it can push things out, and we're
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:36.200]   going to program it next weekend.
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:40.400]   So we spent like three hours building this thing and wiring it together, but all together.
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:43.880]   So it's like we're all sitting there, and what's funny is when you do it, when you
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:49.400]   build a whole bunch of people with multi-camera, it's so much more fun, because there's Roger.
[01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:53.800]   And so when everybody has multiple cameras, it gets to be a really fun thing to do, because
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:58.520]   you're actually seeing what the other ones are doing and what we're putting together.
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:58:59.520]   And it was--
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:01.480]   It's like the world's best club.
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:02.480]   It is.
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:04.120]   What a fun.
[01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:06.120]   Three hours just evaporated for me.
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:07.120]   It was just like, we didn't stop.
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:08.120]   We didn't take any breaks.
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:11.560]   We were like, we're just kind of cooking through it and just having a great time.
[01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:13.120]   But we're going to program it this weekend.
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:15.200]   We're going to program these.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:18.040]   And then we'll keep on doing bigger projects with them.
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:21.480]   But it's just a lot of microprocessor fun.
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:22.960]   Alex, have an important question.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:25.320]   Are your members allowed to marry outside the group?
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:26.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:30.280]   Yeah, that's how you bring more people in.
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:31.280]   Good.
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:32.280]   It's the ear forward.
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:33.280]   It's the ear forward.
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.280]   It's the ear forward.
[01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:35.760]   You surround them, and then you marry up.
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:39.760]   Marry, marry, marry out, and then you become part of the tribe.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.400]   For a few months, I like to ask that question just to make sure that--
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:45.080]   Office hours.global.
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:48.480]   And of course, if you want to hire Alex to do your next streaming event,
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:52.680]   090.media.
[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:53.680]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:54.680]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:57.320]   Renee, I'll be back next week.
[01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:01.440]   I hope to tell us all he has learned from Apple.
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:03.240]   What a day this has been.
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:05.040]   What a rare mood I'm in.
[02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:10.560]   It's almost like charging $10,000 in five minutes.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.480]   It's almost like being $10,000 in debt.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:14.200]   Yeah.
[02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:15.120]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:18.240]   We do Macbreak Weekly every Tuesday, very conveniently,
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:21.560]   after the Apple events, as it turns out.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.800]   11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern.
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:26.680]   Thank you, Apple, for keeping it to 57 minutes.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:29.440]   Perfect timing.
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:31.440]   Which means you can watch us live, if you want.
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:33.440]   Live.twit.tv.
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:36.600]   If you're watching live chat with us live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:39.400]   If you're a member of Club Twit, there's a Discord channel.
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:43.000]   Not only for every show, but for every topic under the Sun Stacey's Book Club,
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.840]   the Untitled Linux Show, the Giz Fizz, this week in Space.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:50.200]   Lots of good stuff going on in the club these days.
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:54.560]   I think at the end of the month, Paul Therrot will be our guest for a fireside chat
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:56.000]   with Aunt Pruitt.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.640]   If you want to know more, just go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:02.280]   $7 a month is all it costs to be a member of the club.
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:06.080]   You also get ad-free versions of all of our shows, and a lot of additional content that
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:08.440]   doesn't make it to the podcasts.
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:10.520]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:13.040]   Thank you so much for supporting us that way.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:14.040]   It's great.
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:18.400]   After the fact, of course, we still offer everything we do on demand free at our website.
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:21.760]   In the case of this show is twit.tv/mbw.
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:24.320]   When you go there, you'll also see a link to the YouTube channel.
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:27.120]   All the shows have their own dedicated YouTube channel.
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:32.640]   Next week, I think, really, would be to get a podcast player and subscribe.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:35.880]   That way, you get it automatically the minute it's available, and you can leave us a five-star
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:38.040]   review, too, if you would.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.920]   Help spread the word about Mac Break Weekly.
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.680]   Thanks, guys.
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.480]   We'll see you next week.
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:46.320]   As for you, get back to work.
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:47.600]   Because you know what?
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:51.000]   Break time is over, and I got some ordering to do.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.960]   Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astra Magazine.
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:58.880]   And each week, I'm joined by Tariq Malek, the editor-in-chief over at space.com.
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:03.200]   In our new This Week in Space podcast, every Friday, Tariq and I take a deep dive into
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:05.400]   the stories that define the new space age.
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:06.560]   What's NASA up to?
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:09.200]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:11.360]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:12.800]   When are those coming home?
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:15.000]   What the heck has Elon Musk done now?
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:18.600]   In addition to all the latest and greatest in space exploration, we'll take an occasional
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:22.480]   look at bits of spaceflight history that you probably never heard of.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:25.600]   And all with an eye towards having a good time along the way.
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:27.200]   Check us out on your favorite podcatcher.
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:39.320]   [MUSIC]
