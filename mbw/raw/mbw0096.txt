[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100]   This is Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.600]   We are gathered round once again to discuss all things Macintosh.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.380]   And I am so glad you are here today joining us in studio, Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixel
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.380]   Core.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.380]   Hello.
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.380]   Hey Alex.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.940]   Pixel Core.com, Pixel Core.tv for the podcasts.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.660]   And we are going to see a lot more of you I think.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.660]   Yes.
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.660]   I hope anyway.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.660]   This week and next week at least.
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.980]   But we are looking at places where wandering around Petaluma.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.380]   I have offered Alex a stool in the corner.
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.020]   Right by the fire.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.020]   Right by the fire.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.020]   That was the key.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.220]   I wasn't sure until I knew I could be near a fire.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.060]   You will be right next to the fire.
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.680]   So on the horn as it were we have Mr. Scott Born on the horn from his special studio.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.680]   Hello.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.680]   Hello.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680]   Hi there.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.680]   Hi there.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.680]   Our day to go labs.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   Scottborn.com is one place to go.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.120]   That's the best place to go to find everything.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.940]   We are going to run over to Twipp Photo where me and Alex do this weekend photography.
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.440]   Oh yeah, I love this week.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.560]   In fact we were talking before the show began about you're going Nikon.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.560]   I made.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.860]   That's a shocker, Scott Born.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.760]   After like 17 years I made the switch.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   Wow.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.620]   This sort of, this was such big news that you served the Obama campaign fighting with the
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.740]   McCain campaign over who's a better general.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.980]   That's how huge this story is.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.980]   It's that big.
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.980]   It's so big.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.340]   We'll tune to Twipp for more about why you made that.
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.180]   We're going to have an in-depth discussion.
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.740]   I'm sure Fred is going to needle me.
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.700]   Fred's going to give you a little therapy session.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.900]   Actually Fred's a Nikon guy, right?
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.900]   We're slowly becoming on Nikon.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.420]   I mean I'm, you're not a Nikon guy.
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.580]   I'm on my way.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   I'm going to test.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.560]   I'm going to test Scott's and then I'm going to see if I think Scott was crazy then I'll
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.840]   stick with my Canon but I have a feeling that by the end of August I could end up in the
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   Nikon.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.200]   I already made the Nikon Canon switch.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.800]   I can't switch back.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.240]   I've spent so much money on lenses.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.480]   It's not going to do it.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   It's not going to happen.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.880]   Scott's selling all his lenses though.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.680]   Everything sold except one lens.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.080]   I sold like $20,000 with a gear in four hours yesterday.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.280]   But did you make it back?
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   Did you let me, you lost someone.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.280]   Oh heck no.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280]   I took a huge loss.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   That's the problem.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.240]   But you know it's like I was always going to take a huge loss if I made the switch.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.600]   I just felt like I really wasn't getting what I needed out of the Canon system.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.360]   Nikon jumped ahead in my opinion.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.560]   I can switch back if I can.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   Canon's coming back.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.240]   And by the way you know these are both, the Nikon chip is a Sony chip.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.560]   We're not going to do a chip here.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.920]   But Sony is going to do the same thing with what is it?
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.080]   22 megapixels or 29 or something like that.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   I know.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.400]   You know we're just good.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.240]   Also here Mr. Merlin Man.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   Hello Merlin Man.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   Hello.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   How are you today?
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.240]   From the fabulous, I'm fantastic Merlin.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   I have now.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.560]   You sound clear.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.720]   You sound like you got a big wide open space.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.840]   You sound like you got Alex nearby.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   It sounds great.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   I did.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   I'm wearing, you know that little tape that they wear on their noses so that they, so
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.240]   you can have a better breathing.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.240]   I'm using that now.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.640]   Oh you breathe right.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.920]   Can you tell the breathe right strip?
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.400]   Can you tell it's in play?
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Terrific.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   You sound like you're breathing freely.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.520]   I am breathing freely.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.680]   You look nice today is the place to go for Mr. Man's fabulous podcast.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.920]   You know why I'm happy today?
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.000]   I have finally caught up.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I've listened to every show.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.120]   I can now be part of the in crowd when you do in jokes.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.120]   I know.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.200]   You and your four friends.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   You're four.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.680]   No you have a big community because when you, you know, like when you did the snare thing,
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.640]   the snare size thing, the newest exercise sensation sweep in the nation, there's some
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.240]   great submissions to Flickr of snare posters.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.680]   A lot of people who are program or shut-ins and they're looking for a pick off, just really
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.080]   take up the top 400 pounds so they can get out.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.800]   They're very, very hungry at this point and they need a way to just take up enough to
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.880]   get out, be able to get on like a rascal or maybe two rascals and be able to get some
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.360]   place where they got like powdered donuts.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   So we're helping.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.320]   Well, you succeeded.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.880]   I think that's really good snare.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.120]   And also with us today, I'm very pleased to say Andy Enoco, the Chicago Sun-Time.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.480]   Somehow the rain seems to be trickling off in beautiful places.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.000]   Well, that's actually very good news here, Leo, because here at the Tonga room with the
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   hotel, Falmermont in San Francisco, the rain signals that the bandstand has pulled out
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.200]   into the lagoon and we're about to be favored with Polynesian favorites.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:28.640]   I love the Tonga room.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   I used to go there to watch a radio show that KSOFO used to do, it's a Friday afternoon
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.380]   show there with Buddy Hatton.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.280]   I love that.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.360]   It's not the cheapest Pad Thai you will ever eat, but it's definitely an experience that
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.920]   you should have at least once in life.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.800]   But did they turn off the rain while you were there doing the radio show?
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.040]   No, it comes every, what is it, every hour or something like that?
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.800]   Every hour on the hour, the rain starts, it fills the pool, then the boat comes out of
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.920]   the lagoon, they fly their set, and then the rain starts again, signaling that God has
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.240]   been displeased by this play of music.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.240]   The band receives!
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.240]   The band receives!
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.920]   Exactly, it goes out of the lagoon and into its little parking spot.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.920]   It's like talking about a giant Polynesian cuckoo clock.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.720]   Exactly, it's like a life-sized cuckoo clock.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.160]   The rain that was preceded, I think the waiter goes in the back and he flips the light switches
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.040]   on and off because it's preceded by lightning and thunder.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.280]   That's right, lightning and thunder makes it.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.760]   There's lightning and thunder.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.120]   No, no, this is a class act, they actually have strobe lights.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.480]   Also want to welcome Jeff Smith, I'm really pleased to have Jeff here.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.160]   Jeff is a musician from Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.040]   You probably, I know you've heard his stuff.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.240]   He's the guy who did "I'm a Twit" which is one of my favorite songs we played all the
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   time.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.040]   In fact, Jeff has become the closing theme for the Twit Live production.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.800]   That is so awesome.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   Hello everybody.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.920]   I play it and then I leave the cameras on and I slowly turn out all the closed curtains,
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.320]   lock the windows, turn out the lights and then wander off.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   It's that type of song, right?
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.360]   It's a cozy kind of, it's kind of pathetic really.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.960]   It's like, I feel like the clown, who's the clown that sweeps his way off the stage?
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   Anyway, I'm a Kelly.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   Hey!
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   It's nasty.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.160]   Anyways, good to have you Jeff's new album, "1s and 0s" came out yesterday.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.160]   Where do we go to?
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.480]   Do go to the JeffSmith.com, V. JeffSmith.com to get that?
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.640]   You go to the JeffSmith.com, I just made a post about it.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.040]   Actually, one of my other projects, Ringtone Feeder, I'm actually using that platform to
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.360]   deliver this record since everything was all set up there.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.160]   So I'm launching it there at Ringtone Feeder.com.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.120]   We'll talk more about that later in the show and I want to ask you how you do that because
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.120]   Ringtone Feeder is kind of needed, hooks into iTunes so that you automatically get Ringtones
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   into your iTunes.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.600]   It's different and crazy and fun.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.240]   Yeah, I want to know how you do that.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.520]   It's really cool.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.600]   So we'll talk more about that.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.720]   We should get to the Mac news of the day because gosh knows.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.560]   There's not much to talk about and if we start now, we might be done before lunch.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.920]   Big story I guess and I'll let you take the lead on this.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:09.720]   Mr. Scott Born is AT&T finally coming out with some prices there.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.920]   Yes, and the news is not all good.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.560]   In fact, it's pretty uniformly bad.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   But it could be worse.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.320]   We could be in Canada.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:25.000]   Yeah, I got to say that if anybody recalls back when we started this iPhone madness about
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.600]   year and a half ago, I always said that I thought the weakest link in this deal was the
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.160]   AT&T participation and that's certainly proving itself right now because they released the
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   pricing.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.360]   I'm sorry, I mean, it's not that people can't afford it, but I just think they're kind
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   of gouging.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.720]   They're not including Annie.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.200]   I don't know.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.480]   Is it hailing now, Andy, where you are?
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.480]   Is that actual hail?
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.760]   Hitting the tin roof of your pull-up?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.000]   Yes, yes, but I'm going to stay at my post here reporting here at the end of the iPhone
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.880]   line in Boston, Massachusetts.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.600]   I don't know.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.880]   How many people are in line now one week before the iPhone comes out, Andy?
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.160]   Back to you and the cozy custom made downtown San Francisco studio with a cooler full of
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.360]   sodas and tapas and all that kinds of stuff.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   Hey, that reminds me.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.000]   Hey, can we have an IQ or brain tonic in here?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Thank you.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.080]   Okay, wait a minute.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.080]   Is that real?
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   Yeah, that's real.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.640]   I thought that he was actually at the conquer room.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.320]   It sounds like a sis-admin that just had way too much at it all.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.240]   It's a just crazy typing noise.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.840]   I thought that was typing.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   It sounds like the VORAC's keyboard.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.840]   Thank you.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.120]   This is my dedication to this show, everybody.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.080]   If you were here, Andy, I'd give you one of these notes.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.080]   God, cool.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.120]   That was one of those like thunderclaps that happens right when the lightning comes down.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.680]   Oh, god.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   Time for brain tonic.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.080]   Anyway, I think you'd pick a job with UPS maybe.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   I don't know.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.800]   I'm going to put it on mute so you guys can talk.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:10.000]   It was quiet for a minute and all of a sudden it's like we got dwarves hammering in the
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   mountainside.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.280]   I feel like perhaps what was happening was that God was mad at the charging for the SMS
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.720]   text minutes on the new iPhone.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.640]   Now, so, okay, let's get back to the news.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:27.160]   Now that Gato Dama wrong has passed over, AT&T put out some videos.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.800]   In which they explained all this.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.560]   Yeah, and they also have a little PDF file which you can download.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.320]   We have a copy of it at applephoneshow.com.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.680]   But I don't need no spanking video to know they're charging me more for text messages
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.400]   than they were and that you got to pay $5 a month minimum whereas it used to be bundled
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   in the deal.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.320]   You also have to pay $18 which is basically just sort of like some guy sat in a boardroom
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.720]   and said I want an extra $18 so charge him that to do an upgrade.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.680]   And so now we're starting to get to the point where originally we're talking about this
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.040]   being about 40 bucks over the life of the contract.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.520]   Now it's a lot more, isn't it?
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.560]   No, it's getting to be quite a bit more and I'm not feeling it.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.560]   What can I say?
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.040]   First of all, I should say the $18 for the upgrade is that's cheaper than the $36 activation
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.640]   that they charge to new users.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.120]   So they're giving you a break of $18.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.840]   Yeah, but you're already a customer.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840]   You need to charge you anything.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.880]   Let me just finish this one point here.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.800]   I mean, first of all, as I've said a long time, I don't care about GPS right now.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.240]   Now I realize I may change my tune if there's some apps that do cool push stuff to the GPS
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.120]   but right now I don't care about that and I don't need 3G because I live in the cloud.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.120]   I'm wondering if I'm even going to upgrade.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.120]   That would shock the conscious of the nation but I may not.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.640]   Let's watch some of those fine AT&T videos.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.080]   Here's some customers in the AT&T storage.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.320]   My Larry Meyer for AT&T was some important news for customers new to AT&T about how to
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.920]   be ready to buy an iPhone 3G beginning at two days.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   Oh, please.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   Global time Friday July.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.880]   How to be ready to buy an iPhone.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.040]   What do they think?
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.520]   This is crazy.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.080]   Steve's got to be going crazy.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.320]   This is exactly what Steve hates the most.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.240]   Is anyone else actually talking in public?
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.240]   I think that's the...
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.920]   Well, we do know now it's 8 a.m.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.920]   Right.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   I think I'm raising a lot of the phone companies have struggled.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:26.200]   It's not because they've made a substantially underpowered product with a lot of bad apps.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.840]   It's because I think really historically people have not been prepared to buy.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   I think a lot of times people go in there and they're kind of confused.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.000]   What do I do?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.680]   Will I need money?
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.600]   Will the phone be like this as a phone?
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.400]   What do I do?
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   I don't understand.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.920]   They get picked up guys.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.240]   You guys are haters.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.920]   I think really to get people ready for the experience you've got to explain that there's
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.520]   a store and you need to come in and get a phone.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.880]   Oh, but actually they do need to prepare people because you need to bring documentation
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.880]   with you.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.880]   Oh, really?
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   Oh, there's paperwork involved.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.720]   You've got to bring stuff with you.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.560]   Now they also, I noticed, they picked a guy.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   I don't know.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.560]   Is this a smudge under his lip or does he have...
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.880]   If he got everybody talking about this, they're waving his hands around.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.480]   He also looks like he's got one of them hipster soul tab fans.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.200]   The first thing to remember is there's no benefit to switching your service prior to
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   July 11th.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   Okay.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.200]   Everybody remember that?
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   There is no benefit.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   You've got to bring that.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   It'll be a test after the show.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   So everybody be happy.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.840]   Sometimes helping you prepare is telling you to prepare to not do something before you're
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.840]   supposed to do it.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   That's part of the process.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   Really.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   Preparing to not be prepared.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.800]   Sometimes what you want to do is sometimes telling them what first not to do.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.840]   A little AT&T is the fans.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.960]   I think that what they're trying to do is there's no other phone that has long lines
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.960]   that build up.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.920]   And they are now requiring activation in stores.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   You can't walk out of the store.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.160]   So people being confused or not having what they need will greatly reduce the number
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   of the everybody's experience.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.520]   And you can only buy one phone.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   One phone.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.520]   Well here's the deal.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.640]   They say you can buy three but they have to be activated at a time.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.960]   I don't know how then.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.000]   I talked to some people at the Apple store and they said yeah the net effect is Scott
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.640]   you can come in and buy one phone and activate it.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.080]   And then somebody else can come in with you and buy a phone with you and activate it.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.040]   It was kind of really bizarre the way they tried to explain it to me.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.560]   I bought like 11 of them last time.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.440]   I can only buy one apparently.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.520]   This is not a good AT&T please.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.000]   I mean what you want to do is make your product really hard to get.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.360]   That's marketing 101.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.360]   If you want you can.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.360]   Hey good news.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.040]   If you don't if you want to buy an iPhone and not activate it they will sell it to you
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:47.120]   have 599 for the 8 gigabyte 699 for the 16 gigabyte model.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   So you pay the full price and these no contract phones won't be available on July 11th.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.880]   They don't say exactly when they'll be available.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.880]   They'll be offered.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.840]   But here's a hint.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.120]   Just go ahead and buy it.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.480]   Sign the contract and then terminate pay the $175 early cheaper.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.720]   And if you've saved 200 bucks and you got an unlocked phone.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.680]   Aren't you glad you listened to the show today ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.680]   You could have watched that stupid AT&T video.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.000]   But no.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.240]   Is that an unlocked phone or you're just on the hardware.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.360]   Well it's it's I think there's not the eight the phone right it just means that you're
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.520]   free from that to your contract that if you decide to that right back and they're not
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.480]   offering go phones as far as I know they're not offering a pay as you go plan.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.720]   Andy couldn't you then just drop a T mobile sim in that phone and make it work.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.840]   But it wouldn't it wouldn't be unlocked.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.840]   All you're buying for as far as now I have to explain that I've been rereading and rereading
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.720]   these terms and also and literally saying okay now let's see what apple insider has to say
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.760]   about it does to see if they interpreted the same way that I do.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.520]   The way that I interpret the language that they have there is that for the extra amount
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.720]   of money all you're buying is a freedom from a contractual obligation to AT&T.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.800]   So that if you know if you did decide to if you did decide that maybe you know Boston is
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.560]   a really wet miserable place to live.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.880]   I want to live in somewhere it's someplace sun here without AT&T service you would still
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.280]   have a phone that doesn't actually work on the local Australian network but I would not
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.200]   have to keep paying seventy dollars a month AT&T for two years.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   We're not using it.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.680]   How do you guys know if you guys maybe it's just me but I feel like I'm on the phone less
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.560]   now that I have an iPhone like I used to be running around with little twittering more.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   That's probably it I've never I'm hardly ever like walking around with the phone go browsing
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.360]   but I'm even not even doing that that much I find your moments of the day where I'm just
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.640]   calmly not alone.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.560]   I was checking out my minutes and I realized that I have a little less than 3000 rollover
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:45.240]   minutes I used like just a handful of a handful of my talk minutes I'm using more texts than
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.800]   I ever have.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.520]   It's all it's all a data push device it's all it is for me.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:55.320]   Well I know that I generally prefer people to contact me via SMS because I don't want
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.640]   to I like to have short conversations where I know exactly how long they're going to be
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.080]   in exactly what the you know what I don't like is generally getting hung up in a long
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:09.400]   conversation so and so it's well that's good because the the $60 plan only gives you 500
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.800]   minutes so you should you know it's good you're talking less yeah now now I don't understand
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.880]   are the plans just general AT&T plans now let's see what talk for the AT&T phone store says
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.840]   no waiting list and all of our stores are operating on a first come first serve basis
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.280]   but there are still a few things you can do to be ready to switch your service prior to
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:34.600]   July 11 what would what would you do Merlin man to be ready to switch prior to July 11th
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.080]   seriously like what would I do yeah okay first thing yeah should probably get some comfortable
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:45.680]   clothes okay I would say I would say have a have a light lunch mmm it really really
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.840]   you want to be very hydrated you don't want to be nauseous in any way no no no I think
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.320]   you want to be ready and I think you need to be dynamic so it's kind of like getting
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.480]   ready for a sigmoidoscopy kind of or a colonoscopy yeah exactly yeah you drink you drink a lot
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.680]   of kind of like a foul fluid and then you hold it really do the Tai Chi before you do
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.120]   it to kind of to kind of calm yourself I think I choose a fantastic idea I think actually
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.840]   I think anything that's going to help you just be in the moment and just be ready for
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   the dynamism that is buying a cell phone is going to be is going to serve you and really
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.680]   just a lot of the lot you know Alex like you know this from your training in the martial
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.200]   arts I think really you know probably 95% of this is mental mentally being ready to have
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.480]   a new phone exactly exactly and the thing is is that the Tai Chi will calm you down but
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.800]   if you speed it up you can actually use it to push other people out of line so it's very
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.080]   important to kind of get get yourself flexible and ready to go that's an excellent point
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.960]   if you're not familiar with manipulating matrix time now is the time to take that pill and
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.200]   start taking those lessons bullet time you just you just do a little arc running over
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.000]   the wall and it's you're running across the wall it's very effective alright good exactly
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.080]   although realize that if you don't have that really big pretentious flappy idiotic code you're
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.640]   really only doing it halfway you don't want to slap at this you want to punch at this yeah
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.680]   Merlin yeah no I think it's all terrific ideas I guess I'm just kind of bummed that AT&T
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.640]   didn't go into more detail about the different ways well let's check it out here's what Todd
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:09.080]   from the AT&T phone store has to say we call it being I ready so when you get to an AT&T
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.040]   store like this one we'll have all the information we need to get you up and running quickly
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:21.400]   with so I would say go in the store and say I ready I ready I ready I came on the show
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.880]   but I'm ready be sure to wear those hands that drop easily so you can I bend I quickly
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:33.360]   this will help the line move I fast I get it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.880]   yeah yeah yeah sure not the I fight back ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.200]   don't I fight we're doing it I for you does it Alex do a good jar jar does I like to a
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:54.840]   a jar jar bings mmm I'm not really mmm that's the only thing AT&T could have done to do this
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:03.120]   better is maybe to have jar jar bings deliver it's time for drum roll AT&T and a new iPhone
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:09.080]   3G the great news is if you are new to AT&T or adding a new AT&T wireless phone line you
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.960]   can purchase iPhone 3G for $199 with a two year contract lead with the great news I think
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.120]   that's a smart thing to do I mean actually that's serious that's it right there mmm
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.880]   everybody listening who once worked like got it took a job at McDonald's or Burger King
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:28.440]   is now having a flashback of welcome to the McDonald's team yeah I remember by adding
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:34.520]   three times as much meat what we call QSP QSP you know I actually watched those videos
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.160]   when I worked at McDonald's in high school watch those videos the QSP and later on they
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.320]   added there was QSP quality service value and I think they added like not botulism I think
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:49.040]   it was me but no be we we had the only place that you know they play break room was in
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.800]   the basement of the McDonald's so you would you would go down in the oh my god it's really
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:59.360]   raining yeah that's how it sounded like in the break room yeah I'm actually moving inside
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.440]   now this is not good thing off I'm not getting these are my last words I'm playing nearer
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.640]   my god today and putting the infant into the lifeboats I've had a big speak well of me when
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.400]   you speak of me goodbye make sure you throw the big sapphire off the deck before you go
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:21.200]   hey you know it's funny I think AT&T views this is kind of we're gonna do some viral marketing
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.520]   and show people but but you do raise the important point Scott that people do need to get or maybe
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.000]   it was you Alex people really do need to get ready for this because it's gonna be a lot
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.080]   to do this gets into that hole I mean we think about traffic you know just people putting
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.760]   their brakes on just a little bit can create like a mile long traffic on the same way having
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.280]   people be able to order their phone quickly means that they're all out of the way and we
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.240]   get the by ours except when we ever we actually go in I'm not I don't think I'm gonna go the
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.960]   first day don't you think you know I'm gonna cover people on the first day you know we'll
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.200]   shoot people going on the first day but I don't think I'm I think I'm gonna wait I don't know
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.520]   if there's gonna be people in line at this point will there be will there be that crazy
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:03.920]   line to get into the iPhone store that there was last year or yet this time last year I
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.880]   know in San Francisco the thing people learned was that they could walk in later yeah you
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.440]   walked in three hours later and it was they were plenty of phones the only thing they'll
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.320]   run out is the 16 gig because no one's gonna be it no one's gonna buy an 8 gig well let's
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:21.280]   see there's a few more things Todd would like to let us know so make sure we have everything
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.440]   have all our ducks in a row go ahead Todd speak to us before you ever come to a store
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:32.320]   will save us all a lot of time and make it so check out at.com forward slash iPhone and
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.440]   look at the rate plans and pick one that works best for you if you travel overseas be sure
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.960]   to check out our international rate plans and review our travel tips second before July
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.240]   11th you can get a credit check out of the way by visiting the store where you plan to
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.960]   purchase oh there's a good tip go to the store now to get your credit check done.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:23:00.040]   Oh useful and third backup any data that's on your current phone that you want to put
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   on your iPhone 3G. Oh that's easy to do back up your phone you know how to back up your
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.560]   phone if you do if you have a iPhone yeah but like a regular phone no you can't back
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.800]   up hence the iPhone syncs with applications on your Mac or PC getting your current phones
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.580]   data to a computer is a good move then when you're ready to buy iPhone 3G on or after
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.400]   July 11th you'll need to be sure to bring us some additional information. I love this
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:33.440]   video has all these people laughing they're laughing this is crazy this is all crazy
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:41.120]   it's a phone it's so much fun. All right I think we've had enough of Todd and his his
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.320]   maniacal plans for iPhone it was just getting good. Oh you want more you want more all right
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.800]   what one more one more here we go here we go setting up a new account.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:54.680]   Since you're opening a new account we need a photo ID and your social security number
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.160]   since you're a new customer will need to run a quick credit check again this is one thing
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:04.200]   you can do in advance. Depending on several factors we may require a deposit to establish
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:10.160]   service you'll also have a thirty six dollar activation fee. Next we'll be ready to transfer
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.120]   or port your existing phone number to your new iPhone 3G but to do that we'll need your
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.440]   existing account information as it's on record. Please bring your bill. A lot of that information
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.840]   is usually contained in your bill from your wireless company and so if you can bring in
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:30.240]   that bill that will help us a lot. Specifically we'll need your account number the name of
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.060]   the account holder your mother's made the address for the account the account holder
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:40.560]   social security number or tax ID and if there is one that accounts pin or password.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:47.120]   I think I figured it out what's that I think I figured it out Apple does not have any iPhones
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.200]   to sell they broke their ship date they're not going to be available till October they
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.280]   know what's going to happen to the stock price if they announce the delay so they're
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.040]   just making sure that there's absolutely no way that anybody walks out of that store
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.920]   with a phone. I'm glad I'm playing a gig in Chicago I'm not anywhere near my Apple store.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:10.560]   Each one of those boxes contains a fun sized Snickers bar and back. It is funny the way
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.880]   that that flies in the face of the kind of user experience you can expect being a user
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.880]   where I mean like any anybody who follows the kind of UX world is going to say well gosh
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.120]   it seems like you really want to find a way to break this down as much as possible into
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.840]   at most what we used to call a one-pager. This should be something with like three or
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.720]   four bullets on it and like big graphical icons and you show them this one you should
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.920]   not have to like I just listen to all those videos and like we made a couple jokes that's
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.960]   a ridiculous amount of information process. We're not done and there's more and the other
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.840]   thing is that I mean what they could be doing here is they could let you buy the do
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.800]   all of the entire purchase process online. Set it all up and all you got to walk in and
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:54.520]   do is show them some kind of barcode or your in your ID and pick up the phone and have it
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.880]   activated. Now remember though last last time when we had the activation problems and everybody
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.760]   screamed and moaned and acted like babies were being killed on the doorstep of the bank
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:10.600]   you know this is what you get you get a half hour estimated transaction time for each person
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:16.000]   in the store according to AT&T a half hour. Yeah that's going to run real smooth. Well
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.520]   how many employees are they going to put in place for this because I mean a half point
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.480]   seven million per store. Let's go take that. So if you see a line if you see a line of
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.760]   a hundred people out in front of that Apple store that means it's going to be 50 hours
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:35.400]   of process 50 man hours. So he's trying to get in to process. Well so here's what you
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.120]   should so you're saying half an hour is a reasonable amount of time to plan. That's what
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.600]   they're saying. So you should to see count the number of people in front of the store
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.880]   divide that number of people by the number of employees you see inside the store who
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.240]   are actually at the counter. Well Apple doesn't have counters or they don't need counters.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.400]   You know they walk around with a little can they active now but can where can they activate
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.680]   you from? I bet you I bet you Apple I don't know about AT&T but I bet you Apple would
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.640]   be pretty far ahead of it. I mean I would have to buy the Apple store. I think the Apple
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.680]   store is going to be an easier place to buy a phone. I bet I bet money that it'll go
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.800]   faster at the Apple store. It sure has had everyone to be nicer. They'll actually know
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:14.240]   what they're talking about. But Todd won't be there. That's true. I don't know. So why
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.160]   is an Apple doing all these videos? If he knows what's good for him Todd won't be there.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.280]   It'll be swarmed. Wait a minute I know that voice. It'll be swarmed. But why is an Apple
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.520]   putting out these videos? They're doing good car best. They're doing good cop bed cop.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.480]   I mean if you're Apple would you happily pass this along to AT&T? You do that. You have them
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:36.440]   associated with that. Yeah well they did a good job. I can just see the shoulder shug
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:42.640]   right now. Was it me? I got another new one. My guess is that AT&T was the one that wanted
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.160]   to do all this activation in store and Apple just said well it's your problem. You know
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:53.880]   if you do the... Well you know why this is happening because AT&T is subsidizing the
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.880]   phone. They need to have you activate because they're getting all the money now. This is
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.840]   important to them. And once again a little bit in their defense I have been at like in
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.160]   a Verizon store watching people trying to get a new phone and there's a lot of confusion.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.000]   It's probably smart that they know which way or not. I think this is actually a pretty
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.800]   good proactive way to get people ready to go because there's people come in without
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.640]   you know after lobotomy with their phone and they're trying to figure out how to move
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.120]   the stuff from here to here and the phone six years old and they can't figure out how
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.040]   to get the data off but they're committed to getting the data off. Well frankly this
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.560]   is why I use an independent phone store with guys I know I buy a lot of phones from them.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.440]   They know me. It's not as crowded. They can do all this but they can't sell me an iPhone.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.680]   They're striving them crazy by the way. They would love to sell iPhones and they'd make
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:43.520]   it a better customer experience I think. Okay well there we go. Any other price information
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.360]   that we should know ahead of time Scott Bournum and there seems like there's a lot of hidden
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:52.320]   stuff. Yeah there's an extra 15 a month if you want to get some of the enterprise features.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:59.920]   So be prepared for that. Like what? Like I think the active sync stuff. You're kidding.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:06.120]   I mean I mean I'm not exactly sure what it includes but it's the enterprise account
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.000]   and they're saying it's 45 a month minimum for that. I'm not buying one of these. I just
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.480]   decided I'd look twenty dollars a month for a. Okay so you pay you're paying sixty bucks
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.480]   a month you get five hundred minutes unlimited data but if you want any text messages you
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.640]   got to buy them twenty bucks another twenty bucks if you want to buy unlimited text messages.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.800]   So that's eighty bucks a month just for the data and five hundred minutes if you want a
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.280]   reasonable plan you're going to be spending a hundred bucks a month plus the twenty bucks.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.240]   That's under twenty bucks a month for this phone. That's what I was paying for my trio
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.800]   so I don't know. Well that's what AT&T's excuse is as they say well this is what this
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.560]   makes it on a par with every other smartphone. And I got no problem with that. The thing
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:49.680]   is though is they're misrepresenting it as being cheaper. Yeah it's a little I don't
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.400]   know. I mean they're saying that iPhone is cheaper now. There's the iPhone is not a
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.160]   lie it's cheaper now. Yeah yeah you know it over the life yeah not over the life of the
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:03.160]   phone but but you know what do people pay attention to what they pay attention to what
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.920]   they're going to pay. I think it's a great marketing move people will say yeah I got
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.080]   a hundred ninety nine bucks no problem but you know it's sort of like people that buy
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.360]   a car with nothing down and then the first monthly payment comes due and they go oops.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.880]   Now I think a lot of people I say say this every time but I really think it's important
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.880]   I tell everybody who I talk to a lot of people come up to me say should I buy an iPhone and
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.120]   I say first check to see if you're going to get 3G if you're well you're there's only
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:32.200]   really two big new features right it's 3G and it's the GPS. And the GPS isn't like a
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:37.680]   turn by turn GPS you could there are plenty of fun. Well not well we don't know if ever
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.640]   right now. But this is but this GPS is not going to be the sort of thing you put in
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.720]   your car and use as a dash navigate. That's what I'm saying. It's going to be the sort
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.880]   of thing that gives you local results automatically that gives you site specific Twitter automatically
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.760]   that basically tells you oh by the way this email from this contact he's actually within
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.520]   walking distance if you want to ask that's cool in the face. Yeah that's that's why I'm
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:01.320]   getting these GPS. There's that new kind of Twitter local Twitter I can remember it's
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.480]   NWLP or something where it it no it tells you you can only chat you can chat with everybody
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.440]   within a nine block radius of you regardless you know friends or followers it says nothing
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.840]   like that. So that kind of thing would be great on the iPhone. Right. It knows exactly
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.520]   where you are I would say here's who's in nine blocks radius here's where the parties are.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.360]   And I just think that with the with the SDK I think the ability to develop for this is
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.200]   going to be to develop. If they like it. Well you they can't do turn by turn but you can
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.080]   do a lot of other things that are location based I think that they're going to be very
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   interesting. What is it Jeff? Is it Twinkle? Is that the twinkle? Is that the one you know
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:40.160]   it's on hack? No yeah that's one on hack fun but there's a new it's not Twitter based.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.320]   It's it's filtering everywhere even halo the new version of halo is location aware it's
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.320]   ready for that as soon as it's ready for now you actually have to type in your address.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.280]   So with halo are you gonna just you actually instead of like saying walk forward you just
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:59.440]   run down the street screaming like a maniac. Yeah. You're holding your iPhone and going
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.760]   just holding your iPhone like a like a like a 50 caliber just going that would actually
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:08.160]   be pretty good. I'd be good exercise. It's like you played no video game. That would
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.480]   be that would be awful. That would be a bad bad day for lots and lots of people and I
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:20.280]   don't condone it. Thank you Andy and I said Andy not go. The voice of reason. I can't
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.620]   remember I you know I said another one of those things you know I I I I look at friend
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:29.000]   feed and this stream of information is more information than is raining on your head right
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.800]   now Andy and and I and I know I saw somewhere it's within a nine block radius you could
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.920]   to basically it's like Twitter but only but but but only people who are running this application
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.120]   on their iPhone within a nine block radius of you but that's the way this GPS works which
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:51.840]   is that it turns on says we're you know periodically because otherwise it killed the battery. Oh
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.480]   I know where I am now. Okay and then turns itself off and we don't know what the periodicity
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.160]   is of it but it's probably less 30 seconds or a minute. It's not enough to give you a
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.040]   turn by turn direction. Well I mean I know that just the current triangulation with the
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.560]   Wi-Fi and it's pretty good. It has been has been good enough that I've used it quite a bit
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.840]   when I'm lost and and I would love to have the precision. I mean that's for me that's
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:15.240]   enough I'll buy it just just to have that. So but I think also the API for the GPS is
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.480]   really really clever in that it will only if the developer says look I don't need to
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.040]   know within you know nuclear missile targeting precision I just need to know generally where
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.680]   this guy is it will just power up just enough electronics to get that sort of a fix it will
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.960]   only power up the GPS if it specifically is asked for that kind of precision that's kind
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.720]   of clever. Well anyway so there's absolutely good location based stuff but it's not the
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.280]   GPS that you might many people think they're getting that does come with other phones like
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:50.640]   the sprint instinct which has turn by turn GPS and the HSDPA that AT&T is doing the 3G
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.280]   network is far from available everywhere. So the two reasons that a lot of people are
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.840]   going to buy that phone I think they may be a little disappointed when they get the phone
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:03.280]   home and say oh I'm not getting high speed and I don't know where I am. I'm interested
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.480]   in this so the audio thing that Steve's talking about to improved audio I mean for for me
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.720]   these little speakers and of course obviously with my ringtones it makes a big difference
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   but do you think it's better speakers or it's a better cell phone audio in other words
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:23.440]   is the better transmitter in there. Well it's got to be better be better speakers I mean
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.240]   I can't see how you can make it sound anything sound good to those same speakers. People
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.280]   have complained although consumer reports I think gave it pretty good review but people
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.680]   complained about the audio quality of the original iPhone that when people when you talk
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:40.400]   to people on the iPhone or for a little for a little as anybody knows that. Well I don't
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.160]   think it's any different than my trio was or I think they're all crappy. I mean yeah
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.560]   I think they're all poor in that regard so I don't I don't look for any big change there
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:52.280]   I'm just wondering you know how the plastic case will do as far as reception the theory
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.520]   being that the plastic case will allow better reception than the steel case on the back.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.880]   If it works in my office I'll be happy. So the as the iPhone that works in your office
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:07.200]   it's got to have a nuclear antenna. I always every time someone calls I have to walk over
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.800]   to the window and like open the window and stick my head out to make sure that it works
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:18.200]   and then I think oh I really wish Verizon had iPhones. AT&T less bars everywhere. Who needs
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:24.320]   bars but if you want to go to a bar you know the AT&T motto don't you know what's it what's
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:29.960]   we're not happy till you're not happy or as Lily Tomlin used to say we don't care we don't
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.760]   have to we're the phone company. But I think this is a cultural problem I think this is
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.640]   why people are having a hard time getting caught up with the iPhone is that I mean I
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.120]   had the same opinion about Verizon you go to a Verizon store and it's about as bad a customer
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.920]   service experiences you can as as I've had almost anywhere and so you know it's just
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.040]   phone companies are not used to that it's a commoditized thing people walk in they get
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.560]   their phone there's no you know and so I think that a lot of other no matter how good these
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:59.440]   phones get until it makes they make it easy and and enjoyable to buy one I think it's
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.000]   gonna be a hard time they're gonna have a hard time catching up. If you thought it was
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:10.520]   bad here in the States the people there's actually a website FU Rogers in Canada. Does
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:16.160]   that mean Frank you Rogers? Yes yes I'll let you guys spell it out in your heads but if
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.600]   you go there actually it takes you it takes you to another site but there's a petition
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.760]   online because the roc it's ruined iPhone dot com get you to the same site the Rogers
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:34.640]   plans are so god awful if for I think it's for 60 bucks you the top you get something
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:43.000]   like a hundred minutes and 400 megabytes a month 400 it's ridiculous. So for any decent
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.400]   plan you're spending well over a hundred bucks let me just check the the plans here
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:53.000]   because they have it linked from that site. What's so ironic is that you know at the blog
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.200]   we probably get more and have gotten more email from Canada saying we weren't a
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.200]   phone. Well they wanted it badly yeah I know I'm saying they are the most vocal group of
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.760]   people who have wanted it and now they don't want it. Well it's not that they don't want
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.640]   it huh. Is Wi-Fi more available in Canada like especially Toronto and stuff I mean you
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.400]   think people we get on. Yeah actually Toronto has a municipal Wi-Fi through Toronto Hydro
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.560]   so maybe that's it. So here's what you get for 60 bucks which is what we're paying for
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:29.360]   our unlimited data plan you get 150 minutes and a maximum of 400 megabytes download and
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.760]   then what a text message you get 75. You get 75 text messages which should be enough for
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:39.840]   anybody I think except for I just need. Yeah I was about to say don't don't. That's two
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:45.520]   whole text messages a day. What are you gonna do guys come on for a hundred bucks you get
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:51.400]   600 minutes see right there the minutes are already terrible 600 minutes a gigabyte of
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:57.400]   data max 200 messages the top is a hundred fifteen dollars you get 800 minutes this is
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:03.600]   the top plan they offer and the max data is two gigabytes in a month. There's gonna be
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.480]   some big cell phone bills up there in Canada. Can you imagine I mean they're really very
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.240]   upset there's no unlimited data there's no unlimited text messages. Rogers have much of
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:19.120]   any do they have any competition up there. Yeah there's tell us right Roger Zones Fido
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.960]   they merged with the other the other there's Bell there's there's so they do have competition
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.840]   then yeah but it's just like here there's not actually it's a lot worse in here there's
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.440]   I think there's three right maybe there's two because they could think so they sold out
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.680]   so people who are very excited in Canada about getting the iPhone now are very disappointed
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:43.600]   and I think that this ruined iPhone dot com they have 27,000 signatures. Could a petition
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.440]   really make could could it do something? Ted Rogers doesn't care he's doing just fine
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:54.840]   thank you he this is the problem is they have a lock essentially. Yeah and so we complain
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.600]   but I want to make sure that everybody understands that we still have it better than than Canada
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.680]   and many other countries frankly. Where American Dids are right to complete. Yeah
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:11.000]   right. Ten point five point four came out on Monday downloaded it noticed absolutely nothing
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.840]   wasn't very big sixty four megabytes they were some security rolled up some security patches
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.600]   didn't look like any new ones. A lot of bug fixes anybody have any problems with 10.54
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.800]   Alex it worked okay for you. I didn't update. You don't put it on your machines because
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.840]   you got production. I just wait I usually I'm usually an upgrade behind or or this would
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.320]   be one where wouldn't there would be probably not a lot of urgency because it looks like
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.680]   all the security patches at least all the ones they claim are in 10.54 or have already come
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:43.240]   out now is it and now has the have they patched or worked on it with a R.D. the A.R.D. patch
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.880]   that's it's they fixed the problem with the Adobe networking thing that was causing people
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.000]   to have trouble when they tried to send a Photoshop files over a network that's one
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.200]   of the they did fix they were getting corrupted right corrupted on the way and they all and
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.320]   that was the only real problem with the last one and then there is also some new camera
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:06.040]   raw profiles there as far as I know was no fix for the A.R.D. agent this is the remote
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.520]   access Trojan horse we thought we got hit by it what we thought we had been hit by it
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.360]   in the office and it turned out it was just one of our was someone who not not working
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.160]   in the office but she she works actually in Toronto and she suddenly noticed her mouse
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:26.160]   moving on its own you know and and and thought and her A.R.D. was open which actually was
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.320]   the the hint that it might not be that when you actually turn A.R.D. on there's a bunch
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.000]   of other security stuff that comes in the place so if you have it on your system which
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.720]   everybody does but you're not using it the your risk and so but it turned out to be a
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:44.440]   wackum tablet that was had the pen too close to the kind of phantom too close in the present.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.320]   Rob Griffith writing in the Macworld magazine says the most significant thing about what's
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:55.640]   changed in OS 1054 maybe what hasn't changed the A.R.D. agent security hole discovered a
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:01.040]   few weeks ago remains unplugged and that and he says and I think he's right they've
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:07.520]   been working on this a long time long before the hole was announced or discovered so I
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.120]   think you're going to see as Rob says I agree you're going to see a standalone update
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:16.320]   meanwhile one thing you can do is move the A.R.D. agent file out of your system folder
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.520]   zip it up put it somewhere so it doesn't activate you won't have access to her if you're using
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.680]   her own access leave it on I guess right right and if you're not using it take it out and
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.920]   zip it up but it appears that the safer thing to do if you're if you're going to use it
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.840]   on an office to leave it on and then turn security features on or choose those things rather
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.120]   than leaving it just completely off.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:42.120]   PDF related utilities updated mail PDF save as PDF X save PDF to Weber seats folder workflows
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:48.040]   there was a lot of you know it's a lot of those little mini mini fixes you know that's
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:54.640]   what this is all about you know it wasn't that big apple dictionary was updated to include
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.120]   the word mobile me.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   Dude.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.120]   You think I'm kidding.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.760]   No I just I just think it's it's terribly funny they've got this sucky name and they
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.200]   had to put it in their own dictionary to try to validate it go to dictionary and look
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.600]   up mobile me it says and Internet service from apple incorporated for Macintosh computers
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.440]   iPhone iPod touch and PCs.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.520]   I would recommend it was recommended for all users.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.520]   Exactly.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.640]   But not for that reason.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.320]   We you have some news from Europe on that Leo.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   Oh yes.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.720]   The French version is called mobile moi.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.960]   Is it just kidding.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.360]   Probably moi mobile.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.680]   I like that moi mobile.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.080]   That has a more je ne sais quoi to it.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.080]   Yes.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.560]   Which means I have no I don't know what.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.120]   So you're safe saying I had more I don't know what.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.520]   I know enough French to get arrested let's put it like that.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.840]   So do we all I think thanks to the lady marmalade.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.120]   Let's see I don't see anything new I haven't had any problems I did install it on a couple
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:02.040]   of machines it seems to be working all right I think it's probably worth applying but not
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.880]   urgent because again the security fix that most people want at this point is that ARD
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.680]   agent and that is not included.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:12.560]   I always wait on these updates I always feel like in the middle of a project and then I
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.400]   update it just almost reminds me of those days in the OSA no S seven you know where you
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.480]   got these extensions and if you put one in the wrong order and messes everything up I
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:26.760]   lost a lot of plugins on logic pro back on the 10 3 or is it 10 2 the one that was really
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.760]   problematic.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.920]   I just pulled my hair on so I was they backed can you are using them now or.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:37.080]   They're there but they're still there they're still gone they're not they had a special
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.600]   folder for all these cool legacy plugins the plugins are there it's just they were bundled
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.760]   in a nice little folder in my plugins thing and logic and now they're they're gone so
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.480]   I know how to get to them but it was kind of frustrating to see them disappear for no
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.680]   reason right right.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.400]   Yeah I'm using OS three because that's safe.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.520]   You know I find six to be very stable.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.440]   You know OS six was was a very stable and even remember OS six.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.120]   Yeah I mean system six system six I remember I held out for a long time system seven came
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.000]   out and there was a you could have two windows you could have.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.040]   I think two applications open at the same time on system seven and and that was a pretty
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.520]   exciting but I you know I like my stable platform.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.040]   If you wait to update I mean okay I've noticed that they'll come out with these pro app updates
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:29.680]   you know and I think what I did maybe is is updated a pro app one and I should have done
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.680]   it before I updated the OS app.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.680]   Is that possible?
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.200]   Yeah you can definitely break things badly I mean because a lot of the pro apps will
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.760]   be updated to assuming that typically it's quick time that needs to be caught up with
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:47.320]   the pro app because the all the pro apps sit on top of quick time and and and constantly
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.720]   are checking back with it so usually those get upgraded together or a quick time may get
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.160]   updated independently but when you get it when you get an update for pro app it's very
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:59.040]   often you'll have an update for a quick time because they're they work kind of hand in
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.040]   hand.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:04.200]   Yeah I usually update quick time but then I always wait for the pro apps just in case
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:09.240]   I completely screw everything up and then so maybe maybe for me it's all or nothing just
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.240]   update all the time.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.240]   Well I don't I the quick time ones are actually when they come out by themselves I tend to
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.080]   be kind of careful about it because sometimes you'll update quick time and it'll break because
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:22.480]   everything's sitting on it if the if the other apps aren't updated some suddenly you know
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:28.160]   final cuts doing you know funky exports or you know that type of thing so.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.040]   Quick time is the one we're actually the most careful with I think of all of them were constantly
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.520]   afraid because that's the one that's most often updated and it was the one we we kind
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.920]   of wait we watch we look around we wait to see if people on the final cut forums are
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.040]   are freaking out and if no one freaks out it's kind of it's kind of like that wilder
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.240]   beast that's walking towards the water and you watch a couple of them walk to the water
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.560]   no you want to walk to the water and you're just like you're like did he make it did he
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.400]   make it and then once he makes it then you can walk over and you must be dying about
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.960]   what's going on in Zimbabwe and then it's you know it's something that has to happen
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.600]   I mean you know it's look obvious just well it the process they just have to get through
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.360]   it you know and so it's kind of that what you've been sick for a long time and then
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.480]   you're throwing up and right now that that's going on but I'm hopefully I'm going to be
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.600]   there in September so when you were you brought me some Zimbabwe dollars back there was much
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.040]   less than they were there in place I have one in my office I have one in my office it's
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.800]   50 million yeah and but now it was worth it when I got it it was worth a dollar and now
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.800]   it's it's worth like you know 10 cents or or something like that it's like five billion
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.320]   a they said their inflation rates one million percent a year oh no no no no I think it's
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.000]   more now I think it's actually celebrated it's crazy the company there's a company in
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.920]   Germany I was just reading this in the Wall Street Journal is a company in Germany that
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.480]   stopped sending the water they stopped they stopped it's the paper because the German
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.960]   government kept putting pressure on them they would they would send the paper with no like
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.320]   blank a blank check yeah they have all the holographs and all the you know anti-counterfeit
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.720]   stuff but then there's no number on it and or it had one number but then they they could
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:56.240]   add the zero government could add the zeros depending on what they needed yeah well it's
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:01.120]   changing it changes so fast I mean it's you know lunch will be you know half a billion
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.440]   dollars today and and a billion dollars tomorrow and and it's but if you bring American hard
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.680]   currency you're from an American's point of view from Americans point of view with with your
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.600]   it's the it's actually there's actually been deflation lunches less expensive now than
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.160]   it was when I started going there well they're glad to get hard currency yeah hard currency
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.600]   is very valuable there so you you typically when you when you run into an ex when you run
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.200]   into something where you need to handle something you having hard currency solves it quickly
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.280]   hey we're gonna take a break unless there's any other news stories let me ask anybody
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:36.360]   have other news stories before we go to our picks of the week going once going twice all

[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:14.280]   the fans of Matlock I love Andy Griffith though not Andy Griffith I was I think I think he was
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:21.800]   funny when he was when he was wearing a badge myself that's all Andy it's and be I recognize

[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.160]   it's fun it's really it's a like you know sometimes you want something very funny
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:24.840]   sometimes you want something serious they actually have if you go to the top of the page
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.280]   they're doing and I this is actually something Alex would like the American history timeline
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:35.240]   and I've listened to a lot of history books on audible.com and one that I'm that I've been
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:42.760]   listening to a lot of is commonwealth economics for a crowded planet by Jeffrey Sachs oh cool and
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:47.800]   it's actually really good and and it's it's kind of this very soft way to introduce you to lots of
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.080]   global like macro economics oh see that'll be great while talking about so he's talking about
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:56.360]   the problem of you know Zimbabwe of all the issues around crowding and and resources everything
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:02.200]   else but as he's talking about it you really get a lot of macro back about macro economic
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:08.200]   you know a lot about macro biotic you see there's yin and then there's yang and there's local food
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:13.160]   and then there you know but uh but it's uh anyway it's it's very good cool what is that called common
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:17.080]   wealth commonwealth it's it's called commonwealth economics for a crowded planet by Jeffrey Sachs
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:22.120]   and I got one too Leo wow we're going crazy go ahead scott bourn it's the Spartans
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:27.480]   still reading that are we see I skipped it so scott I think scott scott
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:32.360]   scott felt unbalanced because I you know he was expecting the Spartans and he felt like he wasn't
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.680]   he it wasn't gonna be he wasn't getting into your yang I guess yeah I mean I know I want my third
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.640]   pass with the Spartans so it's I like it I just read it over and over again that's the first time
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:46.200]   in my life I've heard Alex Lindsey give a audible pick that wasn't the Spartans
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:54.760]   all right and the reason he gives the Spartans is because it's 957 hours long so it just he has to
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:52:01.000]   keep giving that every week you get through it that's right audible.com a u d i b l e.com slash

[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:33.240]   of all the junk on my computer so I really like these two little apps are kind of two so maybe
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.400]   I'm cheating I don't know but no you're always welcome to do to that's fine I've got a zilly
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:43.960]   what size you guys use that it's what size well Merlin I have used that but you know kind of
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:51.320]   in morning of an allegorical manner is this a program yes it's called what size and it's at
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:58.200]   the URL there is id dash design.com oh so you measure stuff on the screen right and it and you
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:03.720]   can do it in a pie chart or whatever and for some reason stuff always ends up that I didn't know I
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:09.080]   had there so it a lot of times when I'm doing manual cleaning of my computer I'm like well why is
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   my hard drive only got two gigabytes left what's going on here so I type it in and it says well
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:18.840]   you've got all this audio that you know because iTunes is famous for doubling things so and then
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.320]   I use this other little thing called app zapper if I've forgotten that I downloaded some program
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:29.240]   that I never use and I just want to quickly get rid of it and I see it that it's sitting there
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:33.880]   um app zapper.com is awesome it's like this little un-uninstaller and I just drag it in.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.040]   That's a good one. So those two are like little buddies like one of them and say go here's all
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:42.040]   the junk on your computer and then I go okay cool and if it's an app I throw it in an app zapper
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:46.920]   and it's gone and I can feel that. I was a musician because then my software would be little buddies
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:53.560]   too. You are a musician. Well not like him. I don't like do it for a living. Hey I've heard you play
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:57.560]   the guitar you don't have to do it for a living but you're a great musician. Oh thank you. You can
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.360]   have little buddies. Okay I do think that's cool a little I never heard that Jeff congratulations.
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:08.200]   Oh okay. My little buddy. My little buddy. That's because he's from Nashville. My little buddy there.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:13.320]   Actually that's software buddies. Nice little buddy. Yeah there you go. Did you guys have Waffle
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.080]   House is still in Nashville. Absolutely there's one up the road for my house. Come on down.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.640]   Well Waffle is now. I think we should have a tradition. No no no no it's the raisin toast at
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:27.640]   Waffle House man. That's what you go for the raisin toast. Can't get anywhere. Just for a moment
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:32.760]   when you go to Waffle House and order toast. It does but I just say give me all the raisin toast in
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:37.960]   the house and they know they're just they hear and flow flow will give it to you. Yeah and there is
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:41.880]   a woman named flow at every single Waffle House. It's a rule. Wow.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.320]   It's code for something we don't know yet.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:54.200]   Saving that for the so-called phase three of Waffle House operations. Pray that we don't
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:55:00.920]   survive to learn what that is. Andy and I go let's get your pick before the clouds burst once again.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:07.480]   Yes okay well the BK Steakhouse burger features a clean broil steak burger.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:13.560]   This is not nice. I'm hungry. Of melted American cheese. You are a one thick and hearty steak sauce
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:18.920]   crispy onions red ripe tomatoes crisp lettuce and creamy mayonnaise on a premium bakery bun
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:23.160]   and I think you all agree with me that the BK Steakhouse burger delivers a whoop and
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:27.960]   lot of satisfaction for just a suggested retail price of three dollars seventy nine cents.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:32.600]   Are you doing side deals? Well that's not my pick that's not my pick of the week.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:38.680]   Was that a little side deal you got going there with the game?
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:43.720]   No no no just stick with me here because you know my pick of the week is the Burger King Gold Card.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:50.120]   Now I only heard about this when I heard that Hugh Laurie once mentioned in an interview a
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:54.600]   couple weeks ago that there is the ultimate celebrity perk is the special gold card that
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:59.480]   Burger King promotions will give you that allows you to get free burgers and any Burger King for
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:03.960]   life. What? And there are only there are only about 12 people on this list. Hugh Laurie has one
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.040]   Hugh Laurie mentioned it and they said oh well of course Hugh we'd love to give you one here have
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.840]   a BK Gold Card. Jay Leno has one George Lucas has one. You mean when I went out of this work you
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:17.080]   just pull up at the store and you flash a card and now give you your food? Well they have to see
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:21.000]   they have well they finally should ask Burger King it's a way to promote Burger King's wonderful
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.920]   Pay It Your Way program by which you can put cash onto these special debit cards. You just
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:30.520]   try to get a gold card and have and have all the convenience of cash with all the flexibility
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.920]   of your favorite BK menu. Andy if you get a gold card will you take us out can you get
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:39.480]   other people food with this gold card? Well that's not up to me that's up to a woman by the name of
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:45.320]   Shari Costa the senior manager of the Burger King Pay It Your Way program. Who I should mention is
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:51.160]   light is a gazelle on her feet. She eats like a bird. Love the time. Regular regular blood donor
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:58.600]   returns her library books on time and my email address is you can just go to hit on down to cwob.com
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:03.960]   you know like this sort of keep this it's just genuine well spring support. I mean you can't hear
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:07.160]   this but I'm actually tapping some Burger King french fries against the microphone right now
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:11.400]   that's how much big a fan I am of Burger King and all of its fine fine products actually
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:17.320]   underneath my hat I'm usually wearing one of those paper Burger King browns. The BK Stake
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:22.840]   Hot Burger at prison spending franchises. This makes anything to Vorac is ever done to self-promote
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:28.440]   look like it was amateurish. And if it wins it'll be 1000 times more awesome than the
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:33.400]   Vor ever fantasize about. So seriously there is this card that if you're a celebrity
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:39.960]   if you're a celebrity again basically the again you get these special like like little debit cards
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:43.320]   and you can you normally just you know put cash on it to give it to your kids but there's never
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:48.120]   gets. But this one basically says that anything this guy wants if he wants the entire store if he
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:52.200]   wants the fiberglass Burger King outside the front give it to him he's up there with Jay Leno and
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:57.240]   Hugh Laurie and George Lucas who does not want to be in a club that features just 12 people one of
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:02.600]   whom is George Lucas. That would never be George Lucas had a Burger King I've seen him at McDonald's.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:07.320]   I'd be honest with you I think getting one of these things would basically be a death sense.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:13.160]   Oh but what a way to die. That would happily be like one of the top I had one of the first
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:17.880]   paragraph items in my obituary he was a member of the ultra exclusive Burger King Gold Club
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:22.840]   a club that included Dr. House and George Lucas and he died broiled not fried.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:27.720]   Boy bro not fried. What we have to well now what hey okay that's an interesting question if you could
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:35.400]   get such a card. I don't think I I'd like prefer the Waffle House would be better than the Burger King.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:39.080]   Give me the cinnamon raisin toast covered yeah they don't they don't cinnamon
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:45.160]   bark. They don't flame broiled those waffles Leo the the searing carbon goodness that flame broiled
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:51.720]   deals in the juices while locking in the meaty freshness. I don't know I think I'd still rather
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:57.560]   have the waffle house. Don't you dare screw the stuff. I'm sorry. You're right Burger King fantastic
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:02.120]   fist of an angry god. I love Burger King actually the wiper jr is a mighty fine burger.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:08.440]   Okay well wait a little wait a little wait a little she stops listening and then we can
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:14.040]   think we can go on. Mel's a beginner. You know I actually you said Mel's uh Mel's
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:19.720]   diner in San Francisco. Believe it or not Dvorak and I when we did a radio show in the early 90s we
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:24.840]   had Mel's cater it every Sunday. Mel's would bring I didn't know they catered. Well it was especially
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:29.240]   it was like an ad deal or something. I'm not our syndicator arranger. We get a tray of
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:34.280]   Rubens. I mean it was literally I'm so glad it stopped because it would just kill you. You'd be
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:39.880]   dead if you kept eating like that. What was very good. Chopped liver. I mean it was a ton of stuff
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:47.800]   until frack. You know he was just. It was free food. It wasn't gonna walk away. I mean.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:53.800]   Scott born what's your is that all you want to say about that any anything else you'd like to get
[00:59:53.800 --> 01:00:01.000]   in there? Uh also I mean that new dress that you have on Shari it takes years off and that means
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.480]   that you're what 17 18 because there wasn't that many years to start off. Beautiful. Beautiful one.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.400]   Yeah. Exactly. Lovely. Lovely. Lovely soul. That's what I'm trying to get at.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.480]   On the looks can fade not that her is will but she's got a beautiful soul on the inside.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:18.440]   I understand she's building homes for habitat for humanity right now somewhere. That's gorgeous.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.440]   That's the kind of person she is donating blood with one arm while she's hammering in dry well with
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:30.360]   the other arm. God bless you lady. Uh Scott born. Oh thanks for letting me follow that.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.760]   Um you want me to do you want me to do one like a buffer zone should I be your buffer?
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.960]   No I'm good. I'm ready. I can give you a. It actually works because it's food related almost.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:46.360]   Oh good. All right. It's called cocktail. Mm my pick is cocktail and this is an odd tick for a
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:52.840]   guy like me. Um but I actually got it when my networking guy was trying to help me tweak my
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:59.320]   TCP receive and send window. Know how that could be. Yeah that's difficult and uh so he said let's
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:05.320]   just get this $14.95 program and we can do all kinds of cool stuff with it and man. I mean I'm
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.920]   sure it's a little dangerous in my hands because it let's you access Unix stuff but they have a
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:16.120]   thing called the pilot that lets you clean up your disk and do all kinds of cool things with OS
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:21.480]   10 you're not you know familiar with maybe and uh I don't have you ever heard of this Leo?
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   Cock cocktail. Yeah I have it. I use it. Okay so you know I'm.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.440]   Tastic. But is it free? I can't remember or is it 1495? That's what I thought. Okay cool.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.640]   This is a new version 4.1.3. I have a truck. It's leopard compatible. So that's why I stopped
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.160]   using it because these are all very specific. All of these little programs are specific to the
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.320]   OS version you're running. Yeah and there is a free trial version maybe you were thinking of that
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.640]   but um you know it does it does all kinds of stuff like you know you can you can just sort of use
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:54.840]   it as a one stop shop to do things like modify your sleep settings, disable journaling,
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:00.840]   you know change your startup mode, force empty your trash which is one of the ones that always
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:07.160]   bugs me. Um you know it's just a bunch of little cool utilities and 15 bucks. Very good deal.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.760]   Yeah I know I could say it in the hands of someone like me it might be three karate listens going
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.560]   up against Bruce Lee but nevertheless I'm having fun with it. So it'll handle fix your TCP when
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:23.480]   if you have a receive problem. Yes my TCP win as you know my doctor's been asking me to get
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:28.760]   something done about that for quite some time. It's plugged up and uh he's taking my TCP win
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:34.760]   TCP win pressure this week. So we'll see. Cocktail what's the uh website for that? That's um
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:42.440]   maintain.se/cocktail. Sweden there's some Sweden. There's some Sweden. Sweden.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:48.120]   Doksi make it. Sweden. Which means thanks a billion and Swedish. My program thank you Scott
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.320]   Born. You're welcome. Is something called Visigami. Have you ever seen this or heard of this? Visigami
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:58.440]   it's from Google. Google has a Google cold lab with some interesting Mac applications they're free.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.200]   It's running right now. It's both an application and a screen saver. In fact I'll show you kids
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.720]   who are those of you who are watching at home. What you do is you give it a keyword it'll pull
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:14.280]   it'll pull pictures um from flicker pakasa or google images based on the keyword.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:18.760]   You could change the speed the spacing the zoom. You could show what kind of display type.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:24.600]   I'm very dangerous. It is very dangerous. I've said it to Burger King because everybody loves
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.800]   Burger King. So what it's doing it's pulling down images from flicker. You have safe search.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:40.040]   Oh god wait a minute. You make an excellent point Alex Lindsay. Well we'll find out.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:45.000]   So this is the this is the screen saver version of it. So these are all Burger King.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.600]   Oh can't move the mouse. Burger King images and so it makes a screen saver out of our desktop
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.720]   application. But I mean obviously you could you could Merlin you could have Eleanor Mann for
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.400]   instance and it would automatically make a screen saver of all the pictures on flicker that you've
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.640]   put up of Eleanor Mann. Very fast, very quick. It's got some very nice transforms. It'll do
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.280]   Ken Burns effects and stuff like that. And it's free called Visigami. That's great. It is from
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:15.320]   a code.google.com I think slash Mac vis V. I S I G A. Am I you'd never it's amazing how many
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.920]   pictures on flicker there are Burger King Burger King. You know there's Shari right there. Look at
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:26.200]   that. She is a lovely woman. Oh god. We've made we said that we're breaking for in this episode
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.600]   and in previous year and a half. I think I think the entire show history actually.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   We're not even done with the show yet. It could be free. Think about how effective
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:40.840]   this is going to be to your target demographic. I'm I'm craving a Whopper junior right now.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:46.280]   But it isn't just whopper juniors is it Andy and I co it can be so much very own heart stopper.

[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:47.640]   I thought he was awfully quiet. Yeah it was it was it was way too quiet for me to trust me.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.840]   Yeah with the Burger King I was expecting some some yeah he had a Colonel panic and said sorry I'm out
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.400]   and he's gone for good. You think? Yeah so that was like 40 minutes ago Leo. I'm glad to see
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.720]   that you're on top of things. I'm busy enjoying the fine programming here on the you're running
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:07.480]   this show and break week. No yeah. He really can't wait to get that wonderful Burger King drive
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:13.480]   through meals convenience as well as affordability and nutrition. Hey Leo another thing last week.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.600]   Yes I wasn't on the show in case you didn't notice. Really? No I wasn't here. Did we call you?
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:28.360]   I don't know. You know frankly I'm in a days almost all the time. I don't really know what's
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:34.360]   going on in the world. Yeah yeah. Remember that million dollars you said you were going to give me
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:42.520]   Yeah right. That I know I didn't say. Let me think who has not Alex Lindsey is your turn my friend.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:47.480]   So I have one that's a little more expensive than the other ones. Uh oh. So this one is about an
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:55.160]   Alex and a half. 1.5 Alex is like a thousand bucks. Yeah 995. And so so here's the here's the problem
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:00.760]   that it solves. It is a little bit more specialized than what we usually talk about but the so when
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.960]   you're doing green screen or you're doing visual effects and you're putting those all the graphics
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:08.280]   together you you very rarely can just pull the green screen and a lot of times you'll have someone
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:13.000]   in a scene and you'll have to get some 3D graphics or something else to go behind them.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.960]   And what you have to do is you have to cut them out of that plate. So you have to draw a little
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:22.840]   line around a person every frame. Yes. And there's a great overview. This is called rotoscoping.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.400]   I was just going to say that sounds like rotoscoping. And there's a great if you do a search for King
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.880]   Kong rotoscope there's a great movie actually with a lot of pixxcal members in it oddly enough.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:40.360]   That highlights what rotoscoping was in King Kong and talks about what rotoscoping actually is.
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:47.480]   And anyway so that's a it's and it's a very specialized but it's used in probably 80%
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:53.240]   maybe even 90 95% of every visual effect shot uses this. And there are very few programs that
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.240]   really do that rotoscoping very well. People can kind of do it. It's a neat effect. Isn't that
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:03.000]   the same effect that waking life waking life is like a it's like a stylized rotoscoping.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.800]   So like this is they film something and then they're drawing on top of it.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.480]   Yes. This is this is very much of a you're not supposed to see it. If a rotoscope artist
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.800]   does their job you don't even know that they're there. That's like intentional rotoscoping.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.680]   Yeah. And you'll really see it as a set if you go if you look at this this it's King Kong
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:22.280]   rotoscoping it's a movie. It's it's like web webisodes or whatever that we're done during the King
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:29.800]   Kong thing and they highlight it. And it is it's very very painstaking. It takes a it takes a long
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.320]   time. So the idea is you're really you're drawing something in but you want to look
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:36.280]   like it's part of the film. Well yeah you're trying to cut something out and put it somewhere
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:41.080]   else. Put something else in and so the thing is that this becomes a very very you really have to
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:44.360]   have a specialized tool because it has to be able to do all these things as efficiently as possible
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:49.720]   because otherwise it's an extremely manual process. And so so anyway there's a program called
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:55.240]   Silhouette Effects that just was updated and it was good before. I mean the older version was
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:01.000]   good but the new version was a huge step forward. I just started really digging myself into it.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.680]   I had it sitting around for a little while and finally dug into it and if if that if you're into
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.440]   effects there's a there's a demo version you can get it activated for 14 days. Even if you just
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:16.600]   want to see what rotoscoping is all about. Download the demo even if you're never going to buy it.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.760]   Download it. That's cool. You can try it for free. Play with it for two weeks. Try to try to cut
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:26.520]   your kids out of a frame. Try to move stuff around. It's a really great way even if you're just going
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:31.080]   to see how movies are made. See how these effects are done. It's worth just downloading and playing
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:36.600]   with a little bit. It is the best in the business right now and so it's a really really great
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.400]   application. So it's called Silhouette Effects Roto I think but it's but the company is Silhouette
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:46.120]   Effects. They've got a bunch of other stuff but that's the one we're talking about today.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:51.560]   Very cool. Some excellent picks from all of you. Now I want to give a little plug here to our friend
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:59.320]   Jeff Smith the Jeff Smith dot com and you can go there and his new album. By the way I love I'm a
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:04.840]   Twitter again. Thank you very much Jeff for that fantastic song. So where do I go on the page if I
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:10.360]   want to find out about the new CD. Do I just go buy this by the CD or are you on the Jeff Smith dot
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.640]   com. Yeah is that the plus place to go? Where should I go or should I use the ringtones?
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:19.720]   Ringtone Feeder is where the pre-release is. Obviously we're trying something. So if you just go to
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.920]   ringtonefeeder.com it is right there on the front page. You click. Can you explain a little bit
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:29.800]   about Ringtone Feeder as long as you're we're talking about it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean we're I got
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:35.400]   an interesting email from a fellow by name Klaus Lovegren who says hi by the way. Hi Klaus.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:42.280]   He had this kind of cool idea to tap my brain you know because I've been doing all these silly
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:47.640]   jingles for you know Adam Curry and Callie Lewis and all these people for a long time and
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.280]   thought it would kind of trans you know become a nice ringtone thing. So but we wanted to try
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:57.960]   something different because there's just a million ringtones out there. So basically this is a RSS
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:03.800]   feed that you subscribe to. It's a premium feed. So for a dollar 98 a month you get
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:09.320]   ringtones added every week. I really I gotta find out more about how you could do a premium RSS
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.160]   feed. So for you pay two bucks a month and you could otherwise you wouldn't get the content.
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.880]   Right. And you could it's not DRM though or anything is it?
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:24.200]   Well it's right now because it's with the iPhone it is the M4R of the Apple iPhone. Now we're
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:29.320]   what's really cool about Ringtone Feeder is that we've like from when we started to where we are
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:34.920]   now we've we've changed so much we're growing we we take we give out polls to our users you know
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:40.280]   help us figure out what you want better. So we've added lots of stuff and when we started you
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:45.800]   subscribed for a buck 98 a month and you got the five latest ringtones that were in the queue and
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.440]   then each week you get one new one. And then and then we decided well you know these are my little
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:54.200]   songs some people like the song some people don't so what else do they like. Let's do some digital
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.080]   instrumental stuff. So now we've doubled it so when you subscribe for dollar 98 a month you get
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:03.240]   10 and then every week you get two more and then some people are like well why does that darn
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.720]   telephone sound in there. So now we've given you two versions one without the telephone sound one
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.960]   with the telephone sound before you know it you're gonna sign up for dollar 98 a month and you get a
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.560]   hundred ringtones. So it's fun you know people are emailing me all the time hey could you make a
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:23.560]   ringtone about my mom you know and and we take all of that. Well one of them is I'm a twit I'm
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.760]   really pleased to say so that's neat. Yeah well you know and when we first went out I shamelessly
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.560]   tried to make a you know a handful of ringtone special for you know for you and some other people
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:39.000]   like that just to kind of you clear through the noise and that was really fun and then of course I
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.280]   found myself people saying hey I want my own personal ringtone and I said I need to wow that's a
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:50.440]   what's cool about it is that it's growing it could be whatever it wants to be. The premium feed is
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:57.800]   pretty cool. I'm such a non-tech guy and basically the artistic person it's a we're a two-man show so
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:06.520]   my buddy Klaus has a you know basically scripted the page and and integrated how you can just sign
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:14.040]   up and then it loads iTunes and this exactly the same thing that's going on with my album
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:21.240]   Ones and O's for this pre-release and the dynamic album so we're using the same premium RSS subscription
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:29.000]   model and then on top of getting the tunes you'll get 12 songs and then a few free ringtones I'm
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.360]   a twit to ringtone I'm a twit video and MPEG-4 is there the and of course all the documentation
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.960]   and lyrics and stuff are embedded in the mp3 the album itself on Ones and O's is completely DRM-free
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:48.760]   it's mp3 it's 256 I think it's a pretty good size for most people 320 might have just been too big
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.040]   probably gonna start loading some other optional things like flack you know if you want if you're
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:59.800]   if you're a paid subscriber to this record there's you can actually go direct download this stuff
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.920]   as well it's a really interesting model I mean to have it be a feed and so that way you get extra
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.920]   stuff kind of automatically do how do people react to it do they react pretty well to them
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:14.040]   I you know we just launched it yesterday I you know I I twitted it and I posted it and people really
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:18.440]   like it obviously some of these tunes have been out in the ether already you know people have heard
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:25.640]   I'm a twit dig the code yeah pod save the queen which was the thing I did for Adam Curry's daughter
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:31.080]   but it and then of course I've packaged it together and just went ahead and embraced the whole geek
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.000]   theme was okay you're you were all in the we're all in the I'm a twit video I just want to point
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.680]   out you got you've got Scott born in there somewhere like there's Peraloa and what I like is in the
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.440]   video you actually I should play the video but in the video you you make it looks like you made it
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:50.600]   all with like uh photobooth yeah you know what's very funny my six year old daughter showed me how
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:55.880]   to record video and photobooth that's how untekky I said look daddy I made a video and she's you know
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.520]   dancing in front of the roller coaster I'm like how did you tell me how did you do it let me let me

[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.760]   a lot of there's a lot of documentation the site's really in detailed everyone seems to
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:12.520]   figure it out and even I figured it out so no you can't do what's your daughter's name
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:18.360]   Molly does she have a lot of videos on YouTube she actually well I wrote a song called Not On
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:23.080]   the Radio a couple years ago that was kind of my intro into the whole podcast kind of world
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:28.840]   and my wife filmed her if you if you go oh I gotta find that oh I gotta find it's the cutest thing
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:32.520]   in the world I actually had nothing to do with the video I was out of town on a gig and then
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.440]   my wife emailed me said hey I made this movie to your song and it's on the internet now and
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.000]   you know next thing you know everyone's playing it Adam Curry's plugging it every you know it's
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.640]   really nice shamelessly using my children to further my career nothing wrong with that I've
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:50.360]   done it for years no actually I would if I could but they haven't they're not
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.640]   now is that was the one with Adam Curry in it the one I should uh

[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:03.800]   uh I think five iPhones to give away with uh audiobooks on them uh I'm gonna firm up those details
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.680]   between now and then but uh and I and we got to think of a way to give them away you know maybe
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:15.080]   having I don't know iPhone costumes or maybe reading uh for you because it's audible books maybe like
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:20.360]   sack races sack races there we go sack race for a phone we'll figure out a way we'll give some of

[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:44.600]   well the good news about the ball is the fine executive chair that I purchased to sit in and
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.240]   I am no longer sitting in could be yours Scott born thank you you have fine chair it's got memory

[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:06.440]   so we don't have to so that coverage will be starting on the 10th in a little more than a week
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:12.200]   we look forward to seeing you at twitlive.tv it's not gonna be offered as a podcast you just have
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:17.640]   to watch it live because it's it's like any delicious fish the next day you don't want it
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:21.640]   and Andy if you're gonna be in the Boston store that'd be really fun to hear from you out there too
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:26.760]   I will probably be well for the morning I might be able to be at the Boston store I'm going to be
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:31.720]   housebound for a little bit of that because I really don't I'm wondering if this is all the
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.040]   stuff that AT&T is wanting to tell us about there may not be anybody there yeah I'm I'm
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.000]   wondering what's what's awaiting us when we get there I think they're just gonna be slapping us
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.200]   with rotten fish just to say haha you put up with this because you want the phone you full you
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:49.720]   oh man yeah I mean this could be a big bust if if nobody wants the iPhone it might be it might be
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.960]   like the silliest thing we've ever done in which case we'll just pack it up and go home yeah but
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.920]   well you know I'm I think it's gonna be aligned with with the registration I think there's gonna be a
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:01.720]   line no matter what and we're gonna make the line of fun maybe I will go down to the Chicago
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:07.400]   apple store with my guitar and just start Jeff sink the people you're on deal deal dude okay great
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.480]   that'd be so cool I'll hack my phone I'll put quick on it real quick and I'll just stream it
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:16.040]   okay he doesn't have to be a quick you know there'll be somebody in line just tell them call to it live
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:21.560]   the Skype handle is call to it live just have them call to it live and or you know we'll figure out
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:25.560]   some way that they can get a hold of us ahead of time and say hey I've got video of Jeff singing
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:30.440]   the line will range out so we can see you because if anybody has a MacBook has a very good camera
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.760]   they can just aim it at you and we'll be able to see what's going on I think it's a lot of fun
