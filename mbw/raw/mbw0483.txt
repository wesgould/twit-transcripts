[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.520]   We're going to talk about Renee's 10,000 word review

[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.360]   the secrets of the Mac book.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.600]   And Andy will on camera fix his broken Apple pencil.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.680]   It's going to be a great show.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.600]   Next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.600]   And that casts you love from people you trust.

[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.640]   where we cover the latest news from Apple, of which there is none.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.040]   However, I've never stopped us before.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.120]   Look at this guy over here, Andy Inako.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.040]   He's ready for the holidays.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.120]   He's dressed nothing.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.520]   He's done nothing.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   Are you going to do a tree?
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.360]   Yeah, I got-- I have my bachelor tree in the window right now.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.840]   It's entirely--
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.160]   Andy?
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.680]   --tirely decorated with comic book and science fiction
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.200]   ornaments.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.000]   I saw your Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.880]   And I know you were happy, but it made me sad.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.400]   Why?
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.720]   It was-- it is no joke one of the best
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.880]   thanksgivings I've ever had.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.880]   You made turkey.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.560]   You made--
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.600]   Suvie turkey.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.320]   Suvie turkey, which you were very inordinately proud, which
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.640]   is good.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.200]   You had everything, cranberry sauce.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.480]   You had-- it looks like you had green beans.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   You had everything.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.000]   Green beans for the cranberry.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.960]   The front of mine makes this wonderful hot sauce
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.480]   with scotch bonnet peppers.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.960]   And so they were seasoned with this perfectly spicy sauce.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.480]   And then--
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.680]   Cranberry sauce from the can, the way that got intended.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.200]   Got intended.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   It's still got the ribs.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.480]   Got made cranberries round.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.240]   That's why--
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.740]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.240]   --cannery sauce.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.740]   I've shaped food.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.240]   There's nothing like it.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.760]   You even have gravy.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.240]   And then you're watching.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.360]   You're alone.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.480]   And you're watching the mystery science 3,000.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.840]   Marathon on your iPad all alone.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.000]   And it made me sad.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.480]   I wanted to invite you over.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.360]   Well, it wasn't--
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.680]   See, I started but did not finish a blog post about this,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.760]   that some people are--
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.920]   it's nice to have in the rotation
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.880]   a Thanksgiving alone for someone like me.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.360]   Because that's one Thanksgiving out of every three
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.880]   or four in which everything is the answer to the question,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.640]   well, Andy, what do you want on Thanksgiving?
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.160]   I'm serious.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.960]   It's like, do you want--
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   Do you want--
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.560]   Do you want--
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.480]   How do you want the beans--
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.000]   Just like--
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.560]   Do you want them?
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.060]   Great.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.000]   You have to do it this way.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.240]   How do you want the turkey sliced really thick
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.880]   and really thick?
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.760]   Great, really thick.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.480]   All that sort of stuff.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.360]   Do you want to eat it?
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.640]   Six or do you want to eat it one?
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.360]   Well, I actually wanted to eat it one.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.680]   But then I saw the turkey day marathon that, you know what?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.480]   Maybe I'll just eat it six instead.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   Everything-- there's no stress whatsoever, including, oh, my god.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.400]   I have to get there on time.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.760]   Oh, my god.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.240]   Did I bring the right kind of wine?
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.760]   It's--
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.560]   I did have--
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.040]   You're right.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.080]   I did have opportunities.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.880]   I had plans to have Thanksgiving
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.440]   with one of my sisters.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.360]   Unfortunately, those plans had to fall through.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.520]   Like the last two or three days.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.040]   And I certainly had friends who were pleased--
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.680]   would have been pleased to have me over.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.720]   But it's like, you know what?
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.280]   It's nice to start--
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.920]   it's nice to do Thanksgiving for yourself every three, four
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.120]   years.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.760]   Again, I don't have kids.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.200]   So that is an option for me.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.160]   So please don't feel sorry for me.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.840]   I was looking for a picture that--
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.880]   one of the first camera phone pictures I ever took, which
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.800]   was years and years ago at the CBS pharmacy,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.320]   this package of shelf stable Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.920]   It wasn't even in the refrigerated section.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.680]   It's had these two really sad slices of turkey,
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.000]   this petroleum-based gravy.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And that's what I captured.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.120]   I posted that on my blog.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.080]   I think I captured it.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.720]   It comes complete with dessert, a gun, and one bullet.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.280]   But this is not that sort of thing.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.640]   This is a celebration of--
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.720]   I'm going to enjoy Thanksgiving.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.960]   I was on social media sharing Thanksgiving.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.000]   But that's a family.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.840]   I shouldn't judge.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.360]   It was beautiful.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.800]   It was legitimately one of the best
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.000]   Thanksgiving's ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.320]   I am so happy for you.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.200]   Next time though, you come home.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.520]   Thank you for your concern.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.360]   Also, I've been talking to you, Andy.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.400]   I forgot to mention we also have Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.560]   He's here.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.880]   Wow.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.600]   That made me hungry.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.120]   It actually looks-- the sous vide really looks good.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.840]   And of course, the king of sous vide here, Mr. Alex Lindsay,
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.960]   a pixel cord.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.800]   He is in-- where are you?
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.040]   I'm in Tokyo.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.640]   Wow.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.440]   Are you in one of those capsule hotels?
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.680]   No, actually, not at all.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.880]   I actually caught a nice room.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   It just that it's very dark and light doesn't go that far back.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.560]   I want to stay in a capsule hotel.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.480]   Apparently, if you're in a capsule hotel,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.280]   you can whip out your iPhone and tell your pod to move
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.160]   to another location.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.200]   And it will automatically move.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.520]   Might have to try that.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.640]   Does it sprout legs like a studio jibbly cartoon?
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   I hope so.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.920]   I would spend money for it.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.080]   There's a photographer who posted a really nice medium
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.440]   essay on his visit to Tokyo in which he says that apparently,
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.480]   if you won't get moved, you won't get charged if you, say,
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.640]   move my capsule and then cancel it right before the move.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.240]   But you will get shaken a little bit.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.560]   And he said, it was kind of mean because, of course, we're
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.000]   in Tokyo and my girlfriend didn't know what I was doing.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And he said that was a terrible prank, but he enjoyed it.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.960]   Well, I have-- you know, the--
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.760]   of course, if you go to Tokyo, one of the places you always
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.480]   want to go is Akihabara, which is the electronic.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.280]   And now, I always have been going to Yodabashi, which
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.800]   is like the kind of the big--
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   you can buy consumer stuff and everything else.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.520]   And we would go there and think it's really cool.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.080]   And then we came around the corner.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.240]   I was looking for something else.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   And we came around the corner.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.480]   And there was like just a couple rock cables hanging
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.840]   on the outside of one of the buildings.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.960]   And we walked in.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.480]   And it was-- it's like the radio shack
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.280]   that you always wanted, except that it's the--
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.520]   I don't know, it's the size of old barns--
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.080]   like old borders, like two levels of raw--
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.480]   used to raw electronics.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.040]   You know, for-- and there's a lot of little old ladies
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.280]   coming in and buying electronics.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.000]   It's Tokyo, so very different.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.680]   I was like, what are they doing with those?
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.720]   This guy is-- his name is Damjan Zvetkov Dimitrov.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.240]   And it's a medium post on why he never
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.600]   wants to leave Tokyo again.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.720]   And this is one of the images.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.240]   This is-- see the big hand?
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.920]   That can come and take your capsule and move it.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.120]   But what's fun about these images is they're slightly
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.560]   animated.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.200]   They're like synographs.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.280]   And so things are happening like that.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.240]   His girlfriend is in the window, and she's moving her legs.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.680]   These photos are why I'm trapped in Tokyo forever now.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.040]   And I guess Nino Giamatreva is his girlfriend.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.000]   There she is.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.840]   This is the capsule hotel.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.000]   Look at that.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.240]   Now I want to go.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.520]   I know.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.440]   I can't do it.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.720]   I have to do it.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.120]   Here's where he's telling the story of how you can--
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.520]   you can ask to have a capsule moved,
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.760]   but then cancel at the very last minute.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.720]   But you'll get a little shake.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.640]   By the way, I'm sorry about that audio.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.760]   That's somebody calling me.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.920]   And of course, it rings every damn device I have.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   These are great, great images, so recommended.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.680]   But what are you doing in Tokyo?
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.760]   You know, Salesforce has a stream.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.840]   So we're here.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.320]   We're actually in the big--
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.760]   what they call it, the Brode of Con,
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.120]   whatever the big sumo thing we're setting up there.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.840]   Oh, that's the new sumo.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.840]   But it's a really cool, really cool location.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.920]   So that'll be on Thursday.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.960]   If any of you ever been to a big sumo match, I'd love to--
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.480]   I'm not.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.000]   I really--
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.360]   I'd love to go.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   Now that I've been there, I really want to go to one.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.240]   It looks like it'd be an incredible, incredible scene.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.200]   Someday, I'll get there.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.760]   And if I do, I'm staying.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.280]   Apparently, this capsule hotel is kind of old fashioned.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.240]   But it's quite famous.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.760]   It's the old fashioned capsule hotel.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.120]   I know.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.120]   It feels like I'm in Blade Runner, and yet--
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.040]   Well, my father used to go to Japan often, and he would--
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.240]   in the '80s, I think he would stay in those most of the times.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.600]   He must be around for a long time.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.120]   Yeah, I don't think they're--
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.160]   I think they're kind of now dated.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:23.000]   But I love this picture with the big giant motorized hand.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.240]   Back in my day, the capsules were real capsule pleo.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.800]   They were 16.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   Hello!
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.640]   Thanks.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.160]   Orphy, you were--
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.320]   I don't want to use them because you were drunk off your butt.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.760]   Right.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.600]   Right.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.880]   They were still $300 a night.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.960]   He calls it a capsule hotel.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.880]   Somebody's saying it's not.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.400]   It's not Kageen Tower.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.720]   It looks like The Matrix is what I--
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.040]   It looks like The Matrix.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.040]   It looks like--
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.560]   But--
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.400]   It was, by the way, it's--
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.000]   It was powered by the person in Tokyo.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.880]   The dollar is very strong here.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.040]   Oh, good.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.240]   Yeah, so it's a good time--
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.400]   if you're thinking about going to Tokyo?
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.600]   Oh, good.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.360]   It's a good time.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.400]   Nice.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.560]   Is it at three in the morning there?
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.120]   It's not three.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.480]   It's 4.30.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.520]   Geez Louise.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.840]   Thank you, Alex.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.560]   I'm sorry I had wasting your time.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.400]   I apologize.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.160]   We're good to work right now.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.800]   My call time isn't until eight.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.200]   I'm good.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   Oh, Alex, Alex.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.440]   Thank you for being here.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.520]   That's really nice of you.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.120]   Are you excited about Star Wars?
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.440]   We're only a couple of weeks off.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.520]   I know you all are.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.000]   Yeah, very excited.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.480]   We have 22 tickets.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.640]   22 seats to the first show in Petaloma.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.400]   We're going to all going to go.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.480]   You got me a ticket?
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.200]   You got me a ticket?
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.360]   I did, if you want to come.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.040]   I think-- I don't know if we're sold out,
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.360]   but I'm sure we can get you--
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.800]   I'm sure you have a--
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.560]   So the whole team has gone pretty much.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.960]   That's awesome.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.880]   But I got-- Greg signed up.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.000]   He said, I'm going to bring two people.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.480]   I said, Greg, you can't bring your whole family.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.840]   You got to--
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.720]   So I don't know.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.560]   We're going to have to-- we'll figure it out.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.840]   I'm bringing my whole family.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.560]   But they all work here.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.800]   Apples, I mentioned this because Apple has bought
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.240]   the maker of the motion capture technology
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.720]   used in Star Wars face shift.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.200]   That's a good--
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.440]   It's a good headline.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.440]   OK.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.800]   I'm a little insulting to the animators
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.400]   to say that face shift is--
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.000]   I'm sure that face shift was used on sun shots in Star Wars.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.560]   But we just have to remember that really good facial animation
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.760]   is produced by really good animators who sometimes may
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.960]   use either video reference or use some of the data
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.800]   from motion capture or facial capture as a starting point.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.680]   But I think it's really unfair for people
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.000]   to say that this is the software that did all the stuff
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.960]   that we saw in Star Wars.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.120]   It's just not the case.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.880]   No, I've actually used the software, and it's very good.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.600]   Is this similar to what they used on Andy's circus
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.840]   in the Planet of the Apes movies and in the Hobbit movies?
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.800]   It's a similar kind of float in front of his face.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.920]   And it captured his expressions so that when they animated
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.840]   the gorilla or the-- or garlem, he could look a human.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.560]   Right, and again, but there's--
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.000]   it's probably 30% or 40% of the actor,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.280]   and then the rest of it is animated by hand.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.120]   So it's a reference point, but it's not--
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.120]   Refinal.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.440]   There's a lot of tweaking that goes on.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.920]   And a lot of it takes the actual data and tweaks it.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.960]   So you're taking them--
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.760]   and I have done a lot of facial capture.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.640]   We have three motion capture systems.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.520]   I mean, we definitely do a lot of motion capture.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.280]   It's very useful.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.320]   And we don't do it at a level where
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.760]   we need to do anything more than the motion capture.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.080]   But when you're looking at Star Wars or a Pixar film
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.000]   or whatever, that stuff's being hand animated.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.080]   Now, WEDA, of course, does its own--
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.520]   has its own software that they use for that--
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.320]   for garlem or other things like that.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.640]   But this stuff is--
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.320]   face shift has been around for a while.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.000]   And it's actually very, very effective software,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.280]   especially if you're doing a little bit more
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.320]   faster turn stuff.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.520]   And again, as great, great reference.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.680]   I think that the thing that's really interesting here
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.200]   is why would Apple want to do this?
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.040]   And I think that one of the big problems
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.200]   with virtual reality just chats is
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.240]   that you can't see the person on the other side.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.800]   So I think that as soon as I saw this,
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.160]   to me what it looked like is, OK,
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.800]   if you're doing a virtual reality chat,
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.680]   you need to see an avatar on the other side,
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.600]   whether it's the real thing or whether somebody else,
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.320]   this will make it feel a lot more real.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.480]   So almost exactly two years ago that Apple bought PrimeSense,
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.400]   right out from under Microsoft, PrimeSense
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.160]   was the technology that's in the Microsoft Connect.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.120]   Yeah, the first connect.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.360]   And I'm wondering what Apple's interest is.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.440]   I mean, they got PrimeSense.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.120]   They got this company.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.880]   So do you think--
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   They buy a lot of other things.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.480]   They buy a lot of different things.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.040]   They buy a lot of different things.

[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.040]   I think that Apple could be, no, it could be that they just bought.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   There's something that they're thinking of doing five years in the future.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.040]   That's totally weird.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   That would just, when we think back five years later, we'll think,
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.040]   "Oh, that's why they bought this."
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.040]   I would never have guessed that they're using it for this.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.040]   It could be as simple as we have one day on an iPhone.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   That's almost entirely a piece of glass.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   It knows what you're looking at.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.040]   It makes the affordance for that button bigger than it would.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   Because right now, there's no dynamic affordance.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   A button size is a button size.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   Whether you're an expert, whether it's your first time using the device.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   Whether you have high dexterity, whether you have low dexterity.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   But in the future, affordance just means how easy it is to understand and use the control.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   That all stuff could be dynamic.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   You could flub hitting a button twice, and that button could internally get bigger for you.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.040]   Or it could tell that you're looking at part of the interface
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   and make that area easier to hit than part of the interface that knows you're not looking at.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   There's all sorts of really cool applications to this stuff.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.040]   Well, let's hope Apple implements them.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.040]   You know how Microsoft, of course, has, as does some Android phones.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   It doesn't work well in Android,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   but Microsoft has implemented face recognition in its surface line.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   They call it Microsoft.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   Hello.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.040]   And it's a pain in the butt.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.040]   Because it's kind of weird experience.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   So there's a little eye appears on the screen, and it goes looking for you.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   And when it recognizes you right away, it's great because the computer just opens up.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   But half the time it spends your looking at an eyeball going looking for you, looking for you.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.040]   And then it never finds you, and you have to enter in a pin code.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   And it's just kind of, and the new 950 phones apparently have iris recognition,
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.040]   which means, and this doesn't work well, I think from a user point of view,
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:23.040]   you have to hold the phone in a certain place, in a certain position for it to look into your eye,
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.040]   and you have to open your eyes up.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.040]   It's like global entry.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   Please back up.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.040]   Please back up.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   Well, you had to get into back to get into the US.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.040]   You get the retina right thing, and it says, get closer to the mirror, get further from the mirror.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   You don't want your phone doing that before you can use it.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.040]   There's just a pain in the butt.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   That's why I love fingerprint.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.040]   A well-implemented fingerprint is definitely the way to unlock a phone.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   I wouldn't mind seeing that on a Macintosh, of course, it's on the iPad as well on the iPhone.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.040]   Let's take a break.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.040]   When we come back, a really impressive Apple commercial that barely mentions Apple.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.040]   I saw it on TV the other day, and I realized about halfway through this is an Apple ad.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.040]   But I think most people would not have known.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   And then at the very end, just a little -- it's amazing.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   When you're a company that's this successful, we don't need to advertise.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.040]   We just need to spend lots of money on network television for fun.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   Our show today brought to you by Harry's.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:23.040]   Oh boy, the holidays are here, and Harry's has something for you on your -- anybody on your gift list.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   Whether it's your secret Santa gift, you don't want to spend a lot of money, but you want to get something nice.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:34.040]   Or it's like Dad or your husband, the loved one who's impossible to shop for.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   Harry's shaving sets, they started just $15.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.040]   And they're going to give you $5 off your first purchase.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.040]   So you -- I mean, that $10, and you can impress for --
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   Harry's was started by two guys who really are passionate about creating a better shaving experience
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.040]   by delivering an amazing shave at an affordable price right to your door.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:00.040]   They also give 1% of their sales and 1% of their time back to the communities they served.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   They're nice guys.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   I love my Harry's razors.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:10.040]   They bought the company in Germany so they could design these blades to be incredible at a fraction of the price of the big brands.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   That's probably one of the reasons why a million guys have shifted, have changed from those expensive department --
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   of a drugstore blades to Harry's.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   And I love it that they come, and I never have to worry about it.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.040]   And it encourages me to change my blade because I know I've got more blades.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   I don't have to hold onto that bright blade longer.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   They sent me this.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   This is their winter Winston shaving set.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.040]   This would be a nice gift, I think, for Dad.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   When you get it engraved, it comes in a beautiful box.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   Wrap that up and Dad's going to be so happy.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.040]   And inside this beautiful copper plated handle, the Winston, the engraving on it.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   And of course, as with all of Harry's shaving kits, you get three blades.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   You get the travel cover, which is really fantastically useful.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   And the Harry's either the foaming shave gel or the shave cream.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.040]   I'm a fan of the shave cream, but a lot of guys like the shave gel.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   Either way, they also have a travel bag you can get with the upgrade set.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   Or you can buy it separately.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.040]   And Harry's guarantees, of course, that you'll be satisfied.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   This is just beautiful.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   I really love what Harry's does.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   Harry's dot com, a great place to do some of your holiday shopping.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.040]   And they'll give you five dollars off your first order with the offer code MAC BREAK
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   when you check out.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.040]   Also free shipping for the holidays, but that ends December 10th.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.040]   So nine days.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.040]   So hurry.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:35.040]   H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com into the offer code MAC BREAK at checkout.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   Make every morning you shave feel like a holiday.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   With Harry's.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   I like that.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   Make your presence known.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   Isn't this pretty?
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.040]   It's so lovely.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   This stuff smells so great.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.040]   Oh, doesn't it?
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   Yeah, it's terrific.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.040]   They put they do coconut and marula and some really interesting extracts.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   That's why I use the...
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.040]   It also, I don't know why, but I just like a cream.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   It just, it makes me give me such a nice shave.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040]   Harry's.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.040]   H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   Here is the ad.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.040]   I think I saw it on football.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   I saw it on some high priced network show.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.040]   Maybe it was the voice Stevie Wonder and Andra Day.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   Oh, there's a Mac.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.040]   And VoiceOver, which is really nice to see.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.040]   Oh, because Stevie's blind, so he's using VoiceOver.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   Oh, see, that's so subtle in there.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   Exactly.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   Which I really like.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   And you get the product stuff out of the way immediately.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   And then it's really all about Stevie and Andra making music.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   I think this is almost a gift from Apple.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   I'd say so too.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.040]   But an interesting choice of tune too.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   I wonder if they were affected by how bad certain events were in 2015.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   Do you think so?
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   They were kind of...
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   Because if you listen to the lyrics, it really is about how I don't think the world's going to be in good shape for us,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   but maybe by the time our children are grown.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   Gosh, I love Stevie Wonder.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.040]   Oh, that's terrific.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.040]   That was amazing.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.040]   This must have cost millions of dollars.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.040]   Not just...
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.040]   And then there's the ad buy.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.040]   And like I said, they're buying this premium product.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   I'm sure it'll be on the Wiz on Thursday.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.040]   And there's an Apple product at the beginning.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.040]   And the thing is, you don't even realize it's an ad because...
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.040]   Oh, there's an Apple watch.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.040]   Everybody, every musician I know has a Mac.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   So it's like, no, it would have been there anyway.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.040]   The VoiceOver, I didn't pick up on that.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   There's an Apple watch.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.040]   Just someone happens to be wearing it.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   Somebody happens to be wearing it.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.040]   I so hope they release this track.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.040]   I just have my fingers for practically numbing,
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.040]   looking for buttons, looking for this download.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.040]   They haven't.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.040]   And then it just says, "Love Apple."
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.040]   Is that great?
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   Is that great?
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   You love a company that has so much money.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.040]   Give you a gift like that.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.040]   There was a great...
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.040]   I put it in the show notes.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.040]   There was a great Microsoft video.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040]   Oh, let's watch that.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.040]   As long as we're playing ads.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.040]   This is kind of funny.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   Yeah, it should really be under Microsoft.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   But it's kind of funny because it's...
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.040]   Well, let me play it for you.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.040]   Where is it?
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   Here it is.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   Microsoft sends 5th Avenue store employees over to the Apple store.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   Because they're right across the street, right?
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   The new Microsoft store.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   So there's the Microsoft store in 5th Avenue,
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   and people are in there.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.040]   I don't want to be mean, but do you think that they like to pack the store for the video?
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.040]   Yes, because it's not that full.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   It's not that full.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   And then the staff are going out and they're all wearing their green Microsoft beanies.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.040]   The notes say that they actually brought in employees from a whole bunch over,
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   and they also, of course, brought in a kids' book.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   And they're caroling outside.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.040]   And by the way, they have beautiful voices.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.040]   So I'm thinking they probably auditioned these employees outside the Apple store.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   And the Apple store employees were all wearing their red shirts,
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   which means they're going to be fired right after the holidays.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.040]   They're going to be shot by Klingons.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   They come out.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.040]   I think this is actually kind of sweet.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   This is not, this is not, I'm a Mac, I'm a PC by any means.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.040]   This is kind of almost a little like truce.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   ♪ Let me get with me ♪
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.040]   It's not your little Gates's commercial.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   It was both, it was, that was my mom's favorite church song.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.040]   And it says, "spread harmony."
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   I have to wonder, some did, did, did Apple have to sign off on that?
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.040]   You got to believe that they had to.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.040]   That's an interesting question, really?
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   I mean, they're, can all the employees?
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   It's interesting.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.040]   Well, even just the idea of, well, you're filming on the street.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.040]   Yes.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   But you have to get a permit from the city of New York,
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.040]   but I don't think you have to get a permit from Apple.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.040]   The employees came out.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   You don't see, you do see an Apple logo, right?
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   That's a registered trademark.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:59.040]   The logo is usually a big logo for a, for profit thing like an ad is usually.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.040]   And, you know, why wouldn't, why wouldn't Apple say yes to that?
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   It's sort of like, I was reading the back.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   How much?
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   How much is that?
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   How much is that?
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.040]   I was reading the behind the scenes story of that famous Letterman,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.040]   Jay Leno, CBS ad.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   And whereas there's a lot of like, when it was aired, a lot of people saying,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   "Wow, how, how did they get that happen?"
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   And there must have been a whole bunch of back alley deals and there,
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.040]   Leno must have like crossed NBC just to really stick the,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   stick the middle finger at NBC.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.040]   When the behind the scenes story was that, of course,
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   Leno asked, asked if that was okay with NBC and NBC said,
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   "You're saying that you want, you want, you want permission for you to appear
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   in a Super Bowl commercial that we do not have to pay for?"
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.040]   Yeah, why not?
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.040]   Use our jet.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.040]   Go.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.040]   I'd like to sing the word.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.040]   It's a, so according to an article in ad age,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.040]   they gave permission for use of their property in front of the store.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.040]   And somebody in the chat room and I think he's right said that the Apple
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:05.040]   employees would of course have to sign waivers and probably get boss
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   approval before they could go out there.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.040]   To leave the floor for like 20 of them?
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.040]   That's, they would have been a great, great, right?
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   The Jack Red says, "Who says their employees?
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   They could just be people in red T-shirts."
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   Well, I've been in the Apple store a lot lately.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   And a couple of weeks ago when in there, they were wearing gray,
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   which I remember the old blue shirts, which were great with the embroidered apple.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   In fact, somebody of an Apple employee, you know, illegally gave me one,
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   which I cherish.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.040]   But they were wearing gray, which I thought was so ugly, but now they're wearing
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.040]   red for the holidays.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.040]   It's much more festive, I like it.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   And I like that they changed the T-shirt color, just kind of on a whim.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.040]   The other thing I was surprised, I went in for Black Friday because I thought,
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   well, it's the day after Thanksgiving, nobody will be at the mall.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.040]   I'd be home with their family and loved ones.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.040]   But the Apple store was, you know, busy.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.040]   I asked the guy, "It's so funny because I go in the door."
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.040]   And we have an appointment at the Genius Park because we're getting a monitor fixed.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.040]   And there's a monitor, our monitor on the bar.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.040]   And then a little head comes up and some eyes look over it.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.040]   And I hear Leo.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   And then he goes, "You remember me, Fred?"
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   I said, "Oh, hi."
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   He said, "Oh, hi."
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   He said, "Oh, yeah, Fred.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   Hi."
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   Anyway, we got nice service.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   And while I was waiting, I was looking around and I saw three pencils on the shelf.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.040]   Three!
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   So I bought them up.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.040]   And then scout them on that side on the front.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   No, I bought two.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.040]   I left one for some lucky person.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.040]   So I finally got my pencil and canceled the order, which would not have appeared
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.040]   for two more weeks, December 14th.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   Weirdly enough.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   He said, "Yeah, I'm surprised to see those."
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.040]   Just sitting on the shelf.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   So I got my pencil.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.040]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.040]   And I, you know, I like it.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.040]   It is possible to make it lag if you have a lot of stuff going on.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.040]   But it's nice.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.040]   And I didn't realize this, but of course the pencil comes with an adapter that you can plug this
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   into a regular Apple charger, which is nice.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.040]   And it also comes with an extra nib.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   And they said the nibs were out.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040]   Why?
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   Friction.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.040]   Yeah, but it's, well, is there's not much you're on glass.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   I was using molecules.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.040]   Molecules at a time.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   Well, that's part of what makes pencil kind of interesting, that it, they didn't go for
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.040]   a hard, durable tip, which we have on a note taker.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.040]   They really wanted to make it feel like a felt tip.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:41.040]   They really wanted to make it feel like a natural, like a little friction in there.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.040]   It does feel good.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.040]   It's really fun to play with.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.040]   Unfortunately, I'm not an artist.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   So I get no value out of it at all.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.040]   Alex, did you get one yet?
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.040]   No, no, I ordered one.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   So I'm waiting for one.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.040]   And then I keep on going into every Apple store.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   Like, so it got me in stock and they're like, no.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   Oh, so I was just really lucky.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   They get them in like, they get a few at a time.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.040]   They got like a little shelf full of them.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.040]   They get a few more.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   They get to go like right when they open because I guess they're like,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.040]   this was just for in the afternoon.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   No, sometimes they get in in the afternoon.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.040]   Yeah, their deliveries aren't always first thing in the morning.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.040]   I thought, boy, Black Friday, I'm amazed to see those.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   Either they got a lot that morning or they got some more.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.040]   But I didn't know.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   Yeah, they also had the keyboard.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   Look at this is the, this is the Expando keyboard, you know, the Apple.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.040]   The smart keyboard.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   It ate all its vitamins.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.040]   No, Leo.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.040]   Let's take some more.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   Take some keyboard in first.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   Try again.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   It's not.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   It's smarter than its user.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   Definitely.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.040]   It is definitely requires some some Rubik's keyboard.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   It's about a gummy.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040]   Okay.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.040]   I have to adjust my, because I say, oh, get the logic to create because it has dedicated
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:54.040]   keys for iOS, you know, functions and it's got, it's over like a real keyboard, but it is also big and bulky.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   This is not so much.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   And there is key travel on this and you know what?
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.040]   It's fine.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   It's definitely, you know, you're typing on taffeta.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.040]   It doesn't feel, I feel like plastic.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.880]   But given, given the, you know, that I'm not probably going to use this to write the great
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:14.040]   American novel, the kind of amount of typing I do on the iPad, this is fine.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.040]   I didn't using it all week for hours.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   It's so much, it's so much lighter.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.560]   It's going to, it's going to, it's definitely going to be subjective.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.520]   There are a lot of people that are going to think that it's no, it's not the greatest keyboard
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.480]   in the world, but look how it's going to be always on my iPad.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   It's so thin and light.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.040]   I can't use that for more than 30 minutes.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.640]   It's just, well, I wouldn't like you.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   So you're a writer.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   I would certainly not want to be.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.040]   I use the MacBook and I use that and I'm fine with both.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   I'm just terribly sloppy yet.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:48.520]   This is, it seems like there's like, there's, well, we're running too much fabric here.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.920]   Some of us, Renee, some of us write a lot.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.480]   If you write a lot, but for what I use joking that, of course, that's completely.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.480]   How many thousands of words?
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   That's an obviously, yeah.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.480]   Renee, you're right.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.360]   I get it now because Renee just completed his iPad.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.360]   Sure thing.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:14.960]   Pro-
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.800]   When I first started typing on a MacBook or this keyboard and I haven't used it in a while,
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.960]   it feels incredibly odd to me, but after 30 minutes, I don't even realize I'm using it
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.960]   anymore.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:32.160]   Are all of the functions that you get on the Logitech Create keyboard are all of these
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.960]   functions available through some sort of keystroke on here?
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   No.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.040]   So, that's one of the things that you don't have a dedicated media row, for example, which
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.480]   you have on some keyboards.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.640]   But you do have things like Command Shift H will take you to the home screen, so you
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.920]   don't need the home screen key.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.960]   So it depends on what you need and there's no dedicated like function row key at all.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.960]   But some hand tab works.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   You could still do that.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   Command Space does lot light.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   Oh, that's good.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.120]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.400]   So I need to learn those, I guess.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.360]   Those are the two that I really keep the most about.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.320]   In Command Shift H is a big one.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   Command.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.320]   I really dig that a lot.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.120]   The fact that that's, I use spotlight and Command Tab on my MacBook so much as second
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.120]   nature.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.120]   So to see that translated just one to one to the iPad.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.120]   Right.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.560]   That's how I, you know, I, you know, I, you know, you're funny at it because for years
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:25.520]   you refuse to use Alfred or any of those launch, I was the same way because you didn't want
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.000]   that but because it wasn't beyond, you know, you had a very reasonable point, which is
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.480]   it's not going to be on every Mac I use.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.160]   It's a third party aftermarket thing.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.200]   So I'm not going to put it on there, but it's Command Space and it's the same kind of functionality.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.840]   Now that Apple's built in the spotlight, you can't live without it, right?
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.840]   I love it.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.640]   You could type the first few letters of anything application document.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   And I had the same sensitivity.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   I wouldn't do it until it was on everything.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.200]   Just because I just didn't want to, I, I end up on a lot of computers and I just didn't
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   want to have to.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   I just, I love that.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.520]   But I'm hoping as an iOS, another tip, another tip too.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:01.440]   If you've got it plugged into power, you can use H.L.O.M.O. to make sure you don't have
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   to take your hands off.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.880]   But why do you have to be plugged into power?
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.560]   Because you know, you don't own the other iPads.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.720]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.720]   It's got the A9X.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.280]   It theoretically does not need to be.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.440]   It's either that Apple is, it's, it's likely that Apple either just didn't enable it yet
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.640]   or believes it to something fundamental about the nature of the iPad that doesn't need
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.400]   to have the way that my phone does.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.720]   I hope the iPad will do that.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720]   No.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   Oh, just the iPhones.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.840]   Just the iPhone 6s and 6s plus.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.040]   But the A9X chip has the same integrated M9 processor.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.040]   So it should be able to do it.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.720]   I'm also hoping with iOS 10 that they, because there's some hints that they started putting
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.400]   keyboard navigation in there.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.600]   And I'd like to see, like there's no, there's no pointer in iOS.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.000]   So there's no mouse or trackpad support.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.360]   But just doing something like the focus engine where you move the arrows around to choose
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.400]   spotlight suggestions or to choose interface elements or to choose apps to launch, I think
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.040]   would just would make it that much faster to use with the keyboard.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.560]   I hope I really hope it's not an arbitrary decision.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.120]   There are times where I believe that Apple makes some decisions based solely on dogma
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.600]   and not on will it be confusing or will it be make things more complicated.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   And I hope that this is not a dogmatic decision because it's like Renee said, just the ability
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.920]   you can, you can, I can load up an application with spotlight.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.280]   But at some point I'm going to have to take my finger and reach out and tap it to launch
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.280]   it.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.280]   And just the ability to simply arrow key down and hit return to launch seems like such
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.280]   a simple thing.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   I don't know why they don't do it.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.920]   I think we've seen that we've done, we started with a tablet.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.920]   Now we're almost back to a computer.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.920]   We got our keyboard.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.920]   Okay, let's steal.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.920]   Let's steal.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.360]   Let's steal what's good for everything to make the perfect computer.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   That's what I think.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.760]   What, absolutely.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.320]   Somehow I got in a notepad I got commands.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   How did I do that, Renee?
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.360]   If you hold down the command key, you'll get the modifiers.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.960]   Oh, just holding down the command key.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   Okay.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   That's how you're listening.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.000]   So isn't it great that so much of what we're saying is so great about the iPad is the iPad
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.800]   Pro is just things that got around to giving us an iOS and iOS.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   It's just amazing.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.480]   So most of what we're what we're praising here is available to anybody who has an iPad
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.560]   Air 2 and even if they have the brand new iPad mini, I think it opens up so much better
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:13.040]   on the iPad Pro, but it's not as though they've really created a division between classes
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   of iPad owners.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.080]   It really is anybody who has hardware that can support these features.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.080]   Fine.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.080]   We'll give it to you.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   I do wish.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.840]   It's almost like it's thanks to the iPad Pro because for a very long time the iPad has
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.760]   lived in the shadow of the iPhone where devoting resources to the iPad would not add as much
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.600]   money as devoting resources to the iPhone.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.440]   So almost all the resources went to the iPhone and just got scaled up for the iPad and maybe
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.880]   a few minor adjustments.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.320]   And now that you have a flagship product, Tim Cook wants to carry with him, you have the
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.120]   resources made available to do things.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.720]   I lost my pencil already.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.680]   I tell you, this is this is what I ended up doing with my pencil.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.760]   I put it in on the keyboard like that.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.640]   Of course, that's a little bit in the way.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.560]   I wish I could find my pencil on the watch.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.560]   You just need to watch things.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.720]   Why am I just wish they had Apple had done some sort of affordance so that the pencil
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.600]   wouldn't just be floating free floating.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.000]   Not everybody buys a pencil, so they don't want a permanent attachment for an option.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.640]   But even a clip on the pencil, but it might be nice.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.480]   Aftermarket Homer head clip.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.520]   All I'm saying, Homer head should be Homer Homer head or troll head or whatever people
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.560]   want like a pess dispenser.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.360]   You could have a and the charging thing is so weird, but at least it doesn't take very
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.800]   long to charge it.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.440]   What is it command shift H there we go.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.680]   And if I go back to the settings here, this is kind of actually not in settings.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:32.200]   It's in notifications, you could see the battery of both the iPad and the pencil.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.000]   The first time you get the pencil.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   It's a year.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.240]   I know it's so weird.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:42.480]   The first time you get a pencil, you plug it in and the iPad will recognize it and say,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.840]   okay, you want to pair it.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.000]   It's very simple and it's very straightforward, very easy to do.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.720]   It's like the magic accessory pairings on the Mac.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.040]   It recognizes the lightning.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.120]   And it comes, at least mine did 99% full.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.560]   I mean, it was really ready to go.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.560]   The pencil was.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.200]   I do note though that it loses charge, loses juice pretty fast.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.360]   Like I don't think I'm going to get months out of this thing.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.280]   You get 12 hours of active use.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.280]   Well, and then it seems to be leaking, right?
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.800]   That like there's some loss without even using it.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   I don't know.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   I draw a lot.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   Yeah, that's what I say.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.760]   It hasn't been, it hasn't been unused by me long enough for me to.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:17.760]   Okay.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.960]   But I know it's like I'm, I charged it up yesterday to show it on iOS today and it's
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.960]   at 88%.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.280]   Now I haven't used it that much.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.440]   So I think there is some loss just from being paired, like maybe Bluetooth radio loss.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:34.640]   I will also say that I'm curious about durability now because I think I mentioned last week
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:40.040]   that I mailed it off to an artist friend who could actually use it the way that an artist
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.680]   attended to and work great for him.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.440]   But when it came back, it's no longer working.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.440]   Uh oh.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.080]   So I don't know whether it got damaged and transit, even though it was packed really, really
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.280]   well or whether just I'm not supposed to lick the tip.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.280]   I don't know.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.600]   Maybe the pencil's not working.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   Pencils not working doesn't charge.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.320]   It doesn't respond to do anything.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.760]   Even even when it's dead stick, unfortunately, it doesn't even work like as a dumb style as
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.600]   it's just can't even do touch things.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.280]   So I'm taking it to the Apple store tomorrow to see you.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.440]   They're going to, they're going to like undo the screws and like because it's so serve,
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   use the serviceable.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:17.040]   I'm so I'm sure they'll just like remove the fuse that blue or the tubes that need to be
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   fixed.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   That's interesting.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.040]   100 bucks.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.600]   I'm dying too because I love that pencil.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:28.080]   Well and I you probably mentioned this, but it's weighted in such a way that when it rolls,
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:33.760]   it always ends up with the tiny little logo, Apple pencil logo face up.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.840]   So there's a, well, that's not a good test, but there's a, there's a little weight in
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.840]   it so that it always ends up.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.840]   Right.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.160]   Which is, you know, thank you, Johnny.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:48.520]   I for your absolutely obsessive compulsive.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.800]   It's a pencil Leo and it's just, it's equally an impact.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   It's a pencil.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.320]   Johnny, you know what else would, would keep it from rolling off the desk?
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.320]   A clip.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.960]   A clip would be nice.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.240]   A clip would be good.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.080]   We don't, we don't all have to be obsessive compulsive.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.840]   We just need friends that are a certain number of friends that are, our designers need to
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   be.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.840]   It's inevitable Leo.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.840]   It is.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.600]   It is that way because it couldn't be any other way.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.480]   Can't take anything else away from it.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.480]   Stopping to work.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   I love designers.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.480]   All right.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.480]   Let's take a break.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   Come back with more.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.600]   Having fun talking, even though there's little to say.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.240]   I guess, I, you know what?
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.360]   We should ask Renee what he came up with in his IPEP Pro review.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   I mean, 10,000 words.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.560]   You must have some insight.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.360]   That said, I'm more.com.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   Renee Richie is here.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.200]   Alex Lindsey is here.
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.920]   There was a great article.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   I'll talk about when we come back.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.920]   Who was it?
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.920]   He was in the UK.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   Was it?
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.920]   You unspence.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:59.120]   I can't remember who reviewed the patents that are for the Macbook that give us some
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:05.640]   insight into, again, the obsessive nature of Johnny Ive.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.600]   It's really kind of, it was great reading.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.800]   I have to say, my favorite Mac now.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:16.880]   I love the 5K IMac, but that Macbook is just, I just love that thing.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.400]   It's not, it's really great.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.400]   And I'm less in love with the Mac Pro.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.520]   I wonder how that's selling.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.000]   I feel like that's probably with the 5K being so good and so powerful.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.560]   I feel like the Mac Pro, it's a very, very specialized audience.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   People like.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.560]   Assively parallel.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.560]   This one.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   Alex Lindsey is also here.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   Got a couple.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.560]   Do you have a few?
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.880]   I have a lot more IMacs than I have.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.920]   I have three, we have three Mac Pros and then we've got, I don't know, a slew of, mostly
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.320]   what we have in Macbook Pros.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.320]   I mean, you know, the, the retinas.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.320]   I mean, we have a lot of those.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.320]   Yes, you have to feel like that the Mac Pro, even for somebody like you, you don't need
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.440]   the power and the form factor makes it hard to pack because it's round.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.800]   Yeah, I've seen them.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.360]   So at events, we don't use them this way, but there are a lot of people.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.240]   There are, there are rack mounts that turn them sideways and put two of them next to each
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   other.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.480]   And you see these, we were at DreamWorks.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:13.000]   There were like six of them on top of each other, you know, just all, and you, you feel
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.600]   like you might get like sucked in like a jet engine if you want.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.400]   I have the forward torpedo.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.960]   Yes, you're back like the rocket here.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.880]   That's what I want.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.160]   The Mac Pro backpack.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.160]   I showed you.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.160]   Nio goes portable.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.720]   Look him in.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   You got it.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.040]   You know, you're going to have to have a big UPS to run it though.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.200]   So you have like 60 pounds of UPS and then battery on it.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   Yes.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   I showed it.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.760]   They brought to you by ITProTV.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.680]   If you're an IT professional or you want to be one, you need to know about ITProTV.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.640]   Originally created by those great guys, Tim and Don, we've seen them here many times.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.720]   And I'm, you know, they're fans.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:58.080]   I'm a fan to help people get their certs so they could become ITPros and get a job.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:06.000]   Serts like A plus Cisco CompTIA security plus the CCNA MCSA certs.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.800]   But I think it's also a great way if you're an IT professional too.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   There they are.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   There's Tim and Don.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.640]   Tim, to tune up your knowledge, to stay on top of things.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:19.440]   And even for people like us who aren't professionals working in the field, man, there's so much
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.440]   good stuff there.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.840]   ITPro.tv/Macbreak.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:29.400]   It's the video network dedicated to the world of information technology.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:33.320]   Over 1000 hours of content now and that number is going up all the time.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   They do.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.120]   They have two studios, 50 hours of content added every week.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.120]   They stream it live and on demand, just like we do.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:45.920]   You can watch it on your Chromecast, your Roku, your computer, your mobile device.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.800]   New courses on Mac integration, Mac management, OS 10 server support, OS 10 server essentials
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.160]   so it's not just Windows and Cisco.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:59.760]   For project managers, there are courses on six Sigma and ITIL have also updated their
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.640]   project management professional course to reflect changes to the exam that are coming
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.320]   up in January.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.240]   You pay one low monthly subscription price.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.920]   No hassle cancellation policy because I think people think, "Well, as soon as I get the
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.840]   Seridol cancel, I bet you won't though."
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.280]   You'll see why when you start watching.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.200]   You also get some great things like they're over 100 step by step virtual machine labs
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.040]   that only require an HTML5 browser.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.360]   You also get the Transcender practice exams.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.920]   That's worth 109 bucks.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.120]   So even if you're already studying with a book or you go into a technical school, there's
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   their set.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:40.920]   If you want to learn PowerShell, actually I'm working on PowerShell.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.920]   I'm really interested.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.520]   They have a great PowerShell course.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:50.000]   Courses on certified ethical hacking, crypto, corporate and group pricing is also available.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:00.120]   They have, I mean, universities loan Harvard, MIT, UCSD Stanford, all are ITPro.tv users.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.800]   Check out ITPro.tv/Macbreak.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.600]   Raise your brain with the most popular IT certs recognized by employers.
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.840]   Now subscriptions, let's talk price.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:16.440]   Normally 57 bucks a month, you can buy a year, get two months free or try this.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.760]   Go to ITPro.tv/Macbreak.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.280]   Use the offer code Macbreak 30.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.200]   You'll get a free seven day trial.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   That's their second studio.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.200]   That's their new studio.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.680]   I haven't seen that before.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:34.160]   You get a free seven day trial and you can watch the live stream and you'll get 30% off
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.000]   your subscription for the lifetime of your account.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.600]   Now we're talking 40 bucks a month with two months free when you buy an entire year.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.040]   Get the year too because then you could download all the content and watch it offline, things
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.440]   like that.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.440]   Just great.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:51.680]   They have the chat room just like we do, which means, and they do special Q&A and study
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.680]   sessions.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.040]   It really is geared around getting your certs and it's great.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.800]   ITPro.tv/Macbreak.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:05.280]   Try it for free for seven days and get 30% off when you use the offer code Macbreak30.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.000]   We love you guys.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.720]   Tim and Don, they've done such a good job.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:16.040]   And we thank them for being such big supporters of our show.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.240]   Apple Pay in China, first Canada and now China.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.240]   What's next?
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.840]   We discovered second cup takes Apple Pay, Renee.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.040]   I did, but then I went to another outlet and they didn't.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.880]   So apparently Barry's by franchisee.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.520]   So I'm just not going to win this Leo.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.400]   I saw that American Express card on the watch.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   Boom.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.240]   I once called up a place and I placed an order and they say we don't have it.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.160]   And I said, but I saw your commercial and they said, you know, in the commercial where
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.600]   it says it participating outlets.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.840]   And I said, well, we're not participating.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.640]   We're not.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:51.000]   And then tech, we always look for an Antex technical breakdowns and they did one on the
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.040]   AX9 system on a chip.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.200]   12 GPU cores.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.920]   No, when we talk about Johnny, I think sometimes we don't give enough credit to Johnny Saruji,
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.040]   who's the other big Johnny at Apple.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.400]   He's in charge of the platform technologies like the chipsets and everything in there.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.760]   Their work has been incredible for the last few years.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.640]   I think they're the most exciting chip design and company in the world now.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.240]   And if you told me that Apple would be the one we talked about that way five or 10 years
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.040]   ago, I would have thought that you would have lost your mind.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   And now they're routinely doing incredible, incredible Silicon.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.000]   So last month, an on tech did, you know, like what they could do with software, but
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.520]   they got chip works actually take down the dip and look at what's in there.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:38.000]   And so now they have a little bit more of physically information about the system on
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.440]   a chip, which they say lets us confirm and reject some of our earlier theories.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.960]   Look at all those GPUs.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.960]   That is crazy.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.120]   And it's custom too.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.280]   It's not a known imagination reference design.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.080]   Which is pretty much required to run a large display and what they're trying to do.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.520]   So this is really for the pro.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.840]   I think put all this stuff in here.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.240]   Wow.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:11.080]   They talk about the die size, 147 square millimeters.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.960]   Pretty big, but it's got a big tablet is better.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:18.400]   Well it's yeah, but it's got, I mean it's got a, it's it's both shrunk and it's still
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.440]   big because it's got everything on it.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:25.440]   I mean, this is the whole system on a single chip.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.280]   Pretty impressive.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:37.160]   So if you're interested, if you like the gritty details, weirdly enough, there's no L3 cache.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:41.240]   Which means that memory latency can kind of go up.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.760]   It seems like they must be doing something.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.160]   I mean, they wouldn't have just gotten rid of it.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:50.680]   It seems like there must be a reason that they were able to work around that problem.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.040]   Like one generation, I forget which one, but they went really wide and they did that instead
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:00.800]   of, I mean, I'm not as familiar with an antica-hole terminology, but they do very, mobile is all
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.560]   about compromises, whether it's cameras or chipsets or anything.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.320]   And Apple routinely makes really, really smart compromises on these things.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.120]   And every, you could take one part and say, well, this part could be better, but then
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.760]   it would make something else worse.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.440]   And they've been very good at finding a good balance.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:17.000]   And when you look at the performance on this thing, I thought that maybe I had pro attacks
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.240]   these chips because I couldn't get anything else to and it just, I can't find a way to
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   peg these chips.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.040]   It's really swift.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:30.440]   And non-theory is that because they have such a fast memory bus, a 51.2 gigabyte per
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:35.200]   second memory bus that the cache isn't really necessary.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   You usually use the cache to kind of compensate for a slower bus to keep the GPU fed.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.680]   It's one of these weird things.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:46.280]   Like I was asking about the 10-100-based T on the Apple TV and not having gigabit.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.800]   And Alex might know this better than I do.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.720]   But one of the answers I got back was when you go to gigabit, it pegs the CPU on very
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.520]   high, on very high bit rate video.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.200]   And that makes it unpredictable.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.520]   So they start dropping frames.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.360]   So for the Apple TV, 10-100 is a better compromise than gigabit.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.760]   And there's all these little things you have to contend with.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:11.560]   Somebody told me that because it's 10-100, you should use the Wi-Fi on the Apple TV.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:15.440]   The Wi-Fi is not, they use the better Wi-Fi not because it's faster, but because it's
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.440]   more reliable.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.840]   And with Wi-Fi reliability is incredibly important because there's so many more things
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.320]   that can interrupt the interrupt thing.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.080]   Yeah, we tell people not to use Wi-Fi on our Skype connections because there'll be
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.680]   hesitations because it periodically just stops.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.360]   Well, a lot of times what's going on with Wi-Fi is that your Wi-Fi router, especially
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:38.240]   if you're in an urban area or in an office or things like that, your Wi-Fi, the router
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.840]   is very, or the access point is very chatty.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.160]   It's like, "Hello, hello, hello."
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.280]   Like it's saying hi to everybody walking by.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   Everybody get it.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.240]   So if the number of devices and everything else don't change very much related to the
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.640]   AP, it's actually very stable.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.000]   It's that it's dropping.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.080]   When it drops packets and you're just surfing the web, it doesn't matter.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.240]   When you're having synchronous video, it matters a lot.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:05.080]   So that's why Wi-Fi does work really well in the country.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.840]   You know, as far as you can have someone do Wi-Fi and that type of thing, but in a place
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.440]   like where I'm at where there's 50 access points within my recovery.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.400]   I have a hard wired connection.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:22.240]   At least I can connect it to a gigabit port, which means I'd be getting 100 megabits.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.320]   Because I want the better performance.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   It was buffering.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.720]   Well, I thought it'd be the hardware would be more stable, but a number of people said,
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.120]   "No, no, you should use Wi-Fi on the Apple TV."
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.640]   What do you think?
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.920]   It's one of those things where there was a ton of people complaining that Apple didn't
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.400]   put gigabit and why aren't they doing this?
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   And if you go by the assumption that the engineers building stuff aren't stupid and
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.280]   that they might have reasons for doing stuff, then you start to invest in that.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.280]   That's how I found this.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   I just started investigating what are the pros and cons.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.840]   100 is fast enough for high-def video.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:51.720]   For 1080p video, for 60 frames per second, 1080p is more than fast enough.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.320]   And it's also still more reliable than wireless.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.680]   The new wireless is much better than the old wireless because 8L11AC has a bunch of other
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   capacitors.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.160]   If I have ethernet capability, which I do, you say use it.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.160]   Yes.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.160]   Yes.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.160]   Unless you have a really fast connection, you're 100 megabit.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.160]   Does it matter?
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.800]   I mean, I have Comcast business.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.400]   I think it's 100 megabit.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.200]   But that's the max speed of the internet connection.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.200]   Exactly.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.640]   I'm matching that.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.440]   Well, maybe not because of the overhead.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.240]   And a max of it is going to be about 96.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.880]   But let's say it's usually I divide it in half.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.440]   So let's say I'm getting 15 megabits.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.880]   Well, there's no stream I know of that needs more than 15 or 20 or 25.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.800]   I mean, 50 is more than enough overhead.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.360]   So hardwired should be fine.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   Yes.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.320]   That's also going to be always more reliable than Wi-Fi.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.400]   That's what I would think.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.760]   You plug it in and it works for us with Wi-Fi.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.760]   I never have to recredential myself for wired.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:56.520]   I never have to worry about interference with wired.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.720]   If you can run a wire into every single room in the house, run a wire into every single
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   room in the house.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   Just make it more reliable.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.720]   Okay.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.720]   I'll ignore those people who said, "Oh, leave."
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   That's right.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.720]   And get lots of leverage.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.720]   Yeah, get lots of leverage.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:15.480]   Oh, it's the same thing going back to the debate about Samsung versus TCMA chips.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.440]   We look at one very narrow dimension and we think that applies broadly to everything,
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.440]   but that's not true.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:23.040]   There are different characteristics, all these technologies, and you've got to know which
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.680]   one is the appropriate one for what you're trying to do.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.600]   And yes, I think in general, trust the Apple engineers.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:38.960]   That said, it would make you feel a little bit more secure if you knew that if there
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:45.120]   were an app, if they do that, if the Apple TV were to support 4K at some time in the future,
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:49.920]   at least I know that I've got more bandwidth than I actually need for what Apple TV could
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   do right now.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.880]   So anyone's not hardware-gradable to 4K, so we have to give you a box anyway.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.880]   Right, yeah.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.880]   Which is fine because...
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.840]   HDMI 2.x, we want a bunch of stuff we'd want on it.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.720]   Yeah, I'm not buying a 4K TV yet, so that's fine.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.320]   A lot of people did though.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.280]   There was a 4K backdrop, yeah.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:10.800]   There was a 4K backdrop on the Black Friday deals.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:15.440]   There's some people who opted for the $250.55 inch Westinghouse TV at Target.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.440]   $250.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.600]   Wow.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.400]   And then there's some people who took advantage of Samsung's Black Friday deals, were half
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.600]   off their SUHD 4K TVs.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.520]   Alex, you have a 4K TV.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.520]   Of course, you have a 4K TV.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.760]   But what do you feed it with?
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.960]   Well, you know, I've watched a little bit of my own footage on it.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.600]   You know, I've got a lot of 4K.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.600]   I have a red camera.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.400]   Why else would I get it?
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:43.800]   Well, I mean, even the GoPro, you know, looks a lot, you know, is shooting in 4K and a lot
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.440]   of the Black Magic cameras are shooting in 4K.
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:48.560]   So that's been useful.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.520]   There's also some of the Amazon stuff is all on in 4K.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:56.160]   Which the problem is, is that the Amazon stuff is a good example of what doesn't work,
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   which is that on some of the stuff it looks great because there's not a lot moving, but
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.280]   then you just see compression artifacts as soon as you, because the Amazon's built into
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.200]   the TV or whatever.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.720]   So it's not been a killer experience there, but I wasn't going to buy a TV over 60 inches
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.720]   that didn't, wasn't 4K because eventually, you know, you're going to invest in the TV.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:22.960]   I feel like, you know, I can see the on a TV over 60 inches.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.520]   I can definitely see the edges on 1080p.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.520]   So you know, so I can, you know, I can see the, you know, it bothers me.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.520]   Only you.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.000]   It bothers me.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.480]   It is like, I'd rather have it, you know, because a lot of these 4K, they're interpolating
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   up a little bit.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.320]   So it actually softens it up and makes it actually look a little bit sharper.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:45.920]   I mean, I find that it's more pleasing for me to watch a great up-res 1080p to 4K.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.600]   Now, where's, you know, then, you know, if it's doing a good job, if it's doing a good
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:50.880]   job, I think it's easy to do.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.480]   What does the best 4K up-res?
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.160]   You know, I haven't had the opportunity to really test them.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:00.640]   I can say that the Vizio that I got, I didn't go crazy with buying really expensive TV either.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   No, I know.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.640]   Good job.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   Oh, yeah, it does a great job.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.600]   So I think that the, it's a good TV.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.800]   I've had a lot of Vizio's just because I just, you know, I want a big TV, but I don't want
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.960]   to spend, you know, live brand on a thing, you know, so usually my limit is usually about
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.960]   $1,500, $1,600.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   So if I can, there was some sale.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   So wait on HDR?
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   I want the HDR.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.280]   Yeah, I'm waiting to.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.280]   That's exactly right.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:28.360]   So there is a standard we think there's two right now coming for a UHD and one, and what
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:35.360]   we're looking for is the standardized color space and a standardized image.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.360]   I want a 4K HDR 120 frames a second.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.360]   I think that's pretty much.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   And so that's not here.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.880]   You got a 24 frames.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   That's not here.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:43.880]   24 frames.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.640]   You know, that whole 24 frames, you know, you know, why is 24 frames?
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   Because it looks bad.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.480]   No, but looking bad looks so good.
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.920]   It was 24 frames because that was the least number of frames.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:51.920]   I know, right.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.680]   The cheap skates in the 20s could get away with.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.680]   Safe builds.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.360]   So we've built this entire platform around the back.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.360]   I used to it.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.160]   It was like, how do we save money?
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.960]   Like 100 years ago.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:02.960]   Anyway, we used to.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:06.120]   We used to make complaints that the Apple TV doesn't support 24 frames per second.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:11.560]   You know, Alex, I've got people trying to convince me to go out and get a film camera
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.440]   because in a, it were, yes, it's grainy and it's contrary.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.440]   You know, it's weird.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:20.240]   It's not as accurate as digital, but there's a look.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.760]   Same thing with 24 frame.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.280]   Well, you tell me sometimes to shoot 24 frames.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.880]   There's a filmic look, right?
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.880]   It's why I have two boats to Europe.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:31.800]   I think I said, the last time I shot 24 frames, it was to do the same thing that the filmmakers
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.880]   were doing, which was to save 15% on my bandwidth.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.880]   Oh, that's not the case.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.880]   In the early days.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.640]   When we did the early Mac breaks, you know, when bandwidth was a big issue and we kept
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:47.080]   on putting people, you know, seizing networks and stuff like that, we 24 frames literally
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:50.360]   cut the bandwidth usage by 15, the file size by 15%.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.360]   And that was a big deal.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.280]   And after that, I, you know, we work at anywhere from 30 to 60.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   Interesting.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   And you're not one of those.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.680]   It's fetishizes 24 frames.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.960]   No, if you do live, it's really hard because all of your live equipment is not designed
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.120]   for 23, 9, 8.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.600]   And so you very quickly that it's beaten out of you pretty quickly.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.840]   And we always see people who start doing live streaming and they all want to do 23, 9, 8.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.600]   And then, you know, you talked to them a year later and they're at, you know, whatever
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:21.080]   59, 9, 4, you know, whatever they've given up because it's just not, it's just not practical
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.600]   because it's just, there's so many pieces of equipment that just won't, won't do that.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.680]   7.1 has started showing up in the app store.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.840]   So I'm super happy.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.180]   There's no way to find it unless you land upon a by accident, but you can get Dolby
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:35.560]   7.1 stuff there now in the app store, the app store, sorry, in the iTunes store.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:39.080]   So like I, we rented Rocky Horror Picture Show and it's just a try it out.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.080]   Sounds great.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.640]   So you have a 7.1 system?
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   Yes, obviously.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.440]   That's what's a stupid question.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.480]   Yeah, I have both my systems are 5.1.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.960]   I find that's fine.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.760]   But it's a numberly also you have to try it.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:56.520]   And I really, and I'm really, I'm really not sold on that most about the idea of having
[00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.840]   a speaker above me coming from the ceiling.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.120]   I don't care if Batman's coming down from the ceiling.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.320]   I'll imagine it crashing through the ceiling.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.120]   This Black Friday was kind of, I think a watershed Black Friday for the first time ever
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:16.080]   by the slightest margin more people chopped online than they didn't brick and mortar
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.080]   stores.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.600]   And a lot of that was on iOS.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.920]   78% of mobile shopping on iOS devices.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:32.000]   This is from Kostora e-commerce pulse.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.280]   21% Android devices.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.600]   And given that really there probably as many if not more Android devices out there than
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:45.880]   there are iPhone devices in the US, that's pretty, I guess iPhone people are more likely
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.600]   to shop online.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.600]   I guess.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.960]   Well, iPhone people, this trend has been, I think it's almost since the iPhone was released
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:56.120]   is that iPhone users tend to spend more money.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.440]   Just in general.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440]   And so, yeah, there's kind of a general thing.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.960]   They buy more apps, they buy more things, they buy more accessories.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.040]   Yeah, but this is the Black Friday thing, right?
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.040]   Isn't it?
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.040]   Or maybe not?
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.360]   Well, a lot of the stuff is skewed because remember that Android devices are very wide
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.160]   gamut of devices, a lot of the blister pack like Go phones are Android devices and they're
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.160]   not necessarily even capable of doing it.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.120]   A, they're not necessarily capable of doing everything that iPhone can do and B, the people
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.280]   who buy them don't necessarily buy them the way that someone would buy like a Samsung
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.520]   Galaxy S6, they buy it as they're just day to day.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.040]   All I need is a phone for text messaging and Facebook.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.640]   So it's hard to, it's easy to read a lot of stuff in a data like that.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:45.720]   But it does make sure that we have to understand that if people are trying to think that iOS
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:51.920]   is waning because the dominant operating system in the world is Android data like this, it
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.280]   says, no, no, no, it's not waning.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.480]   Let me just see if I can find that article.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.040]   Maybe I can't.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.400]   Yeah, here it is.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:10.040]   It's from Forbes, you and spend secrets of the MacBook.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:16.000]   And the idea is I guess you and went through the patent applications that are specific to
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.240]   the MacBook to come up with some of the interesting things.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:27.240]   I think the MacBook, not the MacBook Pro, just the thin 12-inch one is a pretty amazing
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.600]   device.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.280]   The low profile of the MacBook he writes is in part down to putting every component on
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:36.400]   the diet to reduce thickness.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.680]   And so force touch is, which is on it.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.400]   They do have, it's interesting, force sensors.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:48.520]   The patent says we could get by with fewer.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:53.400]   The color, rather than being painted on, the color is added as an ink layer during the
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.800]   chemical process that strengthens and hardens the case, creating a far more durable look.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.160]   You can't scratch the gold off, in other words.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.880]   They say by the way, gold is a vital color in the Chinese market.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.960]   The hinge is really easy to analyze.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.960]   Yeah, I love the gold stuff.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.920]   Even my iPad, everything I'm just buying gold now, it's all I buy.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.800]   Even rose gold, I like.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.920]   Because I can has opulence.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.720]   This is the one I love.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.480]   The speaker grill on your MacBook.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.680]   The MacBook drilled holes for the speaker grills all look exactly the same, but that's
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.480]   not actually the case, some of them are over the audio channels.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:36.000]   The pipe, the sound out from the speaker, others are over circuitry and some are simply
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.600]   dummy holes for a better aesthetic look.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.800]   And Apple has used different colors of ink inside each hole as well as varying the depth
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:49.480]   of the dumb holes to create a uniform appearance across the full strip.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.520]   OCD much.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.040]   But I guess that's why we love it, right?
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.080]   Yeah, I mean, bring the industry forward.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.200]   Well, it's a standard.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.400]   It's hard for anybody else to live up to.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.400]   For as much.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.400]   Go ahead.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.800]   It's just such a special device.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:14.240]   And it certainly wasn't for the majority of MacBook consumers, but you look at how it
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.240]   works and you look at everything inside it and you appreciate that this is Apple very
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.040]   intentionally making computer that is going to be great for them in two years time.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.200]   And their attitude was, well, why wait, let's just make it right now.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.400]   Let's show off a little bit and say that this is we are willing to.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.680]   We're willing to take all those pies in the face where people saying only one USB port
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.920]   and it's also the charging port.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.120]   I have not had I actually love that.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.960]   And it's one of the reasons it's so thin.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.800]   The available ports of the MacBook caused a lot of discussion when first announced with
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.280]   almost everything reduced to the solitary USB-C port.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.400]   Not only now this is interesting.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:55.320]   And not only does this reduce the complexity of construction, but the port itself, its construction
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:01.440]   could be a little more than a tongue on the printed circuit board with the case providing
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.280]   the protection and the support.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.840]   And then they merely have to.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:10.800]   There's one less component on the PCB and the ability to keep everything thin thanks
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.800]   to the lack of a metallic housing on the PCB.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:18.840]   All they do is put a gasket around it so the dust can't get in through the.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:22.360]   Even the force touch keep trackpad because it's not a mechanical trackpad.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.160]   You don't have to actually have anything underneath it.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.320]   You don't have to stack it vertically.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.400]   You can have the logic for that wherever there's room for it.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.400]   And the terrace battery is brilliant too because a lot of people I think they think that battery
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.040]   is like frosting and that if Apple would just put a frosting thing in and pump more
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.440]   batteries and everything it would all be magically better.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.080]   But battery geometry is hard and it's a thermal insulator.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.120]   It's not radio transparent.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.800]   There's laws governing the size of battery cells and size of batteries that you can ship
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.800]   safely.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.040]   There's all sorts of concerns for batteries.
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:53.440]   When you look at the Mac Pro, Apple very deliberately showed the terracing they had to
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.720]   go through to make as much battery in there as they can.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.600]   It's not just carve a bigger battery.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:03.120]   It's all this effort to terrace the layers of the cells and it's pretty remarkable.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:11.520]   German media conglomerate actual spang is suing iOS and iOS ad blocker.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.880]   Now we had we did a great triangulation yesterday with two of the guys from adblock plus in
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:22.760]   Germany and the guy who does crystal for iOS and it turns out this is yeah he's great.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:28.560]   Dean is Dean Murphy's great really neat guy and you know what's funny is crystal he just
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.280]   was kind of an offhand thing he heard about it.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.200]   He said well let me see what I could do.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.280]   He didn't really think about it as a product and now it's become a full time job of course
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.280]   he's sold.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:43.240]   He says when it was free in the first few days he there were 100,000 downloads.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.240]   Now he's kicking himself.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.560]   He should have charged 99 cents.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.200]   He does now.
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.240]   But in any event Springer has it's not the first time they've filed suit against ad blockers.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:58.680]   This is against Biola the blocker B.O.O.C.K.R. one of the best selling ad blockers on iOS
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:02.680]   9 but they sued adblock plus and this is important.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:09.680]   Lost in every court case so far in Germany against adblock plus adblock plus is prevailed
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:16.160]   because the German courts don't say anything illegal with blocking ads.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:22.280]   So you can understand why publishers are upset about ad blocking and they continue to sue
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.600]   but it seems unlikely that they will prevail in those.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.880]   They certainly have it to now and there have been many many cases including actual Springer
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.520]   against adblock plus.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:37.600]   Good by the way I think I thought a very interesting topic and a good conversation from
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.680]   yesterday's triangulation if you're interested in the issues of adblock because of course
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.560]   I have mixed feelings as I know you do Renee.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.160]   It's funny though I forget who said it it might have been Mac stories but the ad blockers
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.560]   have tumbled from the top charts.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.640]   They're super popular at launch and there's just it doesn't say like everyone thought
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.760]   everyone was going to adopt them because they were easy to do and it turns out the rates
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.760]   haven't really changed.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:03.520]   I think it's not I think it's not been the adblock ellipse many feared.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.360]   There is a rumor again as there was last year that Apple will abandon the headphone
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:16.960]   jack on the iPhone 7 in favor of lightning port connected headphones.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:21.840]   Last year the same rumor didn't materialize do you think it's more credible this year?
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:27.240]   It's every year I mean every year they prototype multiple iPhones they have very progressive
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.160]   ones and very conservative ones and they make their decisions along the product curve when
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.400]   they need like there's a certain point where they have to start manufacturing was they
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.440]   have to decide but up until then Apple is going to experiment with anything that any
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.480]   of us in the internet think that they should have their smart logical company and they
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:45.440]   have billions and billions of dollars so they have an iPhone 7 with 3.5 millimeter headset
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.600]   jack and they have one probably with USB C and one with lightning that they have adapters
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.440]   for I think HTC had an adapter for one years ago one one of their phones so it's it's it
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.880]   would be it would be surprising if this were not the case and then you know the the bottom
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.600]   line is is that the headphone jack while been around while it's been around for a long
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.360]   time is you know old technology there's only so much you can do with it so you know having
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:12.160]   a legacy connector makes sense to some degree but I think that we're probably one or two
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.920]   versions away before they get rid of it just because it's a again it's legacy it's there's
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:19.240]   only there's a limited number of things once you move away from that and there's a lot
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:22.360]   of things that'll be problematic for me because I just have a lot of things that'll plug into
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:27.280]   it but of course there'll be adapters and all kinds of other things to to get us along
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.520]   through the hump but I think that there'll be a lot of other things whether it's quality
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.880]   of audio or the types of things you can do with that interface that will be increased
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:40.280]   when as it's as it moves away from the old fashioned analog solution.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.800]   This is this is in the category of I'll believe it when they're actually shipping it because
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:50.400]   that would be a really big big leap the thing is I mean that the technology for headphones
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:55.680]   is actually predates the 20th century it's so old but the thing that was seriously I think
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:01.360]   the first the first like plug-in headset was like 1890 something wow but the thing is the
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:07.160]   damn thing works and it's works for a really broad group of people ranging from the people
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:11.040]   who are serious audiophiles who will spend three hundred dollars on a pair of headphones
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:17.320]   to the average user who just will use the same set that came with the the handset forever
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:23.520]   until it breaks and they'll buy another set for 10 or 15 bucks I don't I it's not I will
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:28.080]   never predict that Apple won't do something particularly it's double dumb to predict that
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:33.400]   Apple won't do something that will make a device look more attractive or once again
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.560]   pursue some form of dogma that they just simply believe is important for device design
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:45.960]   but that would be such a huge step the and would also I will prepare about 40 metric
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:51.320]   tons of jokes to make if Apple were to say sure you can use any headphones just carry
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:57.400]   this dongle with you for the phone it's like I joke to I joke to a year ago or a couple
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.440]   years ago with the Macbook Pro that they're basically they're like Gillette and that they
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.360]   give away the computers they make the money on the dongles because they are the dongle
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:10.920]   company and if they were to say if they were to say you can't plug headphones in unless
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:17.160]   it's proprietary stuff that makes a licensing fee for Apple or you use it through a dongle
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:22.520]   that's so wow that's a that's a that's a sandwich for some stale bread that you're
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:26.040]   going to know your way through to make that just the headsets either is things like square
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.320]   readers and scientific measuring tools that use that's I mean it is it is a port not
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:35.880]   just a headset jack and the tandy's point is it is going to be a huge a huge transition
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.520]   fee to that but Apple's a company that has decided sometimes in the past that those fees
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.680]   are worth paying and at some point it it probably because not just height you phones can get
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.080]   ridiculously thin with headset jacks but it goes deep into the machine and it takes up
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.920]   space and now they're putting taptic engines and all sorts of other things and those devices
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.240]   spaces is even more to ridiculous premium than it ever was so I'm sure they're experimenting
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:01.080]   with this and again I forget which phone was I had an HTC phone a while ago that several
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.560]   years ago that had this little HTC port at the bottom in a breakout box that had four
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.440]   or five cables coming out of it and you'd plug things into there and it was ridiculous but
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.000]   mean people do ship those kind of things.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.640]   Well remember the first iPhone also required a dongle yes for the dumbest possible reason
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   which is the most the cases still do.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:23.000]   Yeah it's like the we want the curve to it would offend us to have a flat part on this
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.200]   curved case so we're going to force people to have to use our special headphones or to
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:34.960]   carry an analog dongle so it would also add to the cost of headphones because you'd have
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.120]   to have an A to D or a D to A converter built into the headphone which means Apple couldn't
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.680]   bundle an expensive white earpuds in there.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:47.360]   I think you have this will lead to audio as a standard on iOS.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.640]   I think they would bundle lightning headphones in there.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.120]   They have to because I mean you're not going to buy a phone that doesn't have its own headphones
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.480]   not especially if they're non-standard.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.240]   By the way that would get rid of some of the complaint right?
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.760]   Well it comes with headphones at work.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.680]   But they get lost you wash them through the pants and you they get the cables get frayed
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.960]   you have to replacement some point and a lot of people will just that they have a large
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.840]   Christmas tree ornament collection of nothing but unused iPhone head buds.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.080]   Why do you have everyone they have?
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.080]   I don't know.
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.320]   They just have their preferred headphones.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.840]   Only Apple had a headset company.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.440]   Well that actually made audio as opposed to a lifestyle brand.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.440]   This isn't new.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:39.640]   I mean Apple patented this and made it possible and one company made headphones that use the
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.400]   lightning connected the Fidelity headphones from Philips no evidence that they're in any
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.000]   way a better headphone.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.240]   But it's like the home button thing I mean like Apple prototypes everything and eventually
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.880]   one year we will have a completely flat piece of glass like an iron man or like an avatar
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:57.120]   and everything will be wireless and holographically projected.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.200]   I believe that I believe wireless more than lightning connected headphones.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.640]   I feel like that's really what Apple watch has no headset.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.360]   Yeah they would just assume you're going to be wireless.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.360]   Exactly.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.840]   Because they're ready so you might as well it's probably going to be aligned.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.760]   And I can see Apple you know is the same well you can still use your wireless one.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.240]   The problem really is is that Bluetooth kind of things.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.240]   It doesn't work well.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.240]   It doesn't work well.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.240]   It's like it.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:25.040]   I charge every couple years I get a new like Bluetooth you know headset just to try for
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.000]   phone calls and it's just the clicking and I use wired ones.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   I use wire ones.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   Me too.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   Me too.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.720]   Just put my emotics in there the sound either good headphones and I can make phone calls
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.720]   with them.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.440]   Apple has a strong might as well culture like the Mac book was their idea of what could
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.160]   you do if you had no ports on a Mac and they decided they didn't you couldn't do wireless
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.600]   charging through metal back then so they had to give it one port.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.600]   So you might as well use a port that does data and power.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.720]   So this is sort of like we can have wireless headsets but we have to have one lightning
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.160]   port on there to charge things we might as well give it the ability to run headsets as
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.160]   well.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.760]   The fact that this rumor keeps your surfacing really tells you that people believe that
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.360]   Apple it's a very appily thing to do.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.200]   My suggestion this isn't Curtis B and our charm says why don't they bundle headphones
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.560]   that are wireless that recharge just like the pencil does through the lightning port.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.600]   That might be kind of that might actually be kind of a cool product if they could get
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.600]   it to work right.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.800]   Might be prototypes like that already.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.720]   I mean they they try almost.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.720]   It's an interesting thesis.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:32.280]   Apple music is coming to Sonos by the way good news I think many of us are Sonos fans
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:37.520]   but one of the you know and that Sonos does Spotify title and few other services Google
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:42.720]   music Amazon music but Apple music was missing it won't be for long December.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:50.600]   What is it 15 to think two weeks from now they said Sonos will add Apple music capability.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.440]   So Apple and Sonos seem like kind of natural partners they both met to Android before
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:55.840]   it got to Sonos Leo.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:03.880]   I actually use Google Play music and cast it to my Sonos which I really I'm I'm I have
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:09.000]   to say I'm not an Apple music subscriber I stuck with both Sonos and Google Google Play
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.840]   music but I still use it because there's nothing in the world better for me than just saying
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.040]   Siri play me whatever whatever I want to hear and it just does it.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.600]   Well as I mentioned before the show I I broke down about a ridiculously expensive speaker
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.280]   that uses airplay.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.920]   And that should work better than Bluetooth once you get the speaker paired into your Wi-Fi
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:32.200]   if you got a decent Wi-Fi signal wherever it's going to be that's your device.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.960]   And even does Wi-Fi direct which is very good.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.560]   Yeah does it does the L and A and yeah and they look like the old JBL speakers.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.440]   Oh I guess his grew up with damn you Leo damn you.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.880]   It's ridiculously expensive this it's the JBL authentic.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.680]   No but it does have a ground wire for your FONO plug.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680]   Nice.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680]   It has a FONO plug.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.680]   You consider that you're going to have to move to reel to reel to start spinning more money.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:00.160]   Oh I want to reel to reel.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:04.440]   I have been thinking about buying film cameras so there is something in there.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.120]   Lisa said why don't we have a turntable I said are you kidding?
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.040]   Is this a joke?
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.760]   Then we'd have to buy records.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.520]   And digitize them all.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:20.680]   But it would be kind of fun to have an old turntable one of those you know with a Stanton
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.720]   cartridge one of those techniques direct drive turntable.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.720]   I can have my phone.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.600]   I can have a phone play.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.720]   The only time I ever wish I had a turntable is when I go through my storage unit I find
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:36.320]   that Mel Brooks album that I have that is on vinyl and is never ever ever appeared even
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.240]   as a bootleg anywhere as far as I can find.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.120]   And the thing is that the three or four albums that I want but can't find anywhere.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.200]   There are a lot of other albums it's okay.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.120]   I have to say that happens less to me in audio than it does in video but there are a lot
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:56.600]   of movies that are not in digital form in any way which means you'd have to buy a DVD.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.520]   Well they're digital in DVD but you'd have to buy a DVD.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.520]   And I don't want to buy a DVD.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:03.320]   I really don't.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.320]   Sorry.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.200]   Any more than I want to buy a vinyl record.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.200]   It's kind of the end.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.880]   I think I had kids at just the right time where they kept on putting quarters and all
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.760]   kinds of other stuff into the DVD player and breaking it.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.360]   It was just like the right time after buying like the third one I was like I'm not going
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.360]   to do this anymore.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360]   I'm done.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360]   No more physical.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.360]   I'm toured in our chair.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.040]   I'm turning into a hipster after the turntable and film camera.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.560]   All I need is a beard and a turtleneck of the transformation.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.400]   With beard oil.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.400]   With beard oil.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.400]   Pop or amounts of beard oil.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.400]   Ooh.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.960]   I don't want a shiny beard.
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.040]   Just keep glitter out of it and we'll be okay.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:42.000]   You got to cut that hair short on the side.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   You got to spike it up a little on the top.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   Get a big beard.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.640]   Too old for that.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.080]   I am actually now.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.440]   I have completed 60 years on the planet.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.880]   59 years I'm in my 60th year on the planet.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:57.880]   I don't.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.880]   It is too late.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.880]   We had a happy birthday Leo.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.880]   Thank you.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.920]   I don't celebrate for obvious reasons.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.240]   Lisa did it enough for you.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.240]   She was very sweet.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240]   She was very celebrate.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.240]   And we're doing a part.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:14.120]   We're going to Lucco Las Vegas for a night on Thursday.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.120]   For my birthday.
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.680]   We're going to see a Cirque de Soleil show.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.320]   We're going to see the sexy one.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.320]   Exhilar.
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.320]   Zumati.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   Oh.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320]   Oh.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:26.160]   And she said, and I got us the sofa seats.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.120]   You know what?
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.120]   I went to it.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:35.840]   I had never been to a Cirque de Soleil and that's the, I would take it by it for a junket.
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:40.000]   I went there and both my brother and I were just kind of like, you know, like we were
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.640]   like, is this what they're all like?
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:42.640]   Yes.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   It's amazing.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.880]   And though if you're only, they're all good, but if you're only get to see one, the Beatles
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.960]   love is, it's in Vegas.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.120]   It's a permanent show in Vegas is incredible.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.120]   It's incredible.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.960]   I remember, you know, I saw the first, first six, first place 20 years ago in San Francisco
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.160]   and at 10 when they, when they first started coming around, it was blown away.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.680]   I was talking to someone else who runs a circus.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:09.200]   They said they basically changed all of circus because it's, it's, they, it's so difficult
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:13.800]   now to get circus performers because they have so many money is all circus away.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:18.600]   And then everything else is, you know, they have to, everybody else has to fight over,
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.800]   you know, the everything else, you know, that.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.840]   Well, and then they took the next step, which is they, they started building these permanent
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.840]   installations in Vegas.
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.480]   And when they build the stage, they can make it even better.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:34.520]   So, uh, ca, the stage starts flat and turns sideways and the performers are climbing up
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.280]   sideways in, oh, it's, they're in water.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.400]   Um, it used to be in Montreal in our backyard.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.400]   I know it's local.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.480]   There's a local, it's a local group.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.480]   Thank you, Montreal.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.960]   Nothing, nothing better to do in the winters.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.120]   Think of this incredible.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.000]   It's great theater.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.080]   Um, anything else to say before we take a break and do our picks, sketch left the Mac
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.720]   App Store and a lot of angst.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.160]   Sketch was, of course, one of the companies that was bitching about the iOS App Store
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.640]   saying we can never make our product, uh, appropriately priced in, uh, for the iPad
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.680]   Pro because nobody's going to pay 99 bucks without trying before they buy.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.200]   And then we just, we can't do it.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.800]   So now they've even left the Mac App Store, which is sad.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.640]   It's like DB edit and Coda and a couple others.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.200]   Some of the best, um, see, but it's not such a big deal on the Mac because you can still
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:26.600]   download them.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:31.920]   I don't, I don't, is the Mac App Store such a great boon that you go, oh, that's too
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.920]   bad.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:36.160]   It's, for customers, it's nice because when you install a new Mac, you just launch the
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.320]   Mac App Store and we download a bunch of stuff that you don't have to worry about.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:43.120]   Like I forget what someone on Twitter was saying that they just, um, they had, they,
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.120]   they got a password.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.120]   They had to call in.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.680]   They had to read out a 54 character number to get their activation key and the Mac apps,
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:53.320]   I remember once with Adobe, I had to call in and press a secret leaf in the logo to reveal
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.800]   a number to give to them to get an activation code.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   Oh, God.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   It's crazy.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   It prevents all that sort of stuff from happening.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.800]   No more dongles.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:06.320]   So if, if an application costs less than $100, I have, and it's not in the App Store, I have
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.120]   to really need it.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.480]   Like, like, it just, it just like I look at it.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.480]   Really?
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.120]   And it comes down to, it comes down to the computer.
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.560]   I get, I go, I change computers a lot.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.280]   And so being able to just go to another computer and hit it the night, you know, the night
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.280]   I get it and I get up in the morning and all my apps are back on it.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.560]   And then there's the handful of the stupid little apps that I can't, that I have to now
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.520]   go and download and put passwords in.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:33.920]   Remember where that password was and, and then, you know, not, you know, it's two or three
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.320]   more hours of my time that I don't want to spend.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.320]   Well, I'm, I'm, I'm the exact opposite.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:43.880]   I said, I configure so few Macs over the course of the year that it's a big convenience to
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:47.880]   have everything from the Mac App Store, but it's not so inconvenient.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.840]   And after I've spoken with enough developers about how frustrated they are with the App Store
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.360]   experience that I kind of enjoy.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:58.840]   If it's, if it's a serious amount of money, if for the only reason that I'd like to, for
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:03.320]   them to get the entire $40, I'd like to, or I'd like them to get the entire $100, I'd
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.640]   like them to know who I am that I'm using their product and have that sort of relationship
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   direct with it.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:13.320]   I really think that Apple's, I tweeted about this this morning that I think they're, they're
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:18.080]   nearing a Vatican II sort of moment where they're just going to have to spend a long
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:22.920]   amount of time having conversations and trying to figure out how do we move forward?
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.120]   What, what of, what of this doctrine has worked?
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.440]   We have a mission.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:29.880]   What of this doctrine is helping us with this mission and what of this doctrine is just
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:35.760]   outdated and is holding us back because there, it's just every, every conversation I have
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:39.400]   with developers about the Apple store, about the App Store stops.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:43.160]   It's, it's stopped becoming all well, which, well, this is a hassle, but I wish we could
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.640]   do it this way and down to my God.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:51.040]   If I, if I only had to not deal with the App Store, here's how much more resources I would
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.400]   have, here's how much better my life would be.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.720]   And I'm seriously considering dropping App Store support because it's just becoming too
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.720]   much of a hassle.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:03.800]   I've read a good article though that pointed out, because, you know, one of the things,
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:07.240]   really not the most important thing, but one of the things some developers complain about
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:10.960]   is Apple's 30% cut.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.080]   But the guy pointed out, remember before the App Store, you had to go to a distributor,
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.160]   you had to get shell space.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.160]   It was hard to distribute.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.640]   Yeah, we saw it was 55%.
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.720]   But before the App Store, George W. Bush was president.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:23.720]   Yeah, no, I know.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:27.800]   Or before the App Store, you know, you couldn't make, you couldn't make an iPhone with a color
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.800]   screen.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.600]   Time moves on.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.760]   And now this is a world in which you can actually sell things easily with it.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.640]   You can set up a digital storefront in about 30 minutes and have, and start taking credit
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.760]   card transactions in an instant.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.800]   And so this, these are the questions that Apple should be asking themselves and developers
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:48.240]   and now asking themselves that if we're asked it was beyond our capacity five years ago,
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:53.360]   or 10 years ago, to start to be our own storefront, now we can do that in 20 minutes.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.760]   And what is Apple giving us?
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.560]   And what is Apple giving our users in exchange for all the stuff that we're supposed to be
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.560]   doing here?
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:04.080]   I think if developers do that, they really need to spend, get ready to spend the money
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.920]   that it takes to make it a good experience for the consumer.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:09.880]   Because I think that one of the big problems is is that all these little developers have
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.000]   all these funky ways that they want to deal with their little passwords and their little
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.680]   security and everything else.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.960]   And it just makes it a pain in the ass.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:22.080]   And the thing is that if I have any choice of one that's in the app store and one that
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.000]   looks very similar off the app store, I'm not going to pick the one off the app store
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.680]   because I know that I'm not going to know where that password went or I have to type
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.880]   in a whole bunch of things and I have to do all this stuff to protect it.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:38.320]   We sold an app without any password, without any security and we made a lot of money because
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:42.320]   it was easy and people, I'm sure there was some piracy.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.760]   But it was, and I would have happily sold that through the app store and give it up 30%.
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.600]   And I'm sure I would have made more money selling it that way.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.560]   We didn't bother with all the passwords.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:26:00.360]   And I think that's the number one thing is just all of the dealing with the install process
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.120]   is what makes the app store compelling.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:07.640]   And there are some developers that make that really easy and some developers that haven't
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.320]   upgraded that in the last 10 years.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320]   And I just don't feel bad about not buying their software.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.920]   If they're not going to, they're going to keep on using CODG or whatever that thing is.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.720]   It's not that hard.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:21.760]   I had a separate brand new Mac just a few weeks ago.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.120]   And every time that I had an app that wasn't purchased through the app store, these are
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:31.240]   good like top drawer professional apps and there's a registration menu item and there's
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.040]   a button next to that saying, "Oh, look up my registration code for me."
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.440]   And every single time.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.920]   All the ones that I was using, every single time, 10 seconds later, there was copy and
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.960]   paste it from Firebox.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:50.160]   And you also forget about their tangible rewards for the user to get stuff through the app
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.160]   store, being able to get back up and running quickly is one of them.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:59.200]   But when the tangible rewards of being able to buy things off the app store is, here we
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.200]   go.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.360]   It works perfectly for 30 days.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.080]   No feature is disabled.
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.720]   Slide for yourself if it's worth $40 or $50.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.920]   We will not disable the feature that lets you export files into a format that you can
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.000]   deal with.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.120]   But take your time and figure out if this is worth $40 to $100 of your money.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:23.840]   And I'm most concerned with iOS because now we finally have an iPad that is for a lot
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.840]   of users, myself included, a really credible productivity machine.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:31.520]   And you hear a bunch of developers saying that, "Why would I want to put all of that
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:36.040]   resources into creating a real professional productivity app for the iPad when I can't
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.840]   get more than five bucks for it?"
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.360]   So that's why compared to Vatican II, it's not one problem.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:48.200]   It's like there needs to be a long conversation about a long list of topics that leads to everyone
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:51.440]   deciding here's how we should do business in the future.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:54.200]   I think I find interesting is I think that they both suffer from the same problem.
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.200]   I think the iPad suffers from being in the shadow of the iPhone.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.360]   I think the Mac App Store suffers from being in the shadow of the App Store.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:04.240]   And I think that one of the big classic problems we have is that everyone is telling developers
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.640]   included and I love developers and I want their apps, but they've fallen to the classic
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.440]   trap of telling Apple solutions that they want instead of problems that they have.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.920]   But the biggest problem of all is that there's no discussion happening, there's nobody listening.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:19.120]   And I think none of these problems will get solved until there is a person who is directly
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.160]   responsible for the Mac App Store and for the App Store in general, whose only job it
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.800]   is is to make these things better.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.520]   Because otherwise you're shipping an iPhone every year and that makes eight to zillion
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.760]   dollars and that's all that you have time for.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.720]   And unless there's a person and a team that is only whose only job it is is to do this,
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.800]   this does not get done.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.440]   It's like, oh iTunes is terrible.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.600]   We should debundle iTunes while they debundle it for the Mac App Store, they debundle it
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:41.600]   for iBooks.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.000]   Those apps haven't had any attention either.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.680]   Just all these things like they should do this or they should do that unless there's a
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.760]   conversation happening and somebody at Apple whose job it is to make that terrific.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.480]   I think the conversation is an empty air.
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:58.640]   This is the sort of thing that kind of gets me bummed out though that we keep talking
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:03.200]   about this 200 billion dollars in cash that Apple has to say nothing of other firepower
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.360]   that they have.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:08.240]   They should be, if Apple Music is not working, they should fix it.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:11.800]   If the developer relationship isn't working, they should fix it.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:17.520]   This stuff about, my perception is the same as yours that Apple has a limited amount of
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.040]   focus and attention that they really feel as though they have to be.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:24.880]   They can't be distracted from this one thing that's really, really important to deal with
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:25.880]   this other thing.
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.680]   But they are not a plucky little startup.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680]   They're not going.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.360]   They're not excited about how maybe having a profitable quarter.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.560]   They are a monster.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.000]   They are a powerhouse.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.600]   They can accomplish anything they want to do including making a brand new campus shape
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.200]   like a spaceship.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.680]   If they say that they can't fix this problem, there's a certain element to which they don't
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.640]   feel as though it's worth making a priority.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.920]   And I think that I think they're looking at billions of dollars people are spending on
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:55.720]   the app stores and they're going, well, it's working for somebody.
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:00.880]   And I think a lot of it is figuring out a way to make it work as a developer.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.640]   Again, we were a developer for quite some time.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:10.640]   I developed a couple pieces of software and we're about to do a lot more of it.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.280]   So we look at this a lot.
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:14.000]   We talk about it internally.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.640]   And what we're looking at is, okay, what does the playground look like and how do I
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.200]   take advantage of that?
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:24.680]   This is the playground I wish I had over here, which I think a lot of developers that complain
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680]   about it.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:26.880]   And I want a playground that doesn't exist.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:32.400]   There is a playground there and the key is to figure out how to maximize your output,
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.360]   not complain about why it's not there.
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.400]   I mean, and I'm sure that they can make it better, but I think that there's a lot of
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.840]   money flowing through that store.
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.280]   And a lot of it's figuring out how to do that.
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.760]   And it may mean that they have to do things other than just develop related to marketing,
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:49.320]   related to the process, related to all of those things to get full advantage out of it.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:54.600]   But as we develop the apps that we're working on for next year, we're not looking for something
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.720]   other than what's already there.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:59.280]   Let's take a break.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.520]   Come back with your picks of the week.
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:05.280]   Gentlemen, start your picks.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:08.880]   Our show is brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.320]   Now is the time because of course there's new iPhones.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.920]   There are new iPads.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:15.920]   That means two things.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:21.800]   One, you may want to be upgrading, which means you go to Gazelle to sell your old device.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.320]   You can go there right now and get a quote.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.320]   Good for 30 days.
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.600]   It's nice because it gives you time to get the new device, transfer the data over, or
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:30.400]   even change your mind because you're not locked in.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.400]   They are.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:37.080]   But it also means there's going to be a lot more certified pre-owned devices in the Gazelle
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.080]   store.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.520]   Yeah, Gazelle sells as well as buying.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.880]   And they have an incredible selection of pre-owned devices.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:47.360]   Right now at a great price, the 4S to the 6 Plus for iPads.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:52.840]   We got the standard, the air, the mini Android users might want to look at the Galaxy phones
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.840]   there.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.320]   And if it's great, you're getting a great price for a pre-owned device.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:01.560]   But of course Gazelle puts them through a very rigorous 30-point inspection.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.560]   And you have 30 days.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.000]   There's 30-day return policy means there's no risk.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   All the devices are sold without a carrier contract and they are available to run on
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.480]   all the major carriers, networks, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:19.320]   You could even choose what condition it's in, three different conditions.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:23.080]   So you want to pay a little more to get a like new device you can if you want to save
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.080]   a little more.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.440]   Maybe it's for your kid.
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.360]   Maybe it's the third phone they've broke.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.360]   This is a great place to go.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.760]   G-A-Z-E-W-L-E Gazelle.com.
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.640]   Sell your old device.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.640]   Fast turnaround.
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.000]   They'll wipe the data if you forget and they'll pay in.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.800]   Check a PayPal credit or bump it up 5% and send you an Amazon gift card.
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.800]   I love that for this holiday buying season.
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.200]   To buy to sell Gazelle.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:54.840]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.480]   Pick of the week time.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:58.080]   This time we'll start with Alex Lindsay.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.960]   I usually end with him because he's got the most expensive.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:08.080]   But I have a pick that's actually more than an Alex.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.080]   That's crazy talk.
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.080]   Crazy talk.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:16.240]   So actually this is a good example of an app that spent some money on.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:20.200]   And this is, Leo you've been playing with the theta, right?
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.760]   I love my theta.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:22.760]   I am really.
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:23.760]   I love my theta.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.760]   Now you explained to me last week why the theta video, this is the immersive video camera.
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.360]   The theta S is the latest version from Rico.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.200]   350 bucks.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.240]   The images are HD and they look great.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:38.800]   And it's one shot to get a 360 degree panel.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.680]   But the video, which is also 360 degrees, is a little softer.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:44.040]   And you explained that it's just not enough resolution.
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:45.040]   Right.
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.280]   And it's going to keep on getting better.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:53.440]   So you know, the the the the the the the the theta S is of course 1080p.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.520]   It's going to get you know, I would assume that next year it'll be 4k.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.400]   I mean, the new the Kodak 260 or 360 or whatever they were the 240.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.400]   Now is I just saw one in in Akihabara that is 4k.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.880]   I was like, oh, I'm gonna.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.120]   You're not going to recommend the new Nokia Oso are you?
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.520]   I'm not because that's that's I would win for most expensive.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.280]   It's a thousand indexes 60 grand.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.200]   And I have I have played with it a little bit.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:24.160]   And in the footage, I have to say is some of the best virtual reality footage.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.160]   You know, sure.
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.160]   You have played with it.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.160]   Wow.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.160]   Oh, I've gotten to touch it.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.160]   I haven't gotten this guy actually.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.760]   It's got eight 2k cameras on it.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760]   Yes.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.280]   And it and it's the 3D is not something that jumps out at you.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.240]   It is a it's a great it's a really great camera.
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.560]   And I'm hoping to do some projects with it next year.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.360]   But the but it'll be more of a rental item.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.360]   Yes.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:51.000]   So the but anyway, so that the theta is great in one of the things that I mentioned when
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.880]   we were talking about the theta the last time was that I really wish that someone would
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:58.000]   build an app that does HDR and turns out someone had.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.400]   Oh, so, oh, exciting.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:05.560]   So this is called it's called HDR 360.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.440]   And and there's two of them there.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.520]   There's one that's a little less expensive called HDR theta HDR, which doesn't really
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:11.520]   work.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.160]   I'm not going to get the theta HDR because I can't get it to actually connect to the
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.160]   camera.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:20.920]   But but theta the HDR 360 is a little bit more expensive for an iPhone app.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:21.920]   It's 50 bucks.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:24.640]   It's bracket pro.
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.960]   It is from Brad Herman.
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:28.040]   Yes, that's it.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:29.040]   Okay.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.200]   It's hard when it's on my phone.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.200]   It's called HDR 360.
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:34.480]   So so but that's the one that that's there and it should be up.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.960]   I think it's 49.99 whatever.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.680]   And what's great about it is you have a lot of control.
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.600]   You can set up your brackets image count connects to the phone.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:43.600]   Great.
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.960]   And what it does is then shoots it shoots all the images.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.800]   It doesn't really build the HDR, but it shoots those those 360 images that you need.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:52.040]   So if you are now what this is really useful for a half to be.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.760]   I don't know who else would use this other than a visual effects person.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:00.160]   But if you want to build a well one way if you wanted to build a tone mapped image of
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.880]   a scene that that just isn't you know, there's too much bright areas or dark areas and you
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:12.160]   want to do kind of the that tone mapped look, but put it into your Google cardboard or your
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:17.200]   Samsung, you know, your VR or Oculus, you could, you know, you could build these images and
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.200]   do that.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:21.280]   And so if you're a visual effects artist, you could build really good reflection maps,
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.400]   which is what I'm mostly interested in.
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:28.440]   So anyway, so it's a it's a really cool app and it works.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.720]   This is the best part.
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:32.960]   And anyway, so it's I'm having a lot of fun with it.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.120]   So that's the that's that's my big feeling.
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:37.080]   You just spent 50 bucks a mine.
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:40.440]   I mean, if I have the theta, I should probably have this app.
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.440]   Right.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.440]   And then the key is you want to put it on a tripod.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.440]   You're not going to want to hold it.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:46.160]   Yeah, it does take a little tripod for it.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.160]   So there's a couple seconds between each exposure.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.840]   So it's still, you know, the, you know, it's not something that's going to capture video
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.840]   or you're not going to put it in a restaurant.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:56.680]   But if you're trying to capture a scene and get that HDR and then you can take it to any,
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.400]   you know, then it just shows up in your photo library.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.920]   You can take any of those and pull them together and use your favorite HDR app to the time together.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:05.960]   And it does have a little preview in there so you can see what you did to see if you got
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:06.960]   what you needed.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:07.960]   So wait a minute.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.960]   I have to understand the workflow.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:14.720]   So normally with the theta, I copied off the camera and imported the theta's spherical
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.320]   program, which turns it into a sphere.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.120]   And what you would do before you did that is throw the unwrapped images.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:25.680]   Those images are are just these, you know, you just do my one images.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.680]   Fish.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:28.680]   Well, they're not round.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:31.240]   They're they're like an opened unwrapped.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.240]   So unwrap it still.
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.240]   It'll be an unwrapped still.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:39.520]   We take still run that through your take the non HDR program exposures or whatever, take
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.120]   it into your HDR program and combine them and then then when you're done with that,
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:49.320]   then you can then you then you put it in the theta software and it turns out.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.320]   Yes.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.320]   And I haven't put it in the theta software.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.320]   I've only just put it.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.400]   I would just it should still work, right?
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:56.360]   I mean, it wouldn't make it should work fine.
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.360]   Okay.
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.760]   So it's taking how many it's can do as many as nine.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.720]   I think it does more than nine.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.160]   I'm doing nine because that's what I've done in the past, but it has one that has one that
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.160]   says 19.
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.680]   So that's that's being that's like getting everything that would possibly be there for
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.680]   the most tone mapping.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.800]   You could probably do three and you'd be you'd be happy.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.320]   You know, three or five.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.320]   It takes a lot less time.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.800]   And the reason that lost the last time it's not just convenience.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:24.160]   It's just that there's less chance of things moving around and everything else as well.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.160]   So that that's another advantage.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:28.480]   I have to try this.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.480]   Thank you for your pick.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:31.560]   I'm very rich.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:37.640]   So every time I put up a picture or I do a review and I have a leather cuff band in the
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.280]   photo, people ask me where I get it from.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.880]   And my answer is ludicrous.
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:44.560]   So I went and looked for an alternative for people who don't want to buy a Hermes watch.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.560]   Is yours the Hermes?
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.080]   Yes, the Hermes fancy boy.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:49.080]   It just it's so uniquely.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:50.080]   Oh, I came.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.480]   It's really pretty.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:55.280]   I actually I actually think it makes the Apple watch much better.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.840]   It's a great looking tough, but it's not a reasonable purchase because you can't buy
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.840]   it separately.
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.360]   You have to buy it with a watch and people who are asking, but Pat and Quill has just
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.360]   put out a new series of leather stuff.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.640]   Their stuff is phenomenal.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:12.520]   They have iPad Pro cases now too, but these are really, really good looking cuffs and unlike
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.440]   the Hermes one, they come in a variety of colors.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:17.600]   They don't just come in the beige color, but there's a black and there's a deep brown
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.600]   as well.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.760]   And a lot of like there there've been some set aftermarket cuffs, but when you really
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.400]   look at them, they're either not double layer or the stitching is not very good.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:29.120]   And Pat and Quill really sweats the details.
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:30.400]   They're also they're not as cheap.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.800]   Some of the Amazon places you can buy, but they're way better quality.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:37.600]   They have very nice stitching, very nice work and Brian at Pat and Quill really cares
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.120]   about the quality of the stuff that they're selling to and like the Hermes watch, it's
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.120]   cut out.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.120]   So the sensors still works.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:45.440]   The heart rate sensor still works.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.000]   I'm not sure the Hermes one, you could actually pull out and use it as a regular or single
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.240]   tour if you want to in this.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:53.120]   I haven't tried it yet, but it appears to me like you could do the same thing, which
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.120]   is sort of like getting two watches in one.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.080]   You get the cuff and you get the single tour at the same time.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.160]   And their leather work is just so, so good.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.760]   And if you're interested, there's a little video in there that you can once you see the
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.880]   web page, you can go to it.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.640]   Brian shows off all the details about it.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.880]   You can get an American tan, Galloper black or chestnut.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.880]   It's super great.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.880]   Mm.
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:14.880]   I'm tempted.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.080]   And we take that hipster watch of mine and make it look manly.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's a really great look and it's a really great feel.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.960]   I have their iPhone six case.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:24.960]   I just love their work.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.960]   I really love their work.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:26.960]   It's craft work.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:30.400]   Well, yeah, you can tell it's like somebody made it.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.320]   Like a human, not a machine.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.800]   Only for the 42 millimeter.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:38.560]   Yeah, I'm hoping that we get more diverse.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:41.760]   So far, the double tours only for the small ones and the cuffs are only for the big ones.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.360]   I'm hoping that changes because there are people of all sorts of different shapes and
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.560]   sizes who have different tastes.
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:49.640]   But if you've been looking for a cuff and you want to get something from a really good
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.440]   manufacturer, then this is definitely the one to get.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.880]   It's a whole ween leather.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.880]   So it's going to be nice.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.880]   I don't know which I would get.
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:56.880]   I probably get the chestnut.
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.360]   They all look great.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:02.520]   I think sometimes I'd like the black because it goes with everything, but then sometimes
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.960]   having a little bit of color is nice.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.400]   I like leather to look a little more like leather.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.400]   Yes.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:09.400]   You can be in a Jones.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   Like in the end of Jones, I want everything to be leather.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:12.400]   Exactly.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.400]   Mr.
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:21.960]   By the way, that is pad P and D Q U I L L pad and quill.com and they do great stuff.
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:26.360]   129 95 pre-order now.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:29.240]   Yes, sir, Mr. Andy and not co.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:32.280]   A couple of updates for my pick.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:37.480]   One reader on Twitter was nice enough to tell us that someday Christmas is in Apple
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:38.480]   music.
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.760]   So if you go search for that, you can go grab it 99 cents.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:43.960]   That's the Stevie Wonder song.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:44.960]   Okay.
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:46.440]   See, you wonder under a song.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.440]   Who is she?
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.440]   Who is Andrew?
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.440]   Whatever.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:53.240]   I heard of her before, but I went from that to searching for her and now owning her latest
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.240]   album.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.040]   She has an amazing voice.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.920]   Secondly, another delighted reader fixed my Apple pencil for me.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:06.800]   He suggested that he had the same problem and it was because the tip was loose.
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.560]   So why don't I try tightening it?
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.840]   That didn't work, but what did work was actually unscrewing and removing it completely and
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.280]   then putting it back on.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:16.720]   What the what?
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:17.720]   And now it works fine.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:22.840]   Well, that's a tip that I should pass on to other people that if you if you if it ever
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:27.320]   goes dead, stick on your tribe, removing the tip and then putting it back in and maybe
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.320]   it will come back to life.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:29.320]   Thank you so much.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:33.000]   James Stone was the reader who said that.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.560]   But onto the actual pick of the week.
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.320]   Of course, we talked early about a cooking turkey sous vide and this was the lightsaber
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.920]   like device that makes it happen.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.800]   This is a this is a sous vide cooker.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.840]   If you haven't seen it yet, it's a what what you just get a stock pot or any sort of water
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:52.360]   vessel, fill it with water.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:57.280]   This has both the heating element, a sensor and a little motor circulator that you drop
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:02.880]   it in there, tap in a tap in a temperature and started started going and then put your
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:07.040]   meat or vegetables in a sealed plastic bag inside that water bath.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:13.680]   What happens is that it can cook it to temperature without having to gently and consistently.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:18.160]   So instead of cooking chicken to 165 degrees, which makes it like all dried out, you can
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:22.080]   actually cook it at like 130 135 degrees.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.000]   But instead of cooking it for 20 minutes, you're cooking it for an entire hour or two
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.480]   hours.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:32.560]   And it really results in like just immensely tender, juicy, succulent meat.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.080]   That's your turkey.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.080]   Look at that.
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.240]   That was that was that was a close up of my turn.
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:42.040]   I was just the best probably the best turkey I ever had.
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:48.360]   So many so many reasons to recommend sous vide part of them being that it's not this year
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:53.280]   when you bake and when you cook in an oven, you have to keep an eye on the temperature
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:57.480]   of the of the meat and make sure you pull it out before it gets all overcooked and dry
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.880]   because it's always being cooked at 135 degrees.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.480]   It can never be more than 135 degrees.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:06.900]   So the your the the meat is done in about an hour.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:10.680]   But if you stick if you keep it in there for another hour or two hours, that's fine.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:11.680]   Or two days.
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:12.680]   What?
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:18.760]   The big thing is it will just keep on softening the meat.
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:24.160]   In fact, if you leave it if you forget like me for five days, it will defy the beat.
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.960]   Oh, oh, oh, but you can but it does mean for instance, you can buy like a lesser cut
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.520]   of meat that has more flavor in it.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:37.320]   That's you normally wouldn't buy because it's too it's too tough, but you keep it in the
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.320]   sous vide for a couple of hours and becomes as tender as as as as a or you could do what
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:43.320]   I do.
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:45.120]   Just take it in the bathtub with you for a while.
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.120]   Exactly.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.000]   It's good if you're forgetting a whole go flavor.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000]   So flavor.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.680]   You might want to like, you know, make sure you give the tub a good scrubbing after that.
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:57.120]   No, I know that when I cooked my turkey, it said don't take it out of the oven until
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.880]   it's 165 degrees.
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:01.760]   Does it kill the bacteria?
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:02.760]   Yes, it does.
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:07.160]   It's it's a different kind of math where imagine trying to imagine trying to kill James
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:08.760]   Bond with heat.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:09.760]   Okay.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:15.360]   You can either lock him inside a sauna that's at 180 degrees or you can basically put him
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:22.120]   into like a plasma emitter, you know, at 2000, 20,000 degrees, the 20,000 degree plasma
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:24.080]   chamber will kill him immediately.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.800]   The sauna at 200 degrees will kill him after two or three out.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:28.800]   I see.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:30.000]   That's that's what you're doing here.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.680]   I see the way that the way that the food safety temperatures are calculated.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:38.880]   It's I'm not I don't have the actual numbers in front of me, but it comes down to at 165
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:42.840]   degrees, all the things that you want to kill will be dead within five minutes.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.040]   No, Mr. Bird.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.240]   I expect you to die.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.240]   Exactly.
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.240]   Thank you.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.440]   At 135 degrees, they die off, but at a slower rate.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:56.160]   And by the time you've had it's been at that temperature for 20 minutes or 30 minutes,
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.960]   which is what happens after it's been in there for more than an hour or so, then you've got
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:04.520]   the same level of no undesirable.
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:09.600]   Undesirable have been killed off and it's safe to believe me the first time that you
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:12.920]   cut into a chicken breast that is pink in color.
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:13.920]   Yes, nerve wrecking.
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:19.120]   You'll go right back to the web page and say, okay, explain to me the science behind this
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.120]   again.
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.640]   Yeah, but it is it is perfectly safe.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.520]   This is the ANOVA Suvie cooker.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:26.520]   Really, really easy to use.
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:28.000]   It's the one that I've been using.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.720]   A lot of people swear by this one.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:30.720]   Yeah, I have that.
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:32.360]   That's the one I all three of that one.
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.600]   But that's the one I have now and I highly recommend it.
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.680]   It's dead simple and dead reliable.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:42.280]   And also with recommending because they have a they have their Black Friday Cyber Monday
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.760]   sale still going on.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.080]   It's normally about 180 bucks.
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:47.320]   You can get it for 129.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:52.960]   And the other part of the other part of cooking that was that Thanksgiving was I cooked the
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:58.040]   beans and I cooked my I cook the beans in the Suvie the day before I cooked mashed potatoes
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:01.240]   the normal way the day before sealed them up in bags.
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:04.880]   And when the the next day when the turkey was done after three hours, put those bags
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:09.960]   right back in the water, they got heated back up to temperature and that's whatever time
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.440]   I decided that I wanted to eat.
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:16.200]   I took all three bags out, cut them open and plated all three things at the exact same
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:19.480]   time, which is which is a trick that I had never been able to pull off.
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:23.520]   Thanksgiving dinner because I will never get everything done and ready at the same time.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:24.920]   Can't recommend it's high enough.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.120]   It's just absolutely brilliant.
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:27.120]   Awesome.
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:30.120]   So I'm going to take advantage of the sale just to buy another another one or two because
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:33.520]   what happens is if you have a bunch of different things, you want to have them the chicken
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:41.000]   at, you know, 145 or 150, the steak at 132 or 135, the veggies, you know, so you eventually
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.560]   want more than more than one.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.560]   Also, Leo's tub is big.
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.760]   He's going to need a couple.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.720]   And this is this is the secret behind a lot of really high-end restaurants.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:52.120]   If you actually see like the open area where they're there, what you'll see a whole bunch
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:57.040]   of these water baths and this and and and ones that are, you know, the same, not any better
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:02.240]   quality, just older that look big, like big machinery, but this was just a much more refined
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.440]   version of those.
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:07.720]   And the reason is for a rent and this is where it was invented is for a restaurant.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:10.960]   You come in and you want to steak and you want to eat it the next day.
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.440]   You know, they it's already cooked.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:16.040]   Basically, they sear it the brown and they bring it out.
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:19.520]   Another secret is that as a kid, the first time you try to make a burger, of course,
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:25.440]   you like make this two inch thick patty and you and you and you and you you you you you
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:28.440]   left on your own devices, you it's nice and brown on one side.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.360]   You flip it over, it's nice and brown the other side.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.560]   And then you put on a bun and now it's absolutely raw in the middle because it's just too thick.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.560]   Swit's sous vide.
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:38.280]   You can again, it will cook all the way through.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:40.480]   It'll be pink all the way from top to bottom.
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.800]   You slap it in a pan to brown one side the other, but that's how you get those beautiful
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.440]   like inch thick, inch and a half thick restaurant style burgers.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:51.440]   Like I said, it'll you keep it's it's like it's like owning your first chainsaw.
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:54.320]   You use it for the thing you intended to use it for.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.920]   And then you walk around the house thinking, I wonder what else I can cut with this.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.000]   So it's it's great stuff.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.040]   Well, I think you guys all rock and roll and I'm just going to show you I just wanted
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:09.800]   something that cost an Alex.
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:14.120]   But originally it cost three Alex's and the reason I'm recommending it at this point is
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:19.120]   because it's for now, finally it is an Alex one Alex down to one Alex.
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:20.680]   Hasselblad did a crazy thing.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:24.000]   They took the Sony RX 100, which is a great compact camera.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:30.280]   And they put it in a Hasselblad body with an amazing wooden grip and beautiful leather
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.760]   styling.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:36.200]   I'm just thinking if you are like Renee kind of wearing that is the Hermes of cameras.
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:39.760]   It is the Hermes tour of cameras.
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:41.880]   You can get a variety of different woods.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:43.520]   The wood grip is beautiful.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:48.200]   And because it's an RX 100, it's really it's now admittedly when it was they were trying
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:50.800]   to get 2,200 bucks for this thing.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:55.160]   That would be crazy talk as you get our RX 100 for 600, 700 bucks.
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.360]   But now that they've dropped the price to 799 at B and H by the way, this is B and H
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:02.760]   only I think because I checked on Amazon and it's still overpriced there.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.760]   Hasselblad.
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:05.600]   How do you get a Hasselblad?
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.640]   Stella special edition.
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:09.640]   But what I kind of would you want?
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:10.640]   I don't know.
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:11.640]   I'm thinking going on mahogany.
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.320]   Is there a Tic?
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:16.080]   There is a Tic I believe there's all the wood.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:17.600]   Yeah, isn't that great?
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:18.600]   There's powder.
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:19.600]   Let's sing it.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:21.840]   Bar nut, when Davelinki.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:22.840]   I've had Davelinki.
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:25.000]   This is very small.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.520]   I mean, it's it's hard.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:31.840]   You can't really tell by looking at it, but it's a really teensy, weency little thing
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.760]   with a zoom lens and it comes with a matching leather strap.
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:42.560]   It is absolutely the double tour and it comes in a nice box and that's it.
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:43.720]   Yeah, it has to.
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.040]   And I think at 800 bucks now, this is actually not overpriced anymore.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:50.680]   So I just wanted something that costs an Alex.
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:51.680]   I'm not going to buy one.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:52.680]   I got a great camera.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:55.000]   And is it one inch chip?
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000]   Is that right?
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.600]   Yeah, I think it's a one inch 20 megapixel, one inch.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:01.640]   The zoom is 28 to 100 millimeters.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:04.080]   It does do video has a lot of nice features.
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:07.200]   The RX 100 is actually a very nice little point and shoot.
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:10.440]   I have one actually already have an RX 100.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:13.160]   Although I should point out, I don't know which version.
[01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:14.920]   I think it's mark one or mark two.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:17.080]   There's Sony's up to the mark four on the RX 100 now.
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:19.480]   So you'll be getting some older technology.
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:20.760]   People ask you what it is.
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.280]   You can say, "Hassleblatt."
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:23.280]   Hassleblatt.
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:25.080]   I have a Hassleblatt.
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:26.080]   It's really teeny.
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:28.000]   It's really cute.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.560]   And actually, if you're looking for a great point and shoot, the Sony RX 100s are good
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:35.840]   and a lot less.
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:43.080]   Friends and family, thank you for joining us in our post-prandial edition of Mac Break
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.080]   Weekly.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.040]   Alex Lindsey, he is in Tokyo and is now almost done.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:51.040]   It is the sun is just.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:52.040]   It's just here.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:53.040]   Wait, hold on.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:54.040]   Hold on.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.040]   Can you move your cube?
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:56.040]   Oh my God.
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:57.040]   That is a beautiful view.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:58.040]   I am so jealous.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:00.080]   Did you say that it's your first time in Tokyo?
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.080]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:08.080]   I spent six weeks living here for a film and so I'm pretty, I actually have a lot.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.000]   I go to a lot of the same places all the time.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:11.880]   But I love to go there.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:12.880]   Well, you'll have to help me.
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:13.880]   It's amazing.
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:16.640]   And I'll be doing some kind of meet up on Saturday.
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:17.640]   Oh good.
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:19.880]   If people follow me on Twitter, I'm going to post the location as soon as I figure it
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:22.000]   out in the next very, today.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.880]   So I'll figure it out.
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:32.200]   Twitter.com/AlexLindsay, a-l-e-x-l-i-n-d-s-a-y.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:36.400]   By the way, anova culinary.com, a-n-o-v-a culinary.com.
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.800]   I don't think we gave out the URL.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.560]   That's Andy Anako who picked it.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.880]   And all three of these guys own it, which is amazing.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:47.680]   Which made this show a lot less expensive for me since I was in Tokyo.
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:48.680]   They didn't have to buy it.
[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:50.040]   Did Andy think of it after buying another one?
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:51.040]   Andy tried.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:56.480]   Andy Anako is at the Chicago Sun, the esteemed Chicago Sun Times.
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:01.400]   You can read his writing there on his newly refreshed blog, cwob.com.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:05.640]   And always a pleasure having you here.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:06.640]   Where's the slice?
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:10.040]   And imore.com is where you'll find Renee Ritchie.
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:13.320]   Make sure you read his giant iPad Pro.
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:15.480]   It's a review as big as the iPad.
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:17.640]   You'll need the whole pro to read it.
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.960]   Ten thousand words of goodness.
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:20.960]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.600]   We do Mac break weekly, 11 a.m. Pacific.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:23.600]   Get here early.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:25.360]   Well, get here at 11.
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:28.960]   Because as we were observing today, we spent a lot of time in the beginning before the
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:29.960]   show.
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:30.960]   Best part.
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:31.960]   You know why?
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:32.960]   Because I love these guys and I love sitting down.
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:35.000]   And I always want to talk to them about all sorts of non-Mac stuff.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.600]   So that's the juicy part of the show if you ask me.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:40.280]   So get here early if you want to watch live.
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.560]   11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time.
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:46.080]   That's 1900 UTC on Twitter TV every Tuesday.
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.000]   You can also watch on demand, of course.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.040]   All of our shows are most people watch on demand.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:57.000]   Audio and video as well if you'd like to see at Twitter TV/M be a W and wherever you
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.640]   get your podcasts like Stitcher or Apple TV apps are great.
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:01.640]   And all of that.
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:02.640]   Thanks for being here.
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:03.640]   Now get back to work.
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:04.640]   You know why?
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:06.560]   Because break time is over.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:09.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:15.840]   (upbeat music)
