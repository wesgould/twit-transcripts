[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.780]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers Apple,
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.520]   Macintosh, OS X, OS 9, OS 7, System 7, iOS 7.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.380]   There's a lot of 7.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.420]   System 7.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.180]   7.1.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.180]   It was a long time ago.
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.260]   That was a big change there from System 6 to System 7.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.740]   Remember that?
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.620]   That's Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.860]   He remembers a lot.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.140]   He is, of course, with the Pixel Core.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.060]   And now his new endeavor, Rwanda Adma, the African--
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.900]   Digital Media Academy.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.380]   He did Boudalne, Nidya, Catmi.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.420]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.220]   Thank you.
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.020]   I'll be there next week.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.060]   I'll be coming in from Mac Break from Rwanda.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.560]   Thank God.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.060]   I know.
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.580]   I'm so tired of that.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.620]   He's like, he smells.
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.100]   No, no.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.900]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.860]   Actually, I've got a lot of questions for you.
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.900]   Alex Lindsey, that's Adi and Akko over here.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.780]   You've met him before.
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.420]   You have?
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.500]   Yeah, I have met that fellow.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.260]   Good looking guy.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.140]   He's got his Hayward Fire Department hat on.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.820]   There you go.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.020]   So once you've had your 12th fire,
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.900]   they give you the--
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.420]   Size.
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.900]   You get your punch card, they give you a free hat.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.420]   It turns out we hat, pair of glasses.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.900]   And also here Renee Ritchie from iMore.com, who I quote a lot.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.620]   I quoted you all week about the Greg Kaiser story.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.860]   You better have been right on that one.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.300]   All evidence of the contrary.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.340]   He was not correct.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.300]   Greg Kaiser in the computer world reported--
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.460]   and we talked about this last week--
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.180]   that Apple was no longer supporting Snow Leopard
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.060]   with security patches.
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.580]   And thank God you set me straight, Renee.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.540]   And I did apologize on Twitter for getting that wrong.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.180]   And I gave you credit for the true story.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.700]   Thank you.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.220]   So thank you.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.220]   So 7-1 is here.
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.900]   Is it all you hoped it would be?
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.260]   Let's go through a quick run through of features.
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.300]   Some cosmetic improvements.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.940]   I haven't really looked for a whole bunch of them.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.180]   But you can turn off the swooping thing in more applications,
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.860]   which is nice because the motion always--
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.140]   you notice now I don't have so much swooping as I did before.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.300]   I always turn that off.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.020]   New thing in Siri where you press the button
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.500]   to get Siri to talk.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.580]   Normally you talk and then you stop talking
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.620]   after you stop talking.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.820]   It does this search, right?
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.780]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.620]   Wow.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.180]   I don't know why it said that.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.460]   So now you can press invoke Siri and keep holding it.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.780]   It will continue to listen, even if you stop talking.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.940]   That's actually nice for people who
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.100]   would like to think while they dictate.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.100]   I have to do that often.
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.260]   Or if you're in a noisy room and a lot of people are yelling
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.980]   and you want to stop listening.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.940]   I just really--
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.500]   I felt like frequently I felt rushed by Siri.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.140]   Because the opposite of always listening from Google.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.100]   Yeah, right.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.440]   Right.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.140]   Siri only listens while you hold the button down.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.340]   And now it's going to take all of that as dictation.
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.420]   So I think that's a nice feature, kind of unexpected.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.620]   Did you know about that Renee from your beta testing with 7-1?
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.220]   I did.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.660]   And I like the fact that it's such a contrast from Google's
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.140]   approach.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.700]   In a perfect world, I'd be able to hold down and say always
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.820]   listen, and it would have that as an option.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.700]   But I like that one is always listening.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.220]   And one will only listen when you expressly toggle a physical
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.220]   button, and there is no chance of accident.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.900]   Yeah, I think that's good.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.820]   What else is new?
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.340]   Well, we know more re-springs, right?
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.020]   Have you noticed?
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.420]   I haven't seen many or any, actually, since the upgrade.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.380]   I haven't had any re-springs in a month, in two months, maybe.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.140]   Oh, you've been using 7-1 for a while.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.100]   So it does not push it, at least not yet.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.340]   So you're going to have to go to your system general.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.580]   And then in general, the software update button.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.980]   And then it will tell you 7-1 is it?
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.980]   What was really funny is that not only was there no gold
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.060]   master for this, they just dropped the public release right
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.260]   away.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.700]   But if you had the beta and you went to software update, it
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.980]   would let you update from the beta to the release version, which
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.780]   I don't remember happening previously.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.780]   What else?
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.180]   It's faster.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.100]   It's a little snappier.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.580]   Like some of the--
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.700]   I think some of the transitions are faster.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.100]   I think they shorten a lot of the transitions.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.300]   They really shaved off some of the sharp edges of this thing.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.220]   One of the things I noticed almost immediately is that now,
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.860]   when you pull down the search box from the top or pull up
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.660]   the system tray from the bottom, now there's actually
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.380]   sort of a funk, visual funk, when it's in place.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.700]   So that you don't think, oh, do I need to keep scrolling it?
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.180]   Is it only halfway in position?
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.860]   Ah, you're right.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.700]   I kill it.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.460]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.420]   They finally gave us list views and calendar.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.340]   They supposedly have fixed that problem with Gmail.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.020]   We will see if that is actually true or not.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.740]   I'm a little annoyed.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.100]   They didn't fix my little pet peeve.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.060]   See, when you pull up the system notification
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.580]   at darkens the back row, which makes it very hard to know
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.060]   what you're doing with the--
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.460]   That's the slider there.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.860]   Apparently, accessibility is the word we use for.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.460]   Yeah, we screwed that up, but we'll
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.580]   let you unscrew that if you want manually.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.860]   So one of the things you can do now
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.740]   is actually change the translucency
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.740]   so that it's almost opaque now.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.740]   Now you can--
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.900]   there are a lot of different settings like that,
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.500]   where petty annoyances that you might have had or now fixed.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.820]   You can also turn off parallel acts in certain situations,
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.420]   again, through accessibility.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.660]   And those are definitely accessibility features,
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.020]   but I think that nine out of 10 people who use them
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.820]   are going to be, oh, thank god, I always
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.820]   hated that translucency.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.100]   It's like operating a phone through a shower door,
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.100]   and I never liked that.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.260]   Where is accessibility?
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.900]   They also managed to screw up a feature that--
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.420]   it's a subtle feature.
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.500]   If you like to type letters with capital letters sometimes,
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.780]   now they've basically made it so that it's impossible to guess
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.580]   whether the shift key is engaged or not.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.180]   That was in direct response to me, wasn't it?
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.620]   Let's see.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.660]   All right, let me go--
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.620]   It was worse in the beta.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.860]   They fixed it slightly, but it's still completely
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.740]   impenetrable.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.100]   All right, here's-- so let's do a little typing.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.460]   So now I press the caps lock.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.020]   Well, that's better, isn't it?
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.020]   No.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.260]   What do you think is locked?
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.940]   What do you think the caps is on or on?
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.180]   Well, I never know, because it's always--
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.300]   oh, wait a minute.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.700]   Yeah, see?
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.700]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.540]   So that is caps lock.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.140]   White is caps lock.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.140]   Gray is not.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.980]   Oh, crap.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.660]   White is capital.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.740]   Gray is non-capital.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.460]   Double tap with a tiny line underneath his caps lock.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.860]   Oh, screw you, Apple.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.380]   Just screw you.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   It used to be blue.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.740]   It used to be so easy to see.
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.380]   Lock it up, we're done.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.860]   You know, it's so easy.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.500]   Every other operating system does this.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.540]   If you're an uppercase, show uppercase keys.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.820]   This is not a typewriter.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.940]   If you're in lowercase, show lowercase keys.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.980]   This is not a typewriter.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.940]   I was really surprised when I fired that up
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.980]   and saw that, because that's not a--
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.980]   If you made it worse.
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.820]   If you want to argue about translucency,
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.420]   that's a long, two-day discussion you have
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.380]   at a corporate retreat.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.300]   And there's no right answer.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.100]   But why did they make something that is so obviously
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.260]   confusing on such a front and center feature?
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.980]   That is so weird.
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.020]   And again, it is better than it was two betas ago.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.620]   Two betas ago, it was impossible for anyone
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.620]   to know what state it was now.
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.580]   It's just disturbing.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.980]   I think they do this to annoy me.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.460]   I'm taking this personally.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.660]   It used to be blue, worked fine.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.660]   Nobody had a problem with it.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.660]   I had a problem fixing it.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.860]   But now it's worse.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.360]   Yes.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:43.860]   OK.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.060]   Then waiting for 7.11.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.740]   Then somebody who has an office that's shaped like a pyramid
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.860]   said, wait a minute, a blue color
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.140]   is not indicative of the design intent of that schema.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.860]   You need to have-- stick to this model.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.180]   You're like, oh, man.
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.140]   I just actually--
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.700]   We're stating this.
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.180]   We actually wrote a how to-- how do you tell on IMORI yesterday,
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.820]   how do you tell what state your shift key is in,
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.700]   because nobody could tell?
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.860]   Should not need an article.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.220]   I was so embarrassed.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.100]   Should not need--
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.300]   Shouldn't need an article.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.860]   What else is the change?
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.900]   There's new telephone screens on the iPad,
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.780]   but the iPhone-- the way you answer the phone is now much better.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.940]   It got rid of those big clunky rectangles.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.340]   And you don't have elegant little circles,
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.780]   and there's a new slide to answer the phone animation
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.380]   that all looks very nice.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.980]   They've also added-- they also added what I must think
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.540]   is a privacy feature now.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.420]   When the phone rings, it doesn't fill the entire screen
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.020]   with the picture of the incoming person.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.220]   Now it does a little bit more discreetly
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.700]   so that everybody at the table doesn't know,
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.340]   oh, so you-- that's not your wife.
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.260]   Why is she holding up the picture that says--
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.100]   I love you, Josh.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.820]   She's quite lovely, isn't she?
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.300]   And young.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.620]   It also fixes the Touch ID decay.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.940]   There's a few people who would render Touch ID useless for on 7.1,
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.900]   but that's the vast majority.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.260]   For most people now, they no longer
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.580]   have that decaying Touch ID fingerprint issue.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.980]   It just keeps working.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.980]   Which is a good fix.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.940]   Yeah, so all of this you've seen because you've
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.940]   been using the beta.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.500]   Yes, iPhone 4 performance is greatly improved.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.420]   It's now usable.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.820]   Yeah, not back to 6 in a lot of cases.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.180]   So it's closer.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.220]   Yeah, well, I mean, if you were bottom of the update totem pole,
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.500]   if you were the last supported device,
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.700]   it's always been fairly horrible.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.340]   Like the iPhone 3G, it took two or three updates
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.620]   to make that device usable.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.580]   It took six months to get iOS 7.1 out.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.260]   So it's basically the same time frame,
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.220]   but I put it on mine yesterday, and it's perfectly usable now.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.460]   It's not an iPhone 5.
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.940]   It's still on-- it's got the processor it had the whole time,
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.820]   but you can actually use it as a phone now, which is nice.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.060]   It's awesome to be able to use a phone as a phone.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.500]   It was before-- you could use it before,
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.660]   but you had to practice your Buddhist breathing techniques.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.860]   You had to take a moment.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.860]   If you were the dude, you had to abide.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.420]   But now most people shouldn't have a problem.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.660]   OK.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.160]   Awesome.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.340]   It is unfortunate that it took six months to get--
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.580]   the springboard crashes, the Touch ID thing,
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.380]   six months to fix that is kind.
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.220]   That's not good.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.900]   I mean, this should-- I don't know.
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.300]   7.1 should have been out earlier,
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.780]   but things like the springboard crash,
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.900]   like the Touch ID fix, all of those things,
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.940]   I'm sad that it took Apple six months to address.
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.420]   Now that we think that the South by Southwest concerts
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.340]   had anything to do with the hurried release of 7.1.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.780]   Gruber kind of got this wrong, because he said that
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.900]   the South by Southwest iTunes Live concert would require 7.1.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.580]   It turns out it doesn't.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.060]   But it still came out on time.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.420]   This is a timeline I always heard for.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.820]   It was always an early-- at least for the last couple of months,
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.220]   it was supposed to be early March.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.420]   Why no gold master?
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.220]   I guess you don't need one, really, right?
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.300]   They've done it before.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.020]   I think there was one.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.700]   I don't know if it was 6.1 or 5.1,
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.460]   but one of them, they just dumped it without a gold master.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.260]   I always like it, because I start my review
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.100]   when the gold master comes out, because then I can assume
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.180]   nothing's going to be changing.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.220]   And then this just lands.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.900]   So now I'm halfway through my review, and it's not as fun.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.660]   That's nice.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.140]   Yeah, it's exactly the same, right?
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.460]   That's good.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.380]   We like that.
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.980]   On the other hand, it's nice to see everyone--
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.500]   everyone going through the same pain points
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.100]   at the same time, and getting that sort of poly diversity
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.500]   of reactions.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.500]   I was surprised that I thought that they were going
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.740]   to refine the interface a little bit more than they did.
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.100]   Like I said before, it really is a case of they decided
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.460]   that if you don't like some of the really big changes in 7,
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.740]   they will let you turn them off through accessibility.
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.620]   For instance, one of my pet peeves
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.580]   is that too often an important button just
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.580]   looks like a piece of text on the screen,
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.620]   because they don't want people to use button containers anymore
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.420]   if they can get away with it.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.260]   But now there's a feature so that you can essentially
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.940]   make these buttons look like hyperlinks
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.500]   by having turning on underscores, which is OK.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.220]   That's one way to go.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.580]   You can turn on button shapes too in accessibility.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.140]   You can go there and there's a button shape.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.380]   Turn on button outlines or something.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.820]   And it actually puts the shape of the hour
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.140]   around the back button again.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.300]   It's not the same as it used to be, but it's--
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.300]   Parks the interface is right.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.300]   And it'll be a shaded button.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.580]   So it looks better.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.180]   I just think that that's a--
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.380]   I mean, it's--
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:04.740]   There is--
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.220]   They are all in on this new design.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.260]   But I think Andy's right.
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260]   I think there's things that turning it off
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260]   actually creates more reliability, more recognizability,
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.860]   and a bunch of things that you really
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.660]   want in an interface.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.700]   But Apple really believes that this is the future of interface,
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.100]   that they're taking the next step.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.860]   And this is sort of like a begrudging, OK,
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.900]   you guys are taking longer to address than we thought you would.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.140]   So we'll let you turn it off.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.220]   But really, we still want to hurt you in this direction.
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.820]   Because we believe that it's right.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.380]   This is very--
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:29.900]   That's right.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.300]   I'm doing the same thing with Windows 8.1.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.300]   So look at the general text.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.940]   It's too far away to really see it.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.100]   But the general text, when I turn button shapes on,
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.980]   it puts a little button around it.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.380]   I might leave that one.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.460]   Renee is absolutely right.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.500]   Every time I've talked to somebody at Apple at every single
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.340]   level, it's not a case of, oh, we'll
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.740]   be decided to improve things a little bit.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.180]   It really is.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.820]   They really do speak with a certain fervor that says,
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.300]   this is the version of iOS we would have done from the very
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.260]   beginning had we known as much about how people interact
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.140]   with phones and tablets than as we do now.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.900]   So yeah, I mean, if there are things you don't like about iOS 7,
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.460]   deal with it.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.900]   Because they're not taking a step back,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.300]   and they're not going to do a rollback.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.780]   Like I said, I was expecting some refinements.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.580]   Because I think with every interface that Apple rolls out,
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.540]   there's always a, here's our first 20 million users,
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.940]   and we're going to get feedback from those 20 million users.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.140]   And then they start thinking, OK, that
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.260]   might have been a little bit extreme.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.180]   But now we're finding out how people are interacting
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:29.680]   with that.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.980]   So our first guess, we're going to refine that a little bit.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.460]   But yeah, it seems to be like, if you're really
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.460]   that adamant about it, we will hide a setting
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.540]   so that you can sort of adjust this if you want.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.220]   But we really do want translucency.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.100]   We really do want naked buttons.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.820]   But I think it's paying off because we
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.460]   are starting to see finally the sort of iOS 7 apps that
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.700]   were--
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.900]   that this interface was designed for.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.820]   It's not just a design language.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.780]   It really is the philosophy of try
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.020]   to get your app down to the bare bones of what its function
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.220]   is and do not put anything on the screen that doesn't directly
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.620]   relate to that function.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.340]   So we're seeing a lot of-- now we're-- over the past three
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.340]   or four weeks, I think.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.740]   I've seen a lot of apps in particular that are, wow,
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.740]   that is-- that's not just a facelift of your iOS 6 app.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.860]   You really did rethink this, like the Comixology app, which
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.820]   didn't-- was never really a great fit for iOS, I thought.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.460]   But now that they've redone it for iOS 7,
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.300]   it's a lot cleaner.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.340]   It's a lot more focused.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.300]   It's a lot more task oriented.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.780]   If you think of iOS 7, love it or go to accessibility.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.340]   Or go to Android.
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.580]   And incidentally, everybody probably should go to 7.1.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.500]   If you've already gone 7, you should go 7.1, right?
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.300]   Absolutely.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.380]   This is-- if you've been-- everything-- the only things
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.660]   that I've been warning people about iOS 6
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.180]   were the things about those re-springs, which
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.140]   were just annoying as hell.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.620]   And that was the one big drawback.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.300]   If you were holding back for any reason,
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.500]   it really is a good idea now to go to 7.1,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.900]   because even if you are using an iPhone 4, it is--
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.380]   I did manage to get one out of storage.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.140]   I now have installed it on two phones.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.060]   I've got it on the 5S.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.180]   I've got it on the 4.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.220]   I'm keeping an iPhone 5C and iOS 6
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.060]   just so I can continue to do side by side
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.700]   to remind myself of what's different.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.740]   But yeah, I don't think there's any reason not to go to 7.1,
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.700]   no matter what your previous edition is.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.420]   R's Technica has a great article by Andrew Cunningham,
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.500]   which he talks about if you have an iPhone 4,
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.340]   what's going to get better, what can't get better?
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.980]   He says, this is as good as it's going to get.
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.900]   But it is noticeably faster, still not as fast as it was
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.100]   under iOS 6.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.580]   So that might be the one-- the people who should think twice
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.020]   before jumping to 7 are probably people using an iPhone 4,
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.540]   right?
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.540]   Although it's arguable.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.780]   They won't get the security update.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.220]   So it's going to suck, but you probably
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.580]   want iOS 7 anyway, just for things like the SSL patch.
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.020]   And I'll just--
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.460]   I actually think if you've been hanging out
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.500]   first to move to 7 because of the performance issues,
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.780]   if you have an iPhone 4, this is probably the time to do it.
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.340]   Not only that, but there's a whole bunch of apps that are--
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.500]   if you-- if you-- for instance, my SlingBox, a SlingPlayer app,
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.820]   I can still use the old version on my old iPad.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.140]   But if I want the new version that
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.300]   has these really cool new features and a much improved user
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.020]   interface, I will have to upgrade that to iOS 7.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.500]   So I do think that the benefits of getting new iOS 7 apps
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.820]   are going to be way, way outweigh the speed
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.540]   you're going to get off of your iPhone 4.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.580]   Also, if you have a Ferrari, you now have CarPlay.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.420]   Yeah, I want to talk about CarPlay.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.260]   We're going to do a whole segment on CarPlay.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.700]   We'll save that for the next segment.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.460]   New Poweroff button.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.460]   Oh, very exciting.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.780]   Oh, it's pretty.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.660]   We're seeing a lot more incidents of this round.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.260]   Put your finger here because that's
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.020]   the shape of your fingertips or stuff.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.020]   Oops.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.020]   I didn't want that.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.020]   It was in production, Leo.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:47.860]   That was a production off.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.380]   Oops.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.260]   It worked, by the way.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.860]   New HDR photo mode, if you have a camera.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.780]   I do not think that I'm going to like that.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.300]   I think that's beautiful.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.700]   I think that's long overdue.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.300]   When I'm testing other cameras, it's
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.020]   a new trend next last year that's not there's enough CPU
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.180]   performance to just automatically do an HDR.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.260]   Without the user noticing it, why would you not just produce
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.460]   the best photo you can possibly make?
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.980]   And especially with the iPhone 5S, it's so fast
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.620]   that it just makes no difference.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.780]   So you may as well do it.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.660]   There is an option so that you can have it stash away
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.180]   the root images anyway.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.220]   But I think that most people who are using this feature,
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.660]   they just want that touch one button,
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.460]   get the best photo that is possible to be
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.180]   gotten by a mobile phone in the space at this time.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.220]   And I think that an auto HDR is just the perfect thing to do.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.540]   A little luya.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.380]   It's 5S only, I think, that feature, though.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.860]   OK.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.300]   I think that pretty much catches--
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.500]   Let's talk about the car.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.580]   By the way, the new Yahoo logo is also--
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.420]   Excellent.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.940]   Beautiful.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.020]   For a complete little--
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.820]   I don't think there's a whimsy.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.220]   I know this is a horrifying--
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.860]   I always think that there are no good discussion
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.540]   ever comes when there's the phrase, what would Steve Jobs
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.060]   have done.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.260]   But however, I have to think about what
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.500]   if Steve Jobs was still around and Yahoo said,
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.860]   oh, here's a new logo we'd like you to replace
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.140]   all instances of our old logo with this.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.180]   I bet there would have been some meetings.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.420]   And I bet it would have meant that, hey, guess what?
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.460]   We've rethought our logo.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.380]   We've refined it.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.060]   Steve said no.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.620]   And Steve would have been right.
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.180]   Or at least whoever Steve sent that logo to Inside Apple
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.260]   for comment would have been right.
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.940]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.820]   Ladies and gentlemen, I show today brought to you
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.980]   by our good friends at Shutterstock,
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.860]   the best place to go for high quality stock photos,
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.060]   illustrations, vectors, even video clips.
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.620]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.740]   There are now-- let me just--
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.300]   I like to go every time I go to Shutterstock and look.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.020]   Over 30 million stock images at Shutterstock.com,
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.820]   34,620,527.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.620]   This week alone, they added 238,000 new stock images.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.780]   These are royalty free stock images.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.100]   Don't forget when you visit Shutterstock.com.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.860]   At the very top there, there's a footage tab, which
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.020]   will show you video footage as well.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.820]   And a lot of the footage is really great because it's
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.300]   got alpha channels in it, so we use it to superimpose stuff
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.540]   like cats on Sarah Lane's show.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.900]   Really a lovely place to get the stuff you need for your website,
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.140]   your publication.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.140]   I use these all the time.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.060]   I use stock photos just all the time.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.580]   We use Shutterstock all the time because we have a 25-minute
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.060]   today subscription, which is a great deal, by the way.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.220]   And that means in our blog post and everything,
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.140]   we always use Shutterstock stuff.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.100]   There are, as many as more than 20,000 new images every day,
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.260]   individually curated for content and quality.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.780]   They do have image packs, but the subscriptions are great
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.620]   if you do-- if you're a publication,
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.900]   and you do a lot of stuff.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.100]   And I think the thing that really makes Shutterstock stand out
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:56.820]   is their search.
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:00.460]   You can enter in nouns like cats.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.660]   And of course, there you have cats.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:07.100]   Kitty, get off of the Shutterstock.
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.100]   He's just floating there.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:08.940]   Where can he?
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.900]   Kitty.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.020]   But I can also search for angry cats.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.780]   So you can add adjectives to your--
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.580]   Now, I encourage you to sign up when you do this because it's
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:20.860]   free.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.180]   You don't have to give them a credit card.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.460]   And when you do have an account,
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.780]   you'll be able to get some free images every week,
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.740]   a free photo and a free vector image.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.140]   Yours for the taking, no watermark or anything.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.140]   And you can use the light boxes, which is a great way to take
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.460]   images-- you don't have to buy them.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.540]   Just take the images and put them into your light box
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.940]   so that you have them for later use
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.580]   or to share them with friends.
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.500]   Ah, angry cat.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:43.980]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.100]   We shouldn't leave you with that.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.060]   How about happy cats?
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.260]   Let's see what happy cats.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.540]   Hi, I'm a happy cat.
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.580]   Not a grumpy cat.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.220]   I'm a happy cat.
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.220]   You can see that when you search through Shutterstock,
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.860]   you get great inspiration for ideas.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:06.860]   It's like a lubrication for your brain.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.740]   Also, a great iPad app, Webby Award winning iPad app,
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.180]   which contains great shared light boxes and things.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.860]   This is an example of some of these examples.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.300]   I used to try to do a lot of these myself.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.580]   Because I used to do a lot of these.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.380]   Yeah, you're a Photoshop guy.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.300]   And you think, oh, I could do my own illustration
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.340]   of the cuts of bees.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.060]   Then I did the math.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.980]   I was like, it was like my hourly or even some of the works
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.700]   of the company and how long it's going to take them
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.860]   and then how--
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.820]   and then it'll be done sometime next week instead of right now.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.860]   You know what I like about this is it looks like it's chalk
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.420]   on a chalkboard.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.860]   And then they have them that are not.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.660]   And this is a vector image, by the way,
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.780]   which means you could scale it completely.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.300]   This would be so great for a restaurant, maybe
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.500]   print it big on the wall.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.260]   Here's the deal.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.300]   Go to Shutterstock.com.

[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.340]   Start playing with the light boxes.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.580]   When you decide to purchase either an image package
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.620]   or a subscription, you'll get 20% off when you use our offer

[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.460]   You know, great for magazines.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.460]   If you need--
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.460]   Huh?
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.460]   Ah!
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.460]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.460]   Ah!
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.460]   Ah!
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.460]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.460]   Giant cat.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.820]   You see the Shutterstock watermark?
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.180]   You know, we can actually buy those.
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:31.260]   You don't have to steal them.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.740]   That cat can really go places.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.940]   That is a giant cat.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.620]   Brian loves the cats.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.060]   Oh, the cats love the keys.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.020]   Careful, Andy.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.060]   He's going to attack you.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.060]   So that is the biggest feature in some ways,
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.460]   is, as you mentioned, Rene Richie Carplay,
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.380]   except that does anybody have Carplay?
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.580]   My Ferrari review unit hasn't arrived yet.
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.100]   Where's my darn it?
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.900]   Where's my Ferrari review unit?
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.620]   We should really get to review that.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.420]   Just for assuming--
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.420]   For the carplay.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.260]   For the carplay.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.180]   It's not for the--
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.940]   you know, horsepower.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.700]   I guess if I go to the Apple site,
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.460]   they have some images of--
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.540]   The amazing thing is the diversity of control
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.460]   that Apple's allowed.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.780]   I mean, I don't want to say unprecedented,
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.220]   but they're letting this run on no touch screens
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.500]   with knobs and buttons, on resistive touch screens.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.980]   So if you don't want to take off your matching Ferrari leather
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.660]   gloves, you can still use it on capacitive touch screens
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.940]   with Siri without Siri.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.540]   Also, we're looking at when this feature was first announced
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.420]   last year, I was talking to different car makers,
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.220]   or people I know that work for different car companies.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.580]   And that this really is a very, very egalitarian sort
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.300]   of feature.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.380]   We're used to seeing a keynote announcement.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.420]   And now for cars that are costing us
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.380]   little as $68,000, we're offering native iPod support.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.660]   No, I mean, they're even like budget forwards
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.660]   that will integrate this way.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.300]   Now, do they-- they're not specifying--
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.740]   I know for instance, you can have buttons,
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.100]   you can have touch.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.260]   They're not specifying--
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.140]   how are they determining what the form factor is?
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.060]   It looks like they're being really, really open.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.620]   It's flexible.
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.500]   It's like the reflection of the car industry.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.540]   And all of this is running on the rim software, right?
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.700]   I mean, almost all these QNX don't call it the rim software.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.060]   Because that's-- it implies that BlackBerry really
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:12.900]   had anything to do with it.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.980]   They bought QNX.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.260]   But they still--
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.740]   They own it.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.820]   They have a future somewhere.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.380]   They own it.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.740]   And Dodge's company.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.780]   They're amazing.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.500]   And it looks like the current implementations of car
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.820]   play are running on top of QNX.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.460]   But theoretically, you can run on top of embedded Android,
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.700]   embedded Linux, embedded Microsoft.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.860]   If they make the deals.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.780]   But QNX was the fastest way.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.780]   It's very similar to Apple TV in that it's a form of AirPlay,
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.180]   but it's bidirectional.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.500]   But there's no Apple TV box.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.060]   So there has to be some layer that handles the receipt.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.380]   And because there's no separate box,
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.820]   it has to be built into the infotainment system.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.660]   And QNX is an incredibly mature car technology.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.160]   Exactly.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.300]   And they've been very fast at deploying the hooks
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.140]   that that system needs to communicate.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.620]   My car already has QNX.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.820]   I would be very interested if there
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.300]   were a way to upgrade it to do car play.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.940]   Mercedes said they might--
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.100]   Mercedes is going to offer an awesome--
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.180]   I mean, do we think that all the graphic interfaces that
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.540]   have been being built for these cars are slowly just
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.900]   going to go away and just be Android and iOS hooks?
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.060]   I don't think so, because I think the need in a car
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.740]   is very different from the need on a device
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.780]   you're holding in your hand.
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.900]   Well, for one thing, the issue of distracted driving is huge.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.700]   Well, I understand.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.660]   But I just think that as an owner of a lot of cars--
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.500]   I mean, I have a car with a big screen on it.
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.300]   And I just want this there.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   I don't want to--
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.100]   No, you just want them to--
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.300]   No, no, but I'm saying.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.700]   But what I mean by that is the map,
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.060]   I don't care if it's Apple Maps or Google Maps.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.060]   Well, it is Apple Maps.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.060]   I just don't want to--
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.980]   If there's one negative point, you're using Apple Maps.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.980]   Now, I think Apple Maps are fine today,
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.740]   but I don't know if the world thinks that.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.420]   It's different, though, Leo, because a lot of people
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.700]   who have BMWs, Mercedes, they're only optioning
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.060]   are out of date maps that they then
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.860]   have to go pay $200 and get an SD card and load it up
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.940]   and go and update it.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.940]   Whereas these are going to be updated as often as Apple
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.540]   updates the back end on your iPhone.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.540]   I mean, I just think--
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.400]   So it's getting it from the iPhone?
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.720]   But also, you're talking about, certainly,
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.440]   one of the most popular consumer, real consumer
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.880]   products that are out there.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.720]   This is-- you talk about the reach of the smartphone market
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.920]   and you realize exactly how small it is
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.320]   compared to the population at large.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.720]   How many people out there actually have cars?
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.200]   That's almost 100%.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.680]   That is a very, very much higher percentage.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.400]   And now you're reaching people who absolutely do not
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.700]   care about any interface or any feature that can't be operated
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.680]   by pushing a labeled button and pushing it
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.280]   into the on position and not then having to go to iMore
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.240]   to get a video to figure out whether the air conditioning is
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:37.740]   on or off.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.120]   But actually see that, OK, this is a red light that
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   says that the air conditioning is on.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.440]   I think you talk-- you talk--
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.520]   that is playing--
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.880]   designing the interior of a car, it really is user interface
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.480]   design playing at expert level.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.840]   Nobody at Apple, I think, has ever played the game
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.520]   at that level, because only because you just have to--
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.480]   it's just such a simple, simple thing
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.400]   without-- nobody cares about the design.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.760]   All they care about is that this thing
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.280]   does what it's supposed to do the way that it thinks
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.560]   the person thinks is going to happen.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.960]   I guess for me, I think for a car company trying to shave
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.600]   a percentage point here and there of sales,
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   I do think that this integration--
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.440]   I know that for me, when I buy my next car,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.120]   one of my top three, if not my number one thing,
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.480]   is how are my phones going to integrate with the car?
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.520]   Like, I don't care about it.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.880]   The other issue is--
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.800]   You know, like, I don't care about the gas mileage.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.160]   I don't care about--
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.320]   that's another really fine point here.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.440]   I have a Mac.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.240]   There's almost 100% certainty that the next time I need a computer,
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.400]   it's going to be a Mac.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.200]   Almost 100% brand loyalty.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.280]   Even with the phones, I have nearly 100% brand loyalty.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.600]   It's really hard to shift me.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.040]   Cars, most people-- here's the amount of money that I have.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.160]   It has to fit three kids.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.040]   It has to be able to occasionally transport a surfboard.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.040]   And there are nine cars that fit that function
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.240]   I will buy any make that is highly recommended.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.480]   So when you get people who are really kind of equally
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.200]   balanced between three or four different models,
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.000]   if this one has a really intimate connection to my phone
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.840]   that other one does not, that's a big, big, important
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.760]   get for that car.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   On the other hand, as an Android user,
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.720]   I'm left out in the cold because you have to have a 5S or 5C.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.960]   That's not entirely true.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.160]   It's like three models for this.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.440]   So one is you just get in the car
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.400]   and you use the built-in Q and X system,
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.200]   which can understand your Android phone,
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.680]   and just gives you whatever the default experience is.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.360]   That's one of the reasons why CarPlay exists
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.600]   because Apple's not going to make the complete stack
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.480]   for a car entertainment system because,
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.600]   A, the car companies wouldn't let it be exclusive to iPhone.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.440]   And B, Apple would never make it work with Android,
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.080]   Blackberry, Windows phone.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.400]   So all of this is the fancy way.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.760]   The question is how good would the fallback be?
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.920]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.920]   CarPlay is Apple's way of connecting to your car.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.960]   And there's nothing to stop Google
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.760]   from making Android's way or Microsoft
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.920]   to make Windows phones way.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.880]   It's just Apple's good at pushing this kind of thing
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.560]   to market.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.520]   They've got all the manufacturers, Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai,
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:56.200]   Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo will do it this year, 2014 models,
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.680]   and then pretty much everybody,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.680]   including Ford, Chevy, Land Rover, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi,
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.560]   will do it in years to come.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.840]   Well, in this model works great for the car companies
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.160]   because it means that they're basically Switzerland.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.640]   I mean, they don't.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.800]   In the end they don't care.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.640]   Well, they have another advantage,
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.400]   which is they're getting an A7 chip,
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.960]   whereas cars are just, the computers and cars
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:18.960]   are very powerful.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.920]   So you said you got it from the car maker's point of view.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.720]   They used to use iPod Connect,
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.280]   and you would connect your iPod cable to the USB,
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.520]   and that was powered by Q and X subsystems as well.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.480]   So for them, this is just the next generation
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.920]   of Apple's car integration that they've been servicing
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.480]   for years.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.160]   Puts more of the interface on the screen.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.520]   It also gives them for companies
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.800]   that don't have voice activation, instant Siri,
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.320]   which is a big deal, I think.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.520]   I mean, I think that users want to talk to their system.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.560]   Well, and I think there's a lot of opportunities.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.800]   Once you start tying these together,
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.840]   there's a lot of opportunities for the geeks,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.000]   so to speak, to get a lot more out of their car.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.200]   Like, for instance, I mean, in that interaction,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.600]   I mean, it depends on what the car companies want to provide you,
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   but you go to CES, you'll see these car companies interfaces
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.240]   that tell you all about your engine and everything else.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.600]   There's no reason why that eventually couldn't be exposed.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.600]   You don't like to do that because they like
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.040]   to make a very bright dividing line between the entertainment
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.840]   system and the systems that control the wheels.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.160]   So the real fear is hacking and so forth.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.040]   So very often, these telematic systems
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.400]   are completely separated from one another because--
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.880]   You can get accessories that let you tie into your car.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.160]   Yeah, you can affect what data I know.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.880]   I mean, you need to do that to get the connector.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.960]   But putting it on your screen, that might be something they
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.120]   don't-- I'm not sure they want it.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.960]   Not only that, but somewhere in my inbox,
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.840]   there's a press release for it.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.600]   Just a simple like Siri Bluetooth button
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.520]   that does nothing more than engage Siri.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.080]   You put it whatever you want.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.880]   And so long as your phone is already
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.560]   connected to your Bluetooth system,
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.600]   it'll pick up the speakers and you've got pretty much
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.760]   whatever you want.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.080]   I'm glad to see this kind of outreach and problem
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.440]   solving because, of course, there
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.320]   are people who don't have a center console entertainment
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.240]   system.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.840]   I'm a proud owner of a high mileage car
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   because, again, high mileage and it's running perfectly.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.920]   Great, let's keep with it.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.800]   But it's nice to have ways to integrate new technology
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.080]   into older fleet vehicles like that.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.680]   I was thinking about it today, listening
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.160]   to some of the distraction because they're
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.240]   talking about banning Google Glass in some states.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.520]   So if you want distracted driving,
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.860]   I realized part of what Google, I think,
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.600]   was thinking about when they thought about the driverless
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.120]   cars is people will get distracted, distracted, distracted,
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.160]   and then they won't need to look at it at all.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.320]   They want them to be distracted.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.840]   Well, no, no, no, it was like, you'll be distracted,
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.560]   distracted, and then you'll just have a driver--
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.160]   the car will drive for you and you can go back to being
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:33.600]   distracted.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.440]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.480]   One thing I found interesting is Seth
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.960]   Weintrault's 9 to 5 Mac pointed out
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.240]   that he would much rather-- if you have a Toyota,
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.560]   you'd love to have iOS in the car.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.840]   But if you have a Tesla with that 17-inch screen,
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.880]   you probably don't want to overwrite that with iOS in the car
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.240]   because there's nowhere near feature parity yet.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.960]   Well, and first of all--
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.680]   I have in my car, I have Google Earth on the maps.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.720]   I see satellite.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.600]   I have Street View.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.240]   I press a button.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.160]   I can see the Street View of--
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.240]   I don't want to lose that.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.360]   So it is a good--
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.560]   I mean, that-- and B, you can't require people
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.440]   to have an iPhone, and that just doesn't make any sense.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.680]   So you've got to have a fallback.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.240]   I would love to see car makers be a little more
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.080]   platform agnostic and say, whatever you bring in the car,
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.280]   we're going to interface well with it.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.840]   Android in the car was announced at CES.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.720]   I'm sure that's coming.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.840]   Yeah, Audi's doing that.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.520]   That's definitely an interesting topic
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.960]   because what constitutes a sophisticated operating
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.000]   system and a sophisticated user interface
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.720]   for inside the car, if you look at the way that a dashboard has
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.960]   been set up so that every device that requires user
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.400]   management while they're driving, it
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.480]   is a big stiff button with really good clear labels on it.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.680]   And it's as close to the steering wheel as possible,
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.320]   but not so close a way that its view might be obstructed
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.280]   by the ring of the wheel itself.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.880]   It's possible that a user interface for a car
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.520]   is such a different set of requirements
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.600]   to deliver the most amount of features
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.480]   with the minimal amount of attention
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.520]   that even iOS in the car is not going to be adequate.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.320]   We're going to need somebody who creates something that
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.800]   is just-- remember the user interface
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:10.760]   of the Star Fleet, the US Enterprise computer,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.880]   when there is a crisis.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.120]   It clears every single screen of any useful information.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.480]   It just tells you red alert.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.160]   Say, well, why don't you tell me what the red alert is?
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.200]   No, red alert, red alert, red alert.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.440]   Maybe that's sort of like going to be the aesthetic
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.400]   of a good car interface, where it doesn't try to give you
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.200]   even more than three buttons at one time.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.280]   It simply tries to tell you, hi, this is your map.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.760]   I'm not even going to tell you things
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.720]   that you don't care about as opposed to here is your car,
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.320]   here is where you need to go next, and go to hell
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.480]   if you want anything else for me.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.920]   I can't tell you, there's such a gulf
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.760]   between what cars do today.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.320]   They are the worst interfaces.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.080]   There's not one car that has maybe the Tesla that I don't know.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.680]   But it seems to me a 17-inch screen
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.920]   is not a good idea in your car.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.680]   But it's good in the sense that you replace a whole bunch
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.320]   of really redundant dials and gauges with one panel.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.640]   So the top half of it is going to be your map,
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.200]   but your bottom half is going to be whatever type
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.480]   of driving you're doing right now.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.640]   Here's the one where you touch the button for climate controls.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.720]   If you're pulled over, you're more in-depth controls.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:16.360]   But yeah, I mean, every time I take a look at new cars,
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.920]   I look at the center console interface,
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.240]   and I think this is absolutely not in any way an improvement.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.120]   I mean, it's much, much worse than simply the phone
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.880]   that I have inside a really nice dock on my old car.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.080]   Why would I, it would be a downgrade to trade in
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.040]   my very, very stable high mileage car
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.440]   for something brand new with a crappy,
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.440]   crappy center console computer?
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.960]   It made me think of the iOS 6 version
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.600]   of what CarPlay would look like.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.080]   The thing about the distracted driving element, though,
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.520]   is I remember back in high school,
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.040]   my friends would always be fussing with the tape deck
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.600]   or the radio knobs and not looking
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.560]   where they were driving.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.000]   I commuted to work for about 10 years,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.640]   and people would read newspapers or novels
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.840]   on their steering wheel.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.680]   Have you ever been to--
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.520]   You argue with people--
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.360]   Here you got the cabin Brazil.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   Make up.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.200]   The cabin Brazil has a little DVD player.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.680]   They're like, you know--
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   I'm a kid, you know, I'm a DVD player.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.680]   The cabin Brazil.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   What's that?
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   A cab.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.680]   Oh, a cab in Brazil.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.600]   You get a cab in Brazil, and they're like watching DVD's
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   while they're driving.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.760]   Yeah, well, that's encouraging.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.760]   There's a lot of traffic.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.760]   There's a lot of--
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.520]   There's a lot of time in Brazil,
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.760]   but you're not really going anywhere.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.120]   So, geez.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:27.760]   All right, finally, Apple credits the Evader's Jailbreak team
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.840]   with--
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.200]   Thank you, AJA breakers, for helping us
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:37.000]   find the problems in 7.0 so that we could fix them in 7.1.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.400]   RoboI-99, as well as corporate security specialists
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.920]   from Google and FireEye have been credited for finding
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:49.160]   vulnerabilities in 7.1 Apple fixed security issues with.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.720]   Get ready for the list.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.560]   Back up, certificate trust, configuration,
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.200]   profile score, capture crash reporting,
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.040]   DYLD, FaceTime image, I/O, I/O, get HID event.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.360]   iTunes store, kernel office, fewer.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.520]   These are all security issues.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.120]   Photos back and profile Safari settings, springboard,
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.800]   springboard lock screen, the telephony, UI framework, USB
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.040]   host, video driver, and web kit.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.320]   So, Apple has fixed everything.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.280]   There are no more bugs.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.920]   You can safely use your iPhone.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.560]   Thank you very much.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.440]   And by the way, you can't jailbreak someone
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.640]   because they fixed all the holes that they used.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.120]   Did jailbreak it?
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:25.880]   Let's take a break.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.640]   Come back with more.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.440]   There's lots more Mac news, including
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.280]   is was it a win for Apple in court?
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.240]   They didn't get a permanent ban of Samsung products anyway.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.400]   We'll find out if it was a win, a loss, or a tie.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.440]   And we're with the A8.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.880]   And Shaquille O'Neal, his budget for apps might amaze you.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:56.160]   It approaches mine.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.200]   But first a word from LegalZoom.com.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   LegalZoom's not a law firm.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.400]   No, don't don't you think that?
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.560]   It's better than a law firm.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.360]   LegalZoom provides self-help services
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   at your specific direction so you can, in affordable ways,
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.000]   get the things done you need to.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.920]   If you're starting a business-- this is--
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.040]   March is National Start Your Business Month.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.800]   If you're starting a business, you ought to do what I did.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.840]   I asked Kevin Rose.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.960]   I wanted to start Twit, this thing called Twit.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.600]   It's crazy.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.320]   And I asked Kevin, what do I-- because he'd
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.200]   started a lot of companies.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:24.960]   He was doing Dig.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.080]   This was in 2005.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.520]   He said, well, you got to get the LLC.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.200]   He pointed me to legalzoom.com.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.640]   $99.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.480]   I didn't need a white shoe law firm, just $99.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.480]   Or chapter S or chapter C, also $99.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.040]   That did trademark the Twit logo and the Twit name.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.680]   That was $169.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.440]   We're still running on the operating agreement
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.480]   that we got in 2005.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   Really?
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.800]   Yeah, I haven't-- even though we now
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.200]   do have a white shoe law firm.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.480]   He wears white shoes to meetings.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.680]   It drives me crazy.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.800]   He looks like Elvis.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.840]   Well, he's having very good love.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.400]   You should ask him to sing.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   He says, how you doing?
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.480]   How's that loss you're going?
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.000]   If you haven't got a will, you need a will.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Your last will in Testament.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.520]   Personalized legal document specific to your state.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.760]   And if it does come up-- for instance, one of the questions
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.160]   I had was LLC, chapter S, which-- what is the difference?
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.400]   You can get help from an attorney.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.920]   They've pre-negotiated flat rates.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.880]   With attorneys in your state, you
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.600]   could choose the attorney based on not only their profile,
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.280]   but unedited reviews from legal Zoom users.

[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.080]   I love this because they really empower companies.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.680]   They empower people to start their own business.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:39.680]   Are you an LLC?
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.400]   Are you a corp?
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.240]   What are you?
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.640]   C corp.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.520]   We're actually now thinking about maybe,
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.840]   should we be an LLC?
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.280]   I'd be a C corp.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.320]   I think for me, it was really--
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.000]   I have to admit it.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.920]   I don't think it was--
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.480]   I don't know if it was the best business decision.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.600]   But for me, it's all double-tax and all this stuff.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.280]   But for me, mentally, I just really
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.280]   had to feel like the company was separate for me.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.040]   No, I didn't want to feel like it was attached to me.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.760]   I like to feel like it's an entity, and I'm an entity.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.200]   Because the way an LLC works mentally,
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.800]   it's passed through taxation.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.200]   It's all-- it's your tax return, which is a little scary.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.360]   Yeah, for me, I just decided I'd rather--
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.280]   And I guess when we started early, they were like, well,
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   eventually you're going to scale to a point where you just
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.400]   want to be a C corp and sort of--
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.040]   We're kind of looking at that.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:18.880]   I just figured I'd just start there.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.840]   It's expensive, though.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.320]   It is.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.800]   It was.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.680]   We're-- yeah.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   When your tax bill gets into seven figures,
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.280]   that's when you really start feeling like--
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.880]   Yes.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.520]   Yes.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.240]   Moving along, what else happened in the world of Apple?
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.120]   What is the story with the Samsung thing?
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.280]   We had actually a good interview with Florian Miller
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.240]   of "Foss Patents" this morning on TNT.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.800]   I encourage you to watch it because this guy knows everything.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:52.160]   Apple wanted to ban 23 Samsung smartphones and tablets.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.280]   The judge said, well, it's an awful lot.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.440]   So I guess you could say they lost the latest round
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.960]   with Samsung.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.800]   But--
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   But--
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.680]   $290 million down the drain.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.360]   That's the jury award and Judge Ko at the same time upheld
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.240]   that award.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.640]   Samsung said, oh, it should be more like, I don't know, $52 million.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   $3 or $50.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:25.600]   So it's a total now of $1.05 billion in additional $930 million.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.720]   That's still really cheap for all the R&D Samsung got out of it.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.480]   Now, so yeah.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.400]   OK, so was-- the original judgment was $1.05 billion.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.800]   They have to pay $930 million.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.200]   So they got--
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   You know, they got a deal.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.160]   And a pretty perspective.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.160]   I mean, that sounds like a really big number.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.320]   But Apple spends a lot more with Samsung
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:48.600]   on the chip production for iPhones than that judgment.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.880]   So Apple could appeal this decision,
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.800]   but Mueller pointed out that if they do,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.440]   that opens it all up again.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.640]   And Samsung could appeal everything.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.080]   Right.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:04.360]   So it might be that's Apple just say, OK, when some you lose some.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.320]   Apple has so much money that I think they're
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.120]   getting to label what Samsung did as copying them
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.960]   and pointing to the fact that Samsung got legally
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.640]   reprimanded for it is worth a lot more than a couple more
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.400]   billion in there.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.120]   That's all they were doing.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.600]   Enormous cash.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:22.240]   Hey, let me ask you about this Rene Richie,
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.320]   because you're an expert on rumors and so forth.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.680]   Apple, in the recent beta of OS 10 Mavericks, 10.9.3,
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.720]   the next one out, according to 9 to 5 Mac,
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:38.120]   there is now support for external retina displays.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.960]   That pixel-double resolution that they do on MacBook Pros
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.640]   with retina.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.520]   Is that what you're seeing as well?
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.760]   So and this is where it's so hard for me.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.120]   And maybe you guys can give me some advice,
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.640]   because as soon as the beta launched,
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.080]   we have a machine running for 4K displays, sorry,
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.120]   3 4K displays, and we tested it.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.480]   But we didn't publish anything because it's NDA software.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.320]   But then, you know, all these publications,
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.120]   a Nantec did a deep dive on it.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.200]   And a Nantec, you know, it's pretty mainstream now.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.440]   They go to Apple events.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:04.960]   Right.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.120]   I don't know what we're allowed to say
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.080]   and what we're not allowed to say anymore.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.560]   But all the reports so far have been incredibly accurate
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.280]   given, you know, what we've tested.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.480]   So that's tricky, isn't it?
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:18.720]   Because you're required under NDA not to say anything.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.000]   I haven't downloaded this version.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.560]   I've just, we've had people download it and test it out.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.640]   So I'm kind of NDA by, like, 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.120]   I don't blame you for being confused by this,
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.960]   because it gives the bat, you know,
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.680]   you're outspoken, Andy, on people
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.880]   who should not violate their NDA's.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.760]   Only, not because I think that Apple needs
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   to be defended from bullies.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.720]   But that if you know, if you read an agreement
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.840]   and you agreed to do something,
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.840]   you should do that thing that you agreed to do.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.120]   And you shouldn't pretend that you can't do your job
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.680]   unless you remember the developer program,
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.880]   or you can't do your job unless you're reporting
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.360]   on something that you're under NDA for.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.160]   Because, again, when I, when I, when I,
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.640]   when I agree to an NDA to get an advanced look at something,
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.360]   so I can get something out there early,
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.600]   you're always just, you're, it's also a personal thing
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.280]   because I'm always, I know that I can publish at Wednesday
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.240]   at 9 p.m.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.240]   So I'll have my copy ready, like Wednesday afternoon to file,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.840]   but somewhere in the back of my mind, I'm thinking,
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.320]   oh, if there's a way I can finish this
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.960]   and have it in my editor's hands Tuesday morning,
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.760]   because somebody is gonna just,
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.360]   maybe somebody's gonna decide to get a jump
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.080]   on everybody else and be first to get their piece out.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.240]   But again, it really is, if you,
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.800]   if someone asks you a question saying that,
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.120]   I will give you this information.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.320]   If you promise me, you're not gonna tell anybody,
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.120]   until X date, and you say, you can trust me.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.040]   I won't tell a darn soul.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.960]   That means, okay, that's, that's, that wasn't,
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.880]   that was pretty explicit.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.560]   That was pretty easy to agree to,
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.200]   just do what you said you would do, that's all.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.640]   - And I know some sites get around it
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.240]   by just linking to the people who break the NDA,
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.920]   but then you're giving attention to them anyway,
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.640]   and you're just sort of wink, wink, nudge, nudging it.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.080]   - Yeah. - And yeah, it's--
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.480]   - And also just, I'm sorry, just to put a cap on it.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.800]   I don't see why anybody thinks
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.040]   that that's in their best interest.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.080]   Because you will, yes, you will get ahead on people
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.960]   on this one time, but again, unless you,
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.840]   if you think that you can do service to your readers
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.200]   by occasionally getting stuff under NDA,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   then you'll be doing that service to your readers.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.240]   You will have a relationship that you can then,
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.200]   that will then pay off in the future.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.080]   But if you burn this person who trusted you,
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.760]   not only are you cutting yourself off
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   from future information that will be of use to your readers,
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.920]   but also realize that there's probably somebody
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.400]   at that company who have the choice of putting your name
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.760]   on this list or not putting your name on this list.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.120]   And now this person has to tell their boss,
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.840]   yeah, you know that person I told it,
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.480]   I assist it to you that we could all trust,
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.960]   yeah, we couldn't trust them.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.760]   Sorry about that, boss.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.840]   That's what really gets me.
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.520]   - Yeah, but then I feel like I don't have enough,
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.160]   I have my obligation is not to apple,
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.880]   my obligation is to my audience,
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.040]   but the way I saw that is by not doing NDA's
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.120]   and that one time I did in the last 10 years,
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.800]   I deeply regretted it.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.200]   - That's exactly correct.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.320]   You have to simply make that choice,
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.120]   but I'm going to get the information,
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   but not do what I agreed to do
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.920]   is just not an option that's available to you.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.320]   - Yeah, 'cause you're violating your word,
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.560]   I mean, it's simply a matter of honor.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.080]   - In this case, Peter Cohen did write it up for us,
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.320]   he did not download it, he's not under NDA for I/O
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.160]   for 10.9.3, he just did it based on the information
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.600]   going around in the context of Apple's 4K plans moving forward,
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.840]   but it looks like Apple will be doing it.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.160]   What we all expected them to do,
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.280]   which is to treat 4K displays sort of like retina displays.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.080]   And do the scaling thing so that they look,
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.240]   from whatever they look fairly spectacular now.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.280]   - And I would, I mean, look, I don't sign NDA's,
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:43.280]   I think that we have the right to know this NDA'd information.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.760]   We have a need to know this,
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.760]   'cause it's a consumer of consumer value.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.640]   If you're considering buying a 4K display,
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.240]   to know ahead of time that Apple is,
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.720]   you know, is going to be doing this is very valuable.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.000]   This is consumer information.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.960]   So I think I would defend the right of the press
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.600]   to dig as deep as they possibly can into this stuff.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.440]   And if somebody breaks their NDA and reports something,
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.560]   I'm going to repeat it,
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.200]   because I think there's a right to know,
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.000]   there's an important right to know on the part of the user.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.840]   - Right? - If the downside then
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.000]   is if Apple doesn't ship it,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.480]   people get disappointed because they know that it hasn't been there.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.080]   - So you have to say, and I think we're pretty good about this,
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.720]   hey, look, this is in the code,
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.120]   this doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.080]   I don't report on Apple patents for that reason,
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.040]   because patents, who knows what that means.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.440]   - I like to start rumors myself.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.000]   - You're bad, you're bad, you're bad.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.400]   - But the patents are usually what Apple's not doing,
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.560]   and they put up from 100 of them
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.400]   so they can hide what they are.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.240]   But I think when you go and you do in 10.9.3,
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:42.080]   you put in code that does pixel doubling on 4K displays,
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.880]   that sounds like pretty clearly
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.160]   that's how Apple's going to handle 4K displays.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.560]   It makes sense.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.400]   - Right. - Yeah, it's--
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.320]   - Does it imply that Apple might be working on 4K displays?
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.760]   Not necessarily, right?
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.400]   - It does help the 4K displays that are already out there, right?
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.840]   So it does that more effectively.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.640]   - And the 60 Hertz, apparently, is also much welcome.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.160]   - Well, and the 60 Hertz requires the Thunderbolt
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.000]   to connectors, connections.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.320]   - Yes.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.000]   - And the, I still think that the thing
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.720]   that I'm interested in is to see if, as a hobby, of course,
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.680]   they, that Apple, things of just putting the Apple TV
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.880]   into the monitor so that you can watch TV,
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.680]   you know, when you're not using your computer.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.520]   - Yeah.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.360]   - It got front row out.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.080]   - See, I would love Apple TV built into a large-sized Mac.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.240]   It's like a 27-inch iMac.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.720]   Why don't you just build the Apple TV software
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.080]   into all of those things? - Exactly.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.560]   - My Mac should, my MacBook Pro should have it.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.720]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.640]   That's all I'm saying. - It's a front row.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.160]   - It'd be a great way to see how people interact, you know,
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.760]   with TV.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:44.160]   - Along that lines, I got a call yesterday from the,
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.400]   from Apple's, what did he call himself?
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.840]   Apple's executive offices.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.840]   I got scared.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.160]   (laughing)
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.800]   - He's in trouble again.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   - I got scared. - That's amazing.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.880]   - I thought, oh crap, what have I done?
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.840]   And then it was simply, oh, we just wanna make sure
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.680]   that that Mac Pro thing has been figured out
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   and you got your RAM and all of that stuff, so.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.840]   - Nice.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.680]   - Somebody's listening.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.560]   - I don't wanna talk to anybody in Cupertino ever, ever.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.480]   I just feel like they're gonna spank me.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.400]   - John, a lot of them are very nice people.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.720]   - They were very nice. - They care about you.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.880]   - They care about you. - Well, you know,
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.200]   I kind of, this is the other thing I resent a little bit.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.720]   It wasn't until they figured out
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.360]   it was me that they cared.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.280]   There's a picture of you now.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.600]   You know, like in presidents and other countries,
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.760]   a picture of Leo now on all the tech support is going.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.120]   - It wasn't, it wasn't until somebody called and said,
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.560]   oh, and I'm a big fan of yours
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.920]   that I started getting nice treatment.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.520]   You know what I'm saying? - Right.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.520]   - Before that, it was, bring it back to the store.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.120]   We'll see if it's really broken
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.400]   and then maybe we'll order a part
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.600]   and you might get it in a month or two.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.440]   And then all of a sudden, here's the part.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.920]   Whoa, but it's even a new.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.880]   You know, so I resent that a little bit.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.440]   - That's funny, but it's pretty gone to the radar.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.640]   - But obviously Apple does not use Radian 6.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.320]   So that's the. - What's that?
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.040]   - So you can always tell companies that use Radian 6.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:04.040]   So United, FedEx, a couple other companies use Radian 6.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.720]   And what Radian 6 does is it allows people
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.080]   in your organization to know when you're tweeting
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.760]   anything else, they can see it, but they also understand
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.840]   like how prominent you are.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.760]   They know everything about you when you call.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.160]   So when you call, they put your name in
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.600]   and they know exactly who you are.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.080]   They know that you have X number of followers.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.560]   They know and it ranks you based on the,
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.120]   it's kind of like a cloud score, except it's not cloud.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   It's their own little magic.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.520]   - They have like Twitter users you have.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:34.640]   - Yeah, but it also just, a lot of these companies
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.160]   are using a lot of these tools to know an enormous amount.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.240]   You know, this gets into that whole data,
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.640]   you know, where it's coming is that you call
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.040]   as you call an organization there.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.880]   - I always take that from their point of view,
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:44.560]   but I wish they would treat everybody
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.520]   as if they had a half a million Twitter followers.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.640]   - Oh no, but I think that a lot of times
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.480]   it's not just that you have a lot of Twitter followers.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.560]   It's also knowing a lot about just what you need.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.600]   I mean, you know, they'll--
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:55.440]   - Well, that's good.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.800]   - I don't mind that.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.000]   That's what a lot of companies are trying to do.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.560]   I mean, it's trying to get everyone.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.680]   - The executive relations is who is a guy
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.840]   from corporate executive relations called me.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.920]   And he said, "And from now on, do me a favor.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.800]   If you have N need trouble, just call me."
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.640]   - Right.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.640]   - They don't want me to tweet.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.480]   - Yeah.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.320]   - They don't want you to tweet.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.160]   They don't want you to talk about it on Mac or anything.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.120]   - Whatever you do, don't talk about it on Mac or anything.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.280]   - Double, quarterly, or if they decide
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.760]   what they didn't like, you maybe they would have just called
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.600]   and hung up.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.920]   (laughing)
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.760]   - That's why I keep finding--
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.880]   - Yeah, I get a door to place a module right here.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.880]   And you got your ear close to the phone.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.120]   Okay, now this is me smashing it with a little hammer
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.760]   instead of giving it to you, Leo.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.200]   - We know you, Leo, LaPor.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.040]   - It just bugs me.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.160]   I just feel like they should just, you know, anyway.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.000]   - I don't know.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.160]   - I mean, I bought a module, I just want to,
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.000]   I'm going to give you both the official Apple.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.360]   The only difference in the Apple module
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.600]   and the one I bought from other world computing
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.280]   is it's, the Apple one is painted black on the side.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.400]   So I'm going to give you the Mac Pro again now.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.600]   But on one condition, you could do all the stuff
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.680]   you want to do with it.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.080]   But would you just look at the difference
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.240]   in the other world computing module
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.280]   and the Apple module, see if there's any
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.120]   different-- - Yep.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:57.960]   - And speed and stuff.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.800]   - Yeah, well--
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.640]   - 'Cause as far as I could tell it,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.840]   reported ECC, reported the same.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.760]   It just wasn't painted black on the back.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.280]   - Keith will get right to it.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.120]   - Yeah.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:06.960]   - All right, I'm bringing it up.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.800]   - He's much more techy than I am.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.440]   - And I'm superstitious, so I'm using the Apple module,
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.480]   not the $75 module I bought.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.880]   'Cause the Apple module is 200 bucks,
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.560]   so I think it's better.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.080]   - You need a Mac Pro, you need to come up with a Mac Pro.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:18.920]   - Yeah, silently.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.120]   - You need an energy bar.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:23.520]   - Why does he tell him?
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.360]   - We need like a--
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.280]   - He needs a monocle.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.760]   If he had a monocle in the age of--
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.480]   - Tim Cook with a bar.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.400]   - Okay, for the folks, we need to see a Photoshop
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.880]   of Tim Cook with a monocle before the end of the show.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.720]   - I think that's what he needs.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.720]   - There's your Mac break challenge.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.560]   - There's your Mac break challenge.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.560]   - He needs.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:39.920]   - Every, and it's, I don't blame Apple.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:40.840]   Everybody does it.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.160]   And some of them use this tool you're talking about.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.120]   Everybody does it.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.720]   - Oh, it's the future.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.120]   - But I can get great customer service from anybody.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.000]   I just tweet my problem.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:50.840]   - Yes.
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   - And then all of a sudden they go,
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.160]   "Oh my God, he has half a million followers."
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.600]   This might mean something.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.000]   Why don't you treat everybody that way?
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:56.840]   That's ridiculous.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.120]   - Or followers in many of the companies
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.440]   that you're gonna be tweeting about.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:00.440]   (laughing)
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.160]   - Oh my God, oh my God.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.640]   And I know that 3/4 of those followers are spam bots.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.080]   - Bless him.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.640]   - Thank you, thank you spam bots.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.440]   - I think, you know, I think obviously--
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.280]   - You're giving me clout.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.440]   - I think a lot of people work pretty hard
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.960]   at treating everyone pretty well.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.640]   But it would be crazy for a company
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:22.640]   to know who someone is and not, you know, sort it out.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.760]   You know, put it on.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.600]   - What's that called?
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.440]   - Radien 6.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.440]   - Radien 6.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.440]   It's from Salesforce.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.280]   - It is.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.360]   - Also, you know, you can't discount the fact
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.320]   that some of the people who work for these companies
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.120]   are actual humans.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.160]   And I'll give you a personal example.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.320]   One of my favorite web cartoonists, Daniel Cressado,
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.200]   mentioned that, "Hey, I'm gonna be in Boston.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.800]   "I'm gonna be doing a research trip.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.280]   "And I'm such a big fan of course."
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.800]   I direct messages, "Yeah, I live in the Boston area.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.680]   "If you would like me to photograph anything
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:55.000]   "or research anything, you'd be great to, you know,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.360]   "to be, you know, help you out."
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.280]   'Cause a big fan of the strip,
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.200]   I mentioned I'm a fan of the strip.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.040]   I've been following you since the Black and White Day
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.680]   before you went into digital, you know.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:02.520]   So I don't know.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.000]   There's always the possibility to someone said,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.280]   "Oh, well, geez, this person has a,
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.160]   "this person whose work I like has a problem
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.520]   "that I can solve very, very quickly
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.680]   "and very, very efficiently.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.800]   "Certainly much easier than they can solve with themselves.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.280]   "I would enjoy engaging that small amount of time
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.960]   "and effort to solving this person's problem."
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.320]   - Yeah.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   - I'm not saying this what happened.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.920]   I'm saying that, eh.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.080]   - No, we're human beings.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.160]   You know, we like who we like.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.880]   People who have friends always have,
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.680]   get better treatment, right?
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:28.960]   - Oh, I mean, you know, as Genniss.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.760]   - And Ellen DeGeneres is always gonna get
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.560]   a nicer phone from Samsung than I am.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:34.400]   - That's what it is.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.040]   - That's because she gets a lot more retweet.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.080]   - And she's gonna still use her iPhone backstage
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:38.920]   at the US, 'cause--
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.240]   (laughing)
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.440]   - Tell you what, Leo, if you can get like four Oscar winners
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.720]   and seven Oscar nominees inside the studio
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.000]   to take a picture with you,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.600]   I'm sure whatever phone you want,
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.120]   whatever my five-year-old be.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.360]   - Especially they know it's coming.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.840]   - I know.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.160]   - The iPhone C, John Brownlee, writing in Cult of Mac,
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.880]   RIP, iPhone 5C, you're a flop.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.560]   The detail from analytics platform,
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.360]   Mixpanel shows that the growth of the 5C
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:10.200]   is stagnant at about 6% as it has been since Christmas.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.960]   Even though the 5S has achieved a 20% share
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.560]   of the phone market overtaking the iPhone 4S,
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:20.120]   let's get the close up of this.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:25.120]   The purple, the bottom one is the oldest iPhones.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:30.040]   The next one up, the teal is the 5C, that's pathetic.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.040]   Then the 5S, the yellow you see is taking over.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.720]   The iPhone 4 is dipping now below the line.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:38.520]   I don't, I need this.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.800]   Somebody to do play-by-play here.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   - I need 300.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.840]   (laughs)
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.880]   - The purple, the blue one, I don't know what that is,
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.880]   then there's this one, what is this one, that's the--
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.240]   - I think it's the iPhone 5.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.080]   - Yeah, and then--
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.440]   (laughs)
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.920]   - We do wanna see the 4S and the 5 are still on.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.680]   - Okay, here's the blue green line,
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.960]   but then there's the greenish blue line.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.680]   - Oh, it's not the green wire with the red thread,
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.920]   the red wire with the green thread.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.680]   - The point being that really the iPhone 5C
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.600]   is just not taken off if you look at it.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.160]   Now, I'm not sure what they're, how they're measuring it.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.280]   They say this report was generated from 201 billion records.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.720]   I don't know what that means even,
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.280]   but that's how this company does it.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.760]   So really, I guess with that many samples,
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.960]   this is a pretty accurate measurement.
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.800]   It's about what you think.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.280]   So does Apple kill the 5C?
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.280]   I guess they do and the rumors are they're not gonna do
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.240]   a plastic-backed phone again.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.080]   - It was cool, I think they just really,
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   they didn't go far enough in one direction or the other,
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.320]   and I think they just got a condom between.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.160]   I think that's the issue.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.440]   - The 5C, I have a 4C and I think it's really great,
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.520]   but it is, it's just a 5.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.880]   And I think that people who buy Apple products
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.040]   more than normal people want the latest greatest.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.520]   - Well, I think they also made some compelling,
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.720]   enough compelling stuff on the 5S that people were like,
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.960]   well, I really, once you get close to that price,
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.880]   if it was a 5C, - It's only $100, yeah.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:04.360]   - I think if the 5C was $200 or $200 less,
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.600]   I think you probably would have seen a much larger,
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.800]   but of course, the Apple would have given up
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.760]   a lot more margin too, but I think that,
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.000]   I think at $100 difference, and you look between the C
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.800]   and the S, you're like, well, I'll spend extra $100
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.280]   for the S.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.760]   - I think the job of the iPhone 5C was,
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.880]   typically Apple reduces the price of the previous year's
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.960]   iPhone by $100 and that becomes a second tier model.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.240]   The job of the iPhone 5C wasn't to sell billions,
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.640]   it wasn't to be a summer blockbuster,
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:32.800]   it was to be the iPhone 5 in a way that was easier
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.480]   and cheaper for Apple to manufacture.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.680]   So the only question is, did it sell better than an iPhone 5
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.840]   would have sold in that slot against the iPhone 5S?
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.720]   And was it cheaper for Apple to make
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.880]   so they made more money off it
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.800]   than if they had just dropped the iPhone 5?
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.680]   And the answer to both those questions might be yes,
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.960]   it could be that the iPhone 5S would have just blown
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.360]   the iPhone 5 out of the water too,
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.040]   and the iPhone 5 had more manufacturing difficulty
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:55.240]   than the 5C did.
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.600]   - I really like the 5C, it's cute, it's cuddly.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.880]   It's nice and I actually see them out
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.640]   and about by people who really do just,
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.880]   they go into the store, they are able to buy
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:06.960]   pretty much any phone they want
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.520]   and they want the one that has the really cool pink back to it.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.360]   - Yeah.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.960]   - And Marines, Marines, right?
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.000]   Too many people look at, well,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.360]   what's your percent of market share?
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.800]   Oh, well, Jesus, it's not increasing
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.880]   and it's not taking a share of it,
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.760]   that must be a complete flop and they're gonna get rid of it.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.880]   There's so many different reasons
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:23.480]   why a company puts a product on the market
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.200]   and sometimes it really is just to hold that space
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.520]   in the product line until a bigger plan emergency
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.360]   in a year or two.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.440]   - I don't think it's necessarily gimme
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.880]   that the 5C is gonna be canceled.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.480]   - I look at my daughter who wanted a 5C
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.400]   'cause she liked the color back,
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.560]   she got it for Christmas, she broke it,
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.880]   gave her my 5S, she says,
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.960]   "Oh, this is a really nice phone."
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.960]   And she says, "You can keep the 5C."
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:46.160]   - 5S is a great phone.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.000]   - Which she liked it at.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.160]   - Like, who do you think looks better in a monocle,
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.080]   me or Tim Cook?
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.240]   - Well played.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.160]   - Interesting, I'd like to see figures, for example,
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:55.920]   the Galaxy S Mini or the HTC One Mini
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.200]   to see how the second tier,
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:59.000]   because it looks like Apple gets a lot of this attention
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.520]   regardless of the market.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.920]   - It didn't mean to wake you.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   And it's also possible,
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.440]   keep in mind that Apple is probably gonna come up
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.440]   with a real large screen phone later this year.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.840]   It's possible that the 5C's role is to maintain
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.400]   that slot as the compact sized iPhone.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.880]   It's hard to see a major manufacturer
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.960]   that doesn't make both a big screen
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.760]   and a small screen version of the same phone.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.240]   Samsung makes nine versions of each phone.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.040]   Sony has different versions of the Xperia,
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.400]   the HTC has different sizes of the HTC One.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.360]   So I would not be surprised to learn
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.400]   that the long range game plan has always been
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.880]   that the 5C is gonna be the phone
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.120]   that maintains the beachhead of the iPhone
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.720]   as a tiny, shirt pocketable phone
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.640]   that will be very, very approachable
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.040]   to people with smaller hands,
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.360]   such as, I don't know, women.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.480]   - I think Truckee nailed it,
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.080]   and we're gonna wrap it up with his thought.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.920]   Arnold Schwarzenegger would not buy a 5C.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.600]   Gorgeous George, would.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.480]   - I told the 5C to get the hell out of here.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.320]   - Well, I don't like it.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.040]   - I don't like it as George banging the house
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.000]   with a banging one of the maids and having a little.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.040]   - iTunes Radio Pass is Spotify now.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.760]   Number three in streaming music, Pandora is number one
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.280]   with a massive 31% market share.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.280]   Then iHeartRadio 9%, iTunes Radio 8%, Spotify 6,
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.840]   Google 3, Rhapsody 2, Slack and Choo.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.920]   - Now is this streaming, is this just the radio service
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   or is this the actual usage?
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.680]   - Just the US, 'cause half of those don't exist.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.760]   - This is the US.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.160]   But I mean, with Spotify, I never use the radio.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.480]   - Streaming music.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.040]   So that means it could be radio.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.880]   So for instance, Google Play, they have a radio,
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.960]   but you can also stream any song.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.600]   Spotify has a radio, but you can also stream any song.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.280]   - 'Cause I use the playlist and Spotify all the time.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.800]   And I'm just wondering if that's--
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.960]   - Pandora is just Pandora, you know,
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.120]   it's just streaming radio, but I think that all iHeartRadio
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.440]   is radio stations plus Pandora style radio music.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.520]   But iTunes obviously could stream songs.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.160]   Here's the subscription service.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.680]   So they're lumping them all in.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.600]   This is "Percent of Americans" age 12 and over,
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.880]   who listened in the last month.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.440]   Edison research.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.600]   - I don't get the, I have to admit,
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.560]   I don't get the radio thing at all,
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.960]   because I just, I keep on skipping,
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.160]   and then I have to, with Pandora,
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.840]   I would keep on skipping, like no, no, no, no.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.840]   - You don't skip six times on a station,
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.320]   and then, but can you skip--
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.160]   - That's why I just went to Spotify.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.000]   - It's one of Spotify.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.280]   - Spotify, just listen to whatever I want.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280]   - Yeah, I'd say--
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.560]   - I haven't, I just saw radio,
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.000]   I saw the radio part, and I was like, okay.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.120]   - No, that's because Pandora is different.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.520]   You know, your iTunes, Spotify, Google,
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.400]   you're paying a subscription service
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.040]   for their entire library.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.400]   So you can build a playlist--
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.240]   - Yeah, I like the--
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.120]   - And build a playlist.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.320]   - That's what a radio station is just a self,
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.720]   an automatically built playlist, basically.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.600]   - Who could-- - I'll still keep in mind
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.120]   that iTunes Radio is the only one of these services
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.600]   that comes built into a hugely popular phone.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.080]   - I think that's gonna help a lot.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.280]   - Pandora and Spotify are sometimes come
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.400]   with certain models, but that's,
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.720]   I think that's skeeling the results a little bit.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.560]   - Yeah.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:04.200]   Who does a better job if you guys have an opinion
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.920]   of predictive radio play?
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.400]   So the way Pandora works, you give it an artist
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.040]   and then it makes a station saying,
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.000]   well, if you like that artist,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.840]   you're gonna like all these guys.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.720]   So does I, heart radio, so does iTunes,
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.280]   so does Google, who does the best of those?
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.280]   - No, I can hear them.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.160]   - I think Pandora, I gotta give it to him.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.960]   - They own that space.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.320]   - Yeah, I mean, the number of times that I've encountered
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.960]   an app, a starting off with a favorite song
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.480]   and then four songs in having to actually
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.280]   walk back to the phone to mark that one
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.840]   'cause I wanna buy that one later on.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.320]   It's such a high hit rate that I kind of have
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.160]   to not use Pandora as much as I would like.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.520]   - Apple TV 6.1 update, you can finally hide,
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.120]   well, actually you could always hide channels
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.800]   in parental controls, but now it's a little bit easier.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.400]   They needed that, that's the wrong story.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.920]   They needed that because there were a lot of channels.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.920]   It was going all the way down to the thing.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.040]   - A lot of channels that no one's using.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.120]   - Yeah, a lot of below the fold channels.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.240]   So now there is an arrange menu items.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.440]   This update came out yesterday, you can easily add it
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.200]   to arrange or hide a selected item in the main.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.960]   I like arrange 'cause I could put all the stuff
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.920]   I like on the top.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.760]   - Right.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.760]   - Everything else below the fold, I don't have to hide it.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.680]   It's the jiggle mode.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.200]   So you press and hold select until the item jiggles
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.400]   and press the directional buttons to move it.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:31.840]   And then or you can sort, right?
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:32.680]   Is that what ABC means?
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.760]   - The arrange has been there before,
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.000]   I think it's the hide that's new.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.560]   - Arrange has always been there?
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.640]   - Well, it's been jiggly mode
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.120]   and being able to move more out a lot.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:40.960]   - Really?
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.800]   - Oh, I never saw that.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.680]   - I remember it from a couple generations ago.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.520]   - I remember it.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.360]   - Am I learning?
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.200]   - I remember it.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.040]   - I'm learning.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.040]   - But the hide is new and very welcome.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.560]   - Apple, asshole.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.600]   (laughing)
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.840]   Now I'm gonna get another call from the executives.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.640]   - Assel, Apple has also updated.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.280]   (laughing)
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.640]   - Has also updated the remote app for iOS.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.560]   What?
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.400]   - I don't think it's pretty bad.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.240]   - All my god.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.320]   - The NDAs are the more the so-on-sale.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.160]   (laughing)
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   - That's a sale for the problem.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.560]   - No longer an issue, huh?
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.520]   (laughing)
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.680]   There is an update to the remote.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.200]   - Yeah, almost everything yesterday.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.000]   - Well, the 4.2, that was the app
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.880]   that they didn't update for like two years.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.840]   - It's like the guy who wrote it was the reassigned.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.720]   - I have to say that if you're a parent,
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.040]   you definitely need the remote for your Apple TV
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.680]   because it does not show your code when you're entering it.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.680]   - Oh.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.520]   - I have to change my code.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.080]   Like now that my son has turned six,
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.400]   I have to change the code like once a week.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.640]   - So he watches Dad enter it
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.560]   and then steals your password?
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.400]   - He does.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.240]   - Son of a guy.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.120]   - He's a little devil dog.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.880]   - Goosh, goosh, goosh.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.320]   - And here's the worst part, is he acts like he's not looking.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.560]   Like there's this whole process,
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.640]   it took me a little while to realize
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.640]   he was ordering stuff.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.480]   - Wow.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.320]   - That's epic.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.120]   - Have you shown him that scene from "The early"
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.000]   in fact, one of the casino where,
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.680]   where De Niro catches the casino cheat
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.600]   and enters into the circular saw?
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.440]   (laughing)
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.880]   - I have my show and then I was thinking,
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.160]   I was thinking of showing it to him
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.560]   and then I thought that my wife might kill me.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.360]   So I actually do it.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.640]   - Okay, kid, I'll make you a deal.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.640]   You can either have the Simpson's donuts or your fingers.
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.280]   You can't have both, which is gonna be.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.240]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.440]   Actually, this is huge because they've now added the ability
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.720]   in the remote app, which they really never really took
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.320]   advantage of the fact that they have a screen and everything.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:30.040]   Now you can actually browse movies you've purchased.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.200]   You can look at what you've got.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.920]   - Here's all I want out of my,
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.400]   I mean, maybe I'm missing something, but in my iPad,
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.160]   I just, when I go to my movies,
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.760]   I just wanna know which ones are on the iPad.
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.360]   Is there some sort method other than looking
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.560]   for the little cloud?
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.720]   - Well, I see it's a vise.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.640]   - This is insanely frustrated.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.600]   - You can't help, you can put it in Airplane mode
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.200]   and it'll only show you the ones that are on device.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.040]   - Oh, it's just so, like, if you're gonna do an update,
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.320]   like, I just wanna know which ones are there.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.000]   I have a lot of movies that I bought on,
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   against the ND's recommendation that I own on my iOS apps.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.280]   And so I open it up and there's just all these movies
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.720]   and I don't, and I have to like scroll through,
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.680]   like which ones did I actually download on the flight?
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.520]   - You put it in Airplane mode,
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.240]   it'll just show you the ones that are downloaded.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.880]   - So even if you have not lost your remote
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.240]   for your Apple TV, which is--
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.080]   - Oh no, you still use it.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.080]   - Easy to lose.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.640]   - I use it all the time.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.480]   It's even funnier is I have the same operandies,
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.360]   I have the same wireless in my back office
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.600]   than so I can change the--
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.320]   - That's clever.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.320]   - I choose clever.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.680]   - Yeah, you know.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.600]   - Take over.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.160]   - I find it very easy to misplace that tiny remote,
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.640]   so having it on your phone and your iPad
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.600]   is a very handy thing.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.440]   - Yes.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:45.320]   - Let's see, I just accidentally--
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.520]   - I take all the old computer ones and I give them to my kids.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.800]   That's the one that like floats around
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.400]   'cause the metal one, damn.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.240]   - Are you the old plastic ones?
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.400]   - Yeah, I don't like them.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.880]   - But let them in half though.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.200]   - They can have those.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.200]   'Cause eventually you find like three of them stuffed
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.480]   in the couch.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.320]   - Yeah.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:07.800]   Macworld says, "We shall see from their lips
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.880]   "to Satya Nadella's ears that Microsoft
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:12.680]   "will release a new version of Microsoft Office
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.040]   "for the Mac this year."
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.720]   - We got something.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.040]   - The last one's three years old.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:23.200]   Office 20, Mac 2011.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:27.080]   You can use it, and I do use it this way
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.000]   as part of an Office 365 subscription.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.360]   So I pay 10 bucks a month, I get five installs.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.960]   Any one of, or any of them could be Mac or Windows.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.800]   - I don't use it anymore.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.640]   - That's handy.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.840]   Microsoft folded its Mac business unit
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.040]   into its business software unit in 2010
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.480]   and then shut down the Mac Office.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.280]   So there's nothing's been going on,
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.440]   but apparently it's Seabit,
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.520]   the Thorsten Hoopschen, which is the German Office boss.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.880]   - I'm first off.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.840]   - So there are new development teams
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.960]   for each of the Office applications,
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.880]   which each produce versions of their product
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.800]   for different platforms.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.160]   So I guess the word group produces word
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.600]   for Windows, Mac OS, iOS and Android.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.880]   We do believe there will be iPad versions soon
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.720]   as well.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.600]   - Just quick enough not to be relevant anymore.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.960]   - They did close the Office for Mac blog on Monday.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.280]   That's kind of a bad sign.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.640]   Hoopschen says there'll be more news
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:27.040]   in the second quarter of this year.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.360]   That's beginning next month.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.480]   He said Microsoft's already talking to large customers
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.400]   about the new Mac package behind closed doors.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.320]   So they must be working.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.480]   In fact, I represented for Microsoft
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.960]   and confirmed that they're developing it.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.880]   But what does that mean?
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.360]   They've been developing it for years, I'm sure.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.840]   The team is hard at work, they say,
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.880]   on the next version of Office for the Mac.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.200]   While I don't have details to share on timing,
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.880]   when it's available, Office 365 subscribers
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.320]   will automatically get the next Office for Mac.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.200]   No additional costs.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.160]   That's a good thing.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.360]   - Coco, what's that?
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:58.200]   Are they still carbon?
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.360]   - I think 2011 was carbon, wasn't it?
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.400]   - Of course it was.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:05.200]   You know, I confess that I install it
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.480]   because I mean, you Excel, there's no,
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.520]   I'm sorry, numbers is not as good as Excel.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.360]   - It's not what you're doing.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.080]   - Depending, if you really want to do number crunching.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.160]   - If you really want it, like--
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.240]   - If you want it beautiful--
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.080]   - We have to think about how many people
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.400]   are really doing number crunching.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.680]   - If you're doing table seating charts,
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.880]   numbers is the best.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.760]   If you want to do pivot tables
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.640]   on last year's quarterly projections--
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.480]   - Absolutely, I agree with you.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.320]   - I really do.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.600]   - It's just that I think that most people don't do that.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.240]   And so they use Excel, which is a horrid little beast.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.680]   You know, and numbers is this beautiful thing
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.040]   that you can customize, you can move your sheets around,
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.200]   you can have multiple tables, you can reorganize them,
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.800]   you can make them look pretty, you can,
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.360]   I mean, like, I hand off numbers, documents,
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.840]   that are doing some pretty complicated calculations
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.840]   to clients and they're like, how did you do this in Excel?
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.480]   I'm like, oh, I did not do that in Excel.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.320]   You can-- - And the online version
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.520]   has to do that. - Yeah, and so,
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.560]   I don't know, I don't understand.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.520]   I mean, we don't, I don't, if I can't open it in pages
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.880]   or in Google Docs, I'm not interested.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.120]   It's just those are the two that we use at this point.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.600]   Oh, by the way, I want to thank Web 1750
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.240]   and a couple of other folks that were in the IRC
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.000]   in the settings under in videos,
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.840]   you can turn off, show all videos,
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.280]   I stand corrected in my little complaint,
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.520]   and then all those extra videos disappeared.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.840]   All right, I got another complaint,
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.880]   and I don't know if this is true,
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.120]   at least it was telling me about this.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.800]   Her son likes to watch YouTube videos
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.640]   on his iPhone in the car for hours
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.160]   and has used up all the data on her family plan,
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.080]   eight gigabytes a month.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.640]   Wow, played. - Wow.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.240]   Halfway through, did you get one already for this month?
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.280]   - It's only the 10th.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:44.080]   It renews on the fifth, so you've got a few more days, okay.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:49.560]   So apparently, if I understood this,
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.960]   and we did this while I was walking,
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.320]   so I don't know if I was getting all the blood
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.440]   to my brain properly, but in this, oh, see,
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.360]   I don't have an iPad, so it's not gonna work.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.200]   Maybe you could do this.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.520]   - So in, so. - So in,
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.040]   you can set a passcode
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.200]   so that they can't change the cell phone settings,
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.480]   so that you could turn off data,
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.400]   she wants to turn off data on the cell phone
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.240]   and not have-- - You wanna turn it
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.080]   off to YouTube.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.280]   - Him be, no, just turn off cell phone data.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.880]   So he can watch YouTube when he's at home,
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.520]   that's fine, 'cause it's on wifi,
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.000]   but she wants to turn off cellular data after a certain point.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.480]   - I don't think cell data is a passcode protected setting.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.400]   - Well, it says, if you look, there's a passcode,
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.560]   don't change phone's data settings.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.520]   - Let's try.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.800]   - And then it asked for a passcode, a new passcode,
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.760]   she gave it one, and she could still turn data back on.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.960]   So there's no way to do that?
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.440]   I don't have an iPhone in front of me, so I can't.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.280]   - Trying.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.280]   - I can't show you.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.640]   I'll just an assignment for the chatroom.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.680]   While we're working on that, let's catch it mad.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.440]   John Chan, CEO of Blackberry, says,
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.920]   "iPhone users are wall huggers."
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   - Oop.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.760]   - You know, there's a pretty obscure--
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.600]   - Where is this guy?
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.000]   - There's a pretty obscure reference there.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.600]   Like when he said it, I was like, what is he talking about?
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.000]   - I thought it was like tree hugger,
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.720]   but what he means is you don't have enough juice
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.680]   to last a day, so you gotta hug the wall.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:15.680]   - I will say, I would happily pay $100 more for my iPhone
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.080]   for it to be twice as thick and last for two days.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:18.920]   - How about this?
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.920]   How much would you pay now?
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.480]   An alarm clock that wafts bacon odors from your iPhone,
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.320]   Oscar Meyer-- - What is wrong
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.160]   with these people?
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.240]   (laughing)
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.960]   - It's the Oscar Meyer Bacon Alarm Clock/Publicity stunt.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.360]   Wake up and smell the bacon, it's an iPhone app.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.240]   You can download for free, but you have to buy
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:41.080]   the small device that plugs into the headphone jack
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:41.920]   of your iPhone.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.200]   - Can you really, as someone actually ordered this,
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.320]   I think this is all a hoax.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.520]   - The app will show a video of cooking bacon
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.880]   and then spew vaporized bacon sent into the air,
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.000]   while a soothing voice talks about the wonders
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.240]   of the meaty product.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.800]   - But where's the hardware here?
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.640]   I think this is one--
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.120]   - It's free, what do you care?
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.520]   - I think it's one giant publicity stunt.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.800]   It's a great-- - 'Cause it is the craziest,
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.600]   most stupid thing I have ever heard about.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.520]   - It's a great publicity stunt.
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.040]   - Tap to snooze.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.440]   - When you snooze though, there's a little bug
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.680]   that bacon odor does not go away.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.800]   It's all in your mind.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.920]   There is no hardware.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.240]   - Look at that, don't you smell it right now?
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.280]   If there's any app where you don't want your kid
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.920]   coming in and changing your settings on you,
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.080]   'cause I don't wanna wake up to something other than bacon.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.000]   That would be, I'd wake the hell up,
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.760]   but that would be it.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.480]   - It could be torture for vegetarians.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.440]   - I've gotta get out of bed, all I can smell is bacon.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.720]   - Leo?
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.960]   - I experimented with the settings,
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.480]   and what it does is lock out the use cellular data for
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.360]   and in a list of apps, so you have--
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.080]   - So you have to do it by app.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.360]   So there you go, Lisa. - Yeah, it gets better.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.120]   - So you could disable cellular data for YouTube,
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.400]   which you should do.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400]   There that does it, thank you.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.680]   Renee Richie to the rescue.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.600]   You guessed the-- - Press buttons till it worked.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.880]   - I'm gonna send you a vegan alarm clock.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.520]   - Thank you.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.600]   - How much does Shaquille O'Neal spend?
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.880]   Would you like to take a guess?
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.600]   This is from the prestigious Wall Street Journal.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.480]   Oh, you can't guess because it's right there on the screen.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.680]   $1,000 a week on apps, apparently.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.600]   - It's the whale.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.520]   - He got money. - He got money.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.480]   His Twitter account was the very first account
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.040]   verified by Twitter.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.640]   He was a pre-IPO investor in Google,
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.640]   and according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.640]   in his constant search to find the next cool thing
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:30.640]   in technology, he installs $1,000 worth of apps.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.400]   He's particularly interested in deer hunting games.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.440]   Are there deer hunting?
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.200]   Maybe those are in-app purchases.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.800]   - $100 in-app deer hunter purchase.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.640]   - Yeah, let's see.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.160]   Here he is.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.000]   Good Lord.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.360]   She's very small.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.200]   He actually is a giant.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.160]   Holy cow.
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.640]   Can you get my audio there?
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.520]   Is that not, let me--
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.280]   - Google, one of the first verified
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.000]   users of Twitter seems like every few years,
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.280]   you get a little bit more and more.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.520]   - Why do they put the music in there?
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.800]   How does the music help?
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.880]   - I don't know.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.440]   - You know what that music says to me?
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.600]   We know you don't care about this at all,
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.960]   so we're gonna play a soundtrack.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   - We get really interested.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.960]   - Exactly.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.800]   - Leecial dance.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.080]   - It also makes it hard for someone else
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:14.920]   to put their own audio there.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.160]   - Dastings up on like 20--
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.480]   - Oh, maybe that's it.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.280]   - Like hunting the deer on my phone.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.760]   - I like hunting the deer on my phone.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.360]   - Love to smell it like he doesn't work nearly as well.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.200]   - I like that you know,
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.440]   make your phone is not gonna work.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.920]   - Or the strangest news apps that you have on your phone,
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.280]   or what are you using your day to day night?
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.320]   - Is there any blue jeans?
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.640]   - It's a social media, you know,
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.640]   my breakdown has always been the same.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.440]   60% to make you laugh,
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.080]   because laughing relieves stress.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.280]   - Well, there's lots to make you laugh on that.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.240]   That means he has deer hunting and fart apps.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.680]   - You're gonna laugh at it.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.400]   30% to inspire you.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.240]   That could be a quote that could lift your day or--
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.040]   - I think he rebalances his apps every few weeks,
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.520]   just to make sure he's got 60, 30%.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.080]   - And then the last 10%,
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.760]   I'm selling you stuff, I'm selling you Fitbit,
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.480]   I'm selling you soda cap,
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.720]   I'm selling you I see how I'm telling you you're beautiful.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.200]   - I'm selling you I see hot.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.440]   - That's how I break how I use social media.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.600]   You know, for me, it's not always about bragging.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.840]   Look, I just bought a car,
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.800]   car cost $2.2 million,
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.800]   I'm the first on winter, I've never done that.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.120]   So, and I'm the one who won the reason
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.800]   for the first verify to count on Twitter.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.720]   - Well, all right, I've had enough.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.360]   - I do it for very different reasons.
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:30.080]   - So just so you know, 10% of all Shaquille O'Neal's tweets
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.240]   are to sell you stuff.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.080]   - There you go.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.200]   - Just so you know. - I see hot.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.040]   - I see hot.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.400]   Do you think he uses I see hot?
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.200]   I tried it once, it burns.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.480]   Maybe is where I put it.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.320]   - There's definitely places to burn.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.160]   - Freezes to burn.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.800]   - Not to put I see hot.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.640]   We're gonna take a break.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.240]   Will we come back your picks of the week gentlemen?
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.800]   Are you prepared?
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.000]   - Oh, I'm ready.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:49.840]   - You never be?
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:52.000]   - By the way, Twitter's back and they've changed
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:52.840]   the interface again.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.840]   - Oh, that's why it was down.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.680]   - That's why it was down.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.840]   So we have a new Twitter.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.840]   - It's no longer connections, it's now notifications.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.680]   - Yes.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.040]   - Everything we're able to do again.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.640]   - That's why we can't have nice websites.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.880]   (laughing)
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.800]   - I don't like change.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.560]   I think we've established that.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.760]   - Ladies and gentlemen, I show today
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.880]   brought to you by 99 Designs,

[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.440]   20, 40 or 50.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.440]   We liked him so much, we actually bought five.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.560]   Here's the hoodie that we designed or got designed.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.440]   What is the name of the designer on this, you know?
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.320]   Let's find out his name.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.400]   So, her name, we knew, but this is our hoodie.

[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.320]   Nice.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.040]   And we got four more T-shirt designs out of that thing.

[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.280]   - That's gonna be something.

[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.600]   - $299, 'cause we're generous.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.440]   - Not without our powerpoint system.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:53.960]   - Yeah, we're not our advertising kit.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:55.680]   - Our marketing kit, our media kit,

[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.320]   somebody said, boy, that looks bad and dated.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.880]   So, we went to 99designs, we got a great new design.
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.000]   And our new PowerPoint presentation.

[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.800]   This is, unfortunately, you caught me
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.080]   trying to switch to split.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.200]   - Yeah, I don't have to, if you want,
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.640]   if you want a little more time.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.480]   - I think he'll be a little more time.

[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.200]   - That's right.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.960]   - So, I'm using my slot to give a shout out
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.320]   to Macworld iWorld, which is gonna take place
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.880]   on March 27th of this month of, just said March.

[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.400]   Ever since Apple pulled out,
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:19.320]   they have done a great job in making it more,
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.600]   less about Apple and more about the Apple community.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.240]   And they have a show floor filled with developers
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.440]   and accessory manufacturers that you can go and visit
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.440]   and buy stuff with.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.280]   And a lot of them have really great deals.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.640]   Or if you have a problem with a certain app,
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.600]   you can go and talk to the person who actually made it
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:36.120]   and give them your feedback.
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.920]   They also have a bunch of courses of sessions.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.720]   I'm gonna be doing two this year.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.600]   I'm doing one on iCloud and exactly what it is
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.080]   and how to get the most out of it.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.720]   And I'm gonna do a second one on the contextual awakening,
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.720]   which is how we're using sensors and location
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.120]   and Ibeacons and sort of not intelligence,
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.680]   but more of awareness in our new products
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:59.360]   and all the new technologies that those are gonna unlock.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.520]   And then there's all sorts of events,
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:04.080]   like there's concerts and there's parties.
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.200]   It's just a great place.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.640]   It's the Mac and Apple and iOS community made manifest
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.760]   on Earth for a couple of days every year.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.400]   And again, outside of Apple's shadow,
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.760]   you have all these little flowers that are finally blooming
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.200]   and it is a great show.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.160]   I enjoy going every year.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.560]   I've gone for five years, I think now,
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.640]   which is a baby compared to a lot of people I realize,
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.720]   but I'm still having a blast every year.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.200]   And you can check it out at macworldeyeworld.com.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.560]   They still have tickets available.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.840]   - Absolutely.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:31.680]   - Absolutely.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.040]   And in fact, we're trying to decide
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.240]   how we should cover this.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.320]   It's not a big trade show anymore.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.560]   It's really all about the community.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.960]   - Well, I should mention that I'm gonna kick it off
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.840]   with Jason Sennell, Christina Warren,
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:47.560]   and Ben Bajaren on Thursday morning at 10 o'clock
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.400]   on the main stage.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.240]   - Can we stream it?
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:52.000]   - I think they might be.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.280]   - Oh, they'll probably stream it, huh?
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.000]   Yeah, that would be well worth watching.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.920]   I mean, those are all of the best people.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:01.600]   Is Ben Bajaren Tim's brother?
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.440]   - Son.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.280]   - Son?
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.120]   - Yes.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:04.960]   - Wow.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.800]   - They're both fantastic.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.760]   Ben has, there's financial analysts
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.960]   for whom I have very little time
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.480]   and then there's industry analysts.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:14.280]   People like Ben, Benedict Evans, Ben Thompson,
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.400]   they're all named Ben strangely, Ben Bajaren,
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.080]   and they are fantastic because they can explain
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.480]   why these things really matter
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.720]   and what the numbers mean.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.200]   Because so often we get numbers
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.600]   and we're told what they mean
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.880]   and they actually mean something completely opposite.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:31.840]   - All righty, Macworld, iWorld, the Expo, March 27th,
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.720]   28th and 29th, that's a Thursday, Friday and Saturday
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.320]   at Moscone, North and San Francisco.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.680]   Renee will be there.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.520]   I will be there.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.720]   We will all be there.
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.920]   But definitely get there 10 a.m. on Thursday
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.280]   for the state of Apple technology.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.600]   That's gonna be a great panel.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.760]   You got Mashable iMore, Macworld,
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.360]   that's gonna be a great panel.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.680]   - It's an honor to be part of it.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.200]   - Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.640]   - So I have been doing some shooting,
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.960]   stitching of photographs.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.840]   We're doing a class right now.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:03.840]   I'm doing teaching a class right now in Rwanda
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.360]   on integration of real scenes and computer graphics
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.200]   and everything else.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.040]   I teach them from here,
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.400]   but we're shooting them here and I'm teaching the class there.
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.640]   And the software that I keep on coming back to
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.600]   when I wanna do the stitching,
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.080]   you really want a lot of control,
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.560]   is a program called PT GUI.
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:23.680]   - PT GUI, PT GUI.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.520]   - PT GUI.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.520]   - PT GUI.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520]   (laughing)
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.480]   - PT GUI sounds like part of the matrix.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:32.920]   Anyway, PT GUI and what it does is it's really kind of
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.400]   what a lot of people come back to,
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:39.600]   to stitch HDR's and panoramas and so on and so forth
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.280]   where you have a lot of control.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:45.920]   It's a little geekier than your average stitching software,
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.240]   but you can really put together a lot of,
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:51.960]   you can see sometimes it doesn't have to be a panorama,
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.880]   it can also just be a series of photos
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.880]   that might be very high resolution
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:59.840]   or you wanna stitch them all together seamlessly.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:00.680]   - Yeah.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.080]   - And it's just really a great no-nonsense tool
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.840]   to get that done.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.480]   So it's, here you can see,
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.440]   and I bet you can zoom in pretty far into that.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.600]   It's my guess.
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.400]   As you can see, a lot of these,
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.560]   sometimes we think of shooting these
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.120]   with really, really wide angles.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.640]   A lot of times I even shoot them with, you know,
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:20.160]   eight millimeter lenses,
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.000]   but the,
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.080]   but when you have control in Photoshop,
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.680]   I think someone, Reverb Mike mentioned Photoshop.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.920]   In Photoshop, you can definitely do some stitching,
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.040]   but I find that you have a lot more control
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:34.160]   if you're really getting serious about it with PT GUI.
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.520]   So you can see that there's a,
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.840]   potentially a lot of images there.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.600]   I think he has a list.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.560]   Yeah, this one's an eight.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:46.560]   What was it, 76,500 by 11,289?
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.320]   That's a, you know,
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.160]   to take photo.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.720]   - So is this a command line?
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.000]   - No, no, this has a GUI.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.520]   - Well, it says a GUI, but I mean, like,
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.360]   why do they say GUI?
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.440]   - Well, it started off as--
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.280]   - It used to be a command line.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.120]   - It used to be command line.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.040]   - Yeah, so it used to be very geeky.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:00.880]   (laughing)
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:01.720]   And so this is the--
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.560]   - I think I used it there.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.040]   - This is the Kyner-Gentler version of the command line.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.000]   And you're still on Photoshop.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   - Well, I think that for quick and easy stuff,
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.120]   I think Photoshop is, you know,
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.280]   I would not get into this unless you really wanna
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.760]   start really getting serious about it.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.760]   But Photoshop does a great job on its own
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:21.280]   if you're just doing a couple panoramas.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.680]   But when you start getting really serious
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.320]   and you're doing HDRs and you're trying to,
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.360]   you know, build these seamlessly,
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.760]   I think that this is still the app to--
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.960]   - The app of choice.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.360]   - Yep, to use, so--
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.600]   - PTC GUI.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.040]   - PT GUI.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.480]   - And how much?
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.880]   - I think that it is,
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.680]   I just, I have the, I don't know the company version,
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:43.560]   which has got a bunch of copies.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.600]   So I remember what the single version is.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.320]   It's in euros.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.320]   - I'm pretty sure I bought this.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.600]   - The pro version is 149 euros.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.720]   - Oh, it's pricey.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.880]   - Well, the personal license is 79 euros.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.480]   - Okay, that's like 100 bucks.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.600]   - 100 bucks, or 110 bucks, is that right?
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.440]   Anyway, so--
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.280]   - Awesome.
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.640]   - So it's not super expensive.
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.680]   Definitely for what it does.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.200]   If you're doing it for, you know, for your job,
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.640]   if you're doing it for fun, I probably stick with,
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:11.640]   if you're not serious about it,
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.160]   I'd probably stick with Photoshop.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.520]   If you have Photoshop, but it's a lot cheaper
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:17.080]   than Photoshop, this is all you're gonna do, yeah.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:21.760]   - Mr. Andy Nocko, are you ready now?
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.280]   - I am ready now.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.720]   My pick is a really cool iOS app called Waterlogged,
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.120]   W-A-T-E-R-L-O-G-U-E.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.240]   It's made by 10 Rocket.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:36.240]   And it's, I'm not a fan of like photo filter effects
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.320]   that take a really good picture
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.760]   and make it look like crap for Instagram.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.480]   And so you oftentimes you see like,
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.200]   oh, this is a watercolor effect
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.880]   where when it does, it screws up the image,
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.400]   it makes it blurry and looks freaky
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.800]   and screws up the colors.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.440]   But Waterlogged does though, it is completely different.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.920]   It takes a photo and it really tries to interpret it
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.160]   in a watercolor form.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.000]   So it's not a filter.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.200]   What it does is it looks for the shapes of,
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.680]   and the items that are inside that image
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.080]   and then uses a perceptive watercolor technique.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.280]   It uses the techniques that a watercolor artist would use
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.360]   in which you start with the lights
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.240]   that you move up to the darks.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.440]   But while you're, after you move on
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.400]   from like this light color to the dark color,
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.880]   the light color is still wet and it's still on the paper.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.320]   So it's seeping a little bit more.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.840]   And when you put more ink on that,
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.400]   so let me show you, it's really easy to use.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.880]   I'm afraid I can't get this.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.280]   I have the wrong cable unfortunately,
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.040]   but I can probably kind of monkey my way around it.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.360]   You just either take a picture with your iPad or iPhone
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:40.000]   or you just select something from the gallery
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.720]   and that's original.
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.480]   You can see what it's doing there.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.320]   It starts off by pulling out outlines
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.720]   and that really starts to build the image,
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:49.720]   again, color by color.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:53.560]   And you wind up with a really convincing watercolor
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.920]   sort of image.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.920]   And then it doesn't have a whole lot of manual controls.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:03.280]   You can ask for different interpretations of it.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.400]   So for instance, if you want more lines
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.000]   and if you want it to be more like white gaps in it,
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.600]   there's a different way to interpret it.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.360]   And as you see, it doesn't simply,
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.600]   it doesn't simply apply an image filter.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.040]   It has to repaint it with these new instructions.
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.320]   And boy, I really, I intended to just knock out
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.400]   a quick review of this Sunday night,
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.800]   but it was like having, remember the first time
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:28.760]   you bought or you owned a reciprocating saw
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.360]   and you cut and you do the job that you bought it for
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.040]   and then you really think, what else can I cut with this?
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:35.840]   'Cause it was fun cutting with this tool.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.920]   And the next thing you know that you have to buy a new sofa
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:40.440]   because your old sofa is in pieces.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.480]   So I really just find myself going through
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.440]   like every half way decent photo I'd ever taken
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.800]   to see what it could do to that image.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.640]   And to be sure, it doesn't do a great job with everything
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.240]   because it uses a wet on wet technique.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.040]   I find that sometimes you wind up
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.000]   with sort of an uncanny valley sort of effect
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.400]   because it's too accurate to be something
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.560]   that a human has done, but it's yet kind of watercolor-ish.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.240]   So it looks kind of weird.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.440]   But if you give it the right source image,
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:13.960]   man, it just produces such beautiful effects.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.480]   So good that there's some of these
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.480]   that I really now actually kind of want to print
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:22.480]   in large size and just hang on my wall there.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:24.040]   Works great if you have an image
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:26.440]   that is really high contrast like this one
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.800]   where there's a clear, nothing happened in the background,
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.160]   not a whole lot of detail.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.080]   I did try to give it a picture of a squirrel
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.000]   with lots of different fur, lots of different texture.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.440]   And it just kind of looked like,
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.560]   oh, there's kind of a grayish blob in the middle
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.400]   that could be a squirrel.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.680]   - I love that one though, that dog is great.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:44.640]   - Yeah, I mean, so it's only $2.99.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.440]   And man, you just will have so much fun
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.440]   handing it picture after picture to process
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.000]   just to see what it does with it.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.160]   And one out of every three is so good that you,
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.360]   okay, let's tweet that out or let's save that
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.200]   in high definition so I can print that
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.400]   and do something else that's cool with it.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.440]   It really does, and so I'm hopefully finishing
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.640]   that review today because it's expanded to like 50-100 words
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.240]   as I found myself having a debate with myself
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:14.120]   on the nature of art and what to say to somebody who says,
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.840]   no, that's not a real painting because you used
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.200]   an iOS app to process it and then saying,
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.040]   well, okay, what if there's something
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:24.040]   that took 30 seconds to do but it's brilliant
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.520]   and other thing took 10 hours to do and it was terrible.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:27.600]   Does the 10 hours work?
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.880]   And anyway, it's a great, great app.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.000]   You really have to do see it, too appreciated.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.160]   - What's it called again?
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.960]   - It's called Waterlogged, W-A-T-E-R-L-O-G-U-E.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.240]   And you can find it at waterlogapp.com.
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.600]   It's made by Tin Rocket.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:43.160]   You get three bucks, you'll get more fun on this
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.680]   and you get out of most games that you spend $3 for.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.680]   - So we showed on MacBrick, I mean, on iPad today,
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:51.720]   yesterday, a similar program called Brushstroke.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.080]   And I wanna compare the two.
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:56.320]   This is a picture I did a view in Brushstroke.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.360]   And I think, oh, you can't tell 'cause it's not,
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.120]   I gotta get it closer to you.
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.560]   But it looks like Van Gogh painted you.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.000]   And I just, we gotta compare the two.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:05.840]   - Yeah.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.840]   - I think I like Waterlogged better, frankly.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.760]   It's hard to compare 'cause Waterlog is the only such app
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.200]   that I've seen that really does,
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.960]   it doesn't simply say I'm going to do
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.360]   like a Photoshop filter on this.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:20.080]   It really is what happens if you put wet paint on,
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:23.200]   a piece of wet paper, and then you put more color onto it
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.600]   while the paper is still wet.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:25.440]   - Right.
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.640]   - And they always start to interact and bleed with each other.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.760]   I just don't, I just have never seen an image
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:30.720]   that's kind of like that.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:33.040]   It's interesting though, I do have an art,
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.200]   a watercolor artist took one of the photos that I shot
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.200]   a few years ago while I was reviewing a Nikon camera
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.520]   and said, "Gee, that's a really cool image.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:44.560]   "Do you mind if I base a watercolor painting off of that?"
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.400]   - Right.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.640]   - And so I was able to compare my photo
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.880]   to what this app would do with it
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:53.000]   versus what a real watercolor artist would do with it.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.720]   And really the signature differences that the artist
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.640]   does know that if that's an apple on the table,
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.880]   that's a chair in the background,
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.360]   I want to call attention to this, not that.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:06.200]   Whereas the watercolor app doesn't know
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.400]   that there's a human figure in there,
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.360]   doesn't know that there's a table behind them,
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.040]   doesn't know that there's a tree.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:12.680]   It just sees things that are in focus,
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.480]   things that are non-focus, shapes that are light,
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.600]   shapes that are dark.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:19.320]   But the effects are just really terrific.
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:24.320]   - I'm gonna tweet my picture of you from Brushstroke.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.560]   And you tell, I love the idea of turning into an oil painting.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.680]   - And it's not even, I should say, my belief,
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.840]   it's not even that I think that it should look exactly
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.840]   like a watercolor.
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.160]   It's okay if it looks like a really pretty image
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.160]   that was generated from a computer.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.520]   - Yeah.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.440]   - But it's interesting that it's possible to write an app
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.640]   like Waterlog that gives you the exact same,
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.480]   the same effect that you're expecting to see.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:51.760]   - Not a good look right there.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.240]   (laughing)
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:55.320]   - I think Andy's came out better.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.960]   - All right, Waterlog, they're the same price,
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.440]   Waterlog or Brushstroke, you pick, I think I like Waterlog.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.520]   It's a different idea 'cause it puts water,
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.960]   it's watercolor.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:09.240]   So you could have oil versus watercolor, maybe.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:11.360]   - Oil and water don't mix, man, don't even try.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:14.080]   - So the last 10 minutes have been very, very bad for me.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:16.080]   - It's cost me $7.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.480]   I now have Waterlog and Brushstroke.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.120]   - That's nothing, I just spent $1,800.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:21.960]   Why?
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:24.040]   Well, there's two things, it wasn't on the apps.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:27.160]   I spend more on the Shaquille.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.520]   First of all, Neil Young has been talking about Pono
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.440]   for some time.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:31.280]   - Oh yeah.
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.280]   - This is the idea that the music that we listen to
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:39.280]   on our iPods or iPhones is low quality AAC, highly compressed.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:43.560]   He said music is often recorded now
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:44.880]   at much higher bit rates.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.920]   He's wanted to make a Pono player for some time.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.760]   And unfortunately, I guess he wasn't able
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:55.240]   to raise the money, it's been much delayed.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:59.000]   So he has gone to Kickstarter to raise $800,000.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.800]   He's raised $284,000 so far.
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.040]   And I just had to support it because I love the idea
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:06.080]   of a player.
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:08.400]   - What happened in there?
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.400]   - We'll save that for the video for later.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.680]   Of a player that plays back the music,
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.280]   not highly compressed, but at the high quality
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.640]   it was recorded in, and we're not talking,
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.920]   you know, what is CD quality?
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:25.760]   44.1 kilohertz samples.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:26.600]   - Not very good.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:28.200]   - This is...
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:30.160]   - Well, 40...
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:33.960]   - The CD is 44.1 kilohertz 16-bit.
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:38.360]   Pono is 192 kilohertz 24-bit.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.760]   - So...
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.520]   - I don't think these are the same,
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.000]   those are the same measurements.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.480]   - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.320]   - Yes, they are.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.160]   - I'm not talking about it.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.000]   - I'm impressed.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   - I thought you were talking about MP3,
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:50.880]   which is even worse.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.240]   We're talking about uncompressed.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.080]   Pono uses flat.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.240]   - Pono does 192.24.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:56.640]   - It takes them from the masters,
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.160]   'cause when they record digital files in the studio,
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.120]   they're really not the higher quality.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:01.960]   - And I guess you get...
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:03.600]   - He says he can hear the difference.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.200]   - Oh no, you can definitely hear the difference.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.720]   - It's uncompressed.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.120]   Now admittedly, you're gonna have to have a hell
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.360]   of a lot of storage.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.240]   I got the Pono player in Chrome signed by,
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:16.160]   who did I get it by, Neil Young?
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.960]   You can get it Beck, you can get it Pearl Jam,
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:22.040]   Patty Smith, Tom Petty, Willie Nelson.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.320]   I got it signed by Neil Young, 'cause it's his idea,
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:25.320]   and I'm a Neil Young fan.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:26.480]   He's a Canadian Renee.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.800]   You should like him too.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:28.640]   - Absolutely.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:29.760]   - That's pretty, is that waterlog?
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.600]   - Yeah.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.440]   - Wow.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.200]   - Okay, so watercolor versus soil, I'd get both.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.040]   - Yeah.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.280]   - That's beautiful, that's your daughter?
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.120]   - Yes, my daughter, she was, that's her first time in the...
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:37.960]   - Oh, that's beautiful.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:38.800]   - Convertible, she was very excited.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:39.960]   - You can't really tell, would you tweet that?
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:40.800]   - Yeah, I'll tweet it.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.640]   - So that we can, people can see the original.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.520]   Anyway, I hope this goes through,
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:46.160]   I'm sure it will, I've already raised so much
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.040]   in just like a few hours.
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:49.240]   There's been a lot of interest in this.
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:51.680]   Admittedly, form factor sucks.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:52.880]   It's a triangle.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.240]   I hope it has enough storage.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:57.760]   I don't know what it says in terms of the storage.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.760]   $400 for, $300 or $400 for the first edition,
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:05.160]   if you want the signed edition, it's $400.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:08.520]   And it comes preloaded with the artist's top
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.120]   two favorite albums.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.000]   So you got Willing Nelson, Tom Petty,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.520]   Patty Smith, Pearl Jam, Beck, Crosby Stills in Nash,
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.200]   Crosby Stills in Nash and Young,
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.520]   Dave Matthew, Moo Matthews, Foo Fighters,
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:22.560]   Herbie Hancock, Nora Jones, Lenny Kravitz,
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:25.080]   you see Arcade Fire, a lot of artists.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.480]   And now for $5,000, you get a VIP dinner
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.760]   and listening party with Neil Young.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:33.680]   If I had the money, but see, unfortunately,
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.400]   I just spent a lot of money on this.
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.200]   It just came out, finally I've been waiting for it.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.440]   The little big disc, this is Thunderbolt 2.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.880]   - Dual round? - Yeah.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.760]   Dual SSDs, we speculate on how much
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:48.120]   that could cost for a terabyte, $1,299.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.040]   - Turns out a lot.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.680]   - Turns out it's very fast.
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.040]   - But it could have been more.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.400]   - Dual Thunderbolt 2 ports for daisy chaining.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:58.440]   It's got to-- - It's gonna homepage, Leo.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.440]   It could have been more.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.720]   - It could have been more.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.080]   Could have been more.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:02.920]   It's so cute.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.240]   - That's the marketing.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.120]   - Could have cost more.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.080]   - Could have cost more.
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.080]   - Could have cost more.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.320]   - And the idea is it's probably scary
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.720]   RAID 0, right, of dual SSDs.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.920]   - Is it dual SSD?
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.800]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:19.560]   Uses software, RAID for performance and data security.
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.400]   Yeah, right.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.140]   - What could possibly be the wrong
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:24.760]   for performance RAID 0 or you could do RAID 1?
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.800]   - Right, and it won't be quite as fast,
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:26.640]   but it'll be-- - But it'll be
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:27.480]   more redundant. - More redundant.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.480]   - And half the storage.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.920]   Or J-BOD, which is just capacity, right?
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:34.760]   - Yep.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:35.560]   - See and use each drive independently.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.860]   So it's nice that they give you the choice.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:40.780]   And it is full Thunderbolt 2, which is 20 gigs per second.
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.460]   20 gigabits per second.
[01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:43.580]   So I will give you a benchmark.
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:45.780]   I bought it, I didn't buy it for me.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:46.980]   - You bought it for you.
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:49.060]   - No, not for you, for you.
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:51.260]   The audience will give you a review as soon as it comes in.
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:52.100]   But it's finally out.
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:53.220]   I've been waiting for this for a while.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:55.140]   The Thunderbolt 2, a little bit of this.
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:57.860]   Anything else I can spend money on?
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:59.940]   - So many things.
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.780]   (laughing)
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:02.780]   I'm stopping now.
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:03.860]   I'm excited about Pono.
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:06.300]   I've really been waiting for this.
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:07.820]   You wanna get really good headphones
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:10.220]   or pump it into a really good system.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:11.060]   - Really good.
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:12.380]   - The idea of getting better quality--
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:13.500]   - Why don't you start going down this path?
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:14.860]   - Yeah, you're not gonna be able to use
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:15.700]   your little earbuds.
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:16.540]   - Oh no, no, no, no.
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:17.620]   This isn't your Bud.
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:20.780]   - You need the $1,000 headphones to go with.
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:23.460]   I really wanna listen to this.
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:27.660]   I don't know how much I would be able to appreciate
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:28.940]   that higher definition.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:31.300]   - Well, especially me, I'm 57 years old.
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:32.980]   I have no hearing left at all.
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:37.980]   But I just feel like I wanna support the idea that,
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:41.980]   kids today don't really listen to music anymore, right?
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:46.220]   They listen to this crap, compressed stuff.
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:48.660]   This is uncompressed flak.
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.660]   And it could be even, it plays actually
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:53.460]   as high resolution as the available master is,
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:56.340]   which means as well as high quality
[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:59.060]   is 192 kilohertz and 24-bit.
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.820]   - Next step up is live.
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:04.420]   - I just wonder how badly they could mess that up
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:06.020]   by saying that, well, if we're gonna let
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:09.180]   master quality studio recordings out into the public,
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.300]   we are gonna make it so hard to move that data
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.340]   from one place to another.
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:15.740]   - Well, that's a good point.
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:18.740]   I mean, I'm really curious to see how that works.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:19.740]   I'm not skeptical.
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.700]   I'm saying that my mind is filled with all the problems
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:25.820]   that have to be solved by the time you get,
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:27.380]   let's start listening to this really, really
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:29.660]   honey sweet music inside your head.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.140]   - Or the selection will be very limited.
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:34.420]   - It has two jacks, a stereo mini plug for headphones.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:35.540]   - There is a Foo fighter edition,
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:36.380]   so I'm on board with that.
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:38.380]   - I know you love the Foos.
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:42.100]   It also has a second jack that's a design for your home audio
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:43.740]   in your car with Sonos Connect,
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:45.380]   which I really like that idea.
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:49.420]   We'll see.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:52.340]   Again, I'm the guinea pig, so you don't have to be.
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:53.620]   - You tell us Leo.
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.620]   - I'll tell you.
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.380]   You can get, for 200 bucks,
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:58.060]   you can get the early bird special.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:00.180]   That's a pretty good price.
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:01.660]   - That sold out, isn't it?
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:02.780]   - All gone.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:03.620]   - Yeah.
[01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:06.700]   But list price is supposedly 500,
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:08.020]   and you still get it for--
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.660]   - 400 or 300, actually.
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:10.500]   - 300 or 300.
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:11.500]   - Yeah.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.260]   - See, the other thing that caught my attention
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:15.300]   is that every single piece of press information
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:16.580]   that's been released on this says that,
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:20.140]   "Oh, well, it's 128 gigs in El Store, over a thousand albums."
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:21.180]   - Mm, really?
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.020]   - Not really.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.660]   - That super, duper high quality?
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:25.700]   - Well, let's see, the super duper high quality,
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.140]   at the best quality, and by the way,
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.380]   it's only what the master did,
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:31.780]   so it depends what the master was,
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:35.540]   but that's 9,216 kilobits per second.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:40.060]   So what's that calculated out to?
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:40.900]   How many megabytes?
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.500]   - I'm not sure my head has that much bandwidth.
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.380]   (laughing)
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.220]   - That's why, I mean,
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:46.740]   that's why the hardware is gonna be expensive.
[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:48.220]   That's a lot of bandwidth, and you know--
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.220]   - It's big. - It's big.
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:51.060]   - Oh, I'm excited.
[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:54.380]   I'm hopeful, they say October, so you can do this.
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:55.220]   - You can really hear it,
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:56.860]   where you can really hear it, by the way.
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:58.580]   If you're listening to Metallica,
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:01.260]   you're not mostly gonna hear it,
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:02.580]   but in some areas, but--
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:07.340]   - Do not knock James Petfield, Lars,
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:09.180]   whatever his name is over, I've forgotten it.
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:11.300]   - The heavy stuff, it's ham,
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:13.700]   but the amazing guitar stylings.
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:14.700]   - I take it all back, I take it all back.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:18.420]   - So anyway, so the, where it's in songs
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.740]   where there's a lot of subtlety,
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:21.060]   is where you really can hear it.
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:23.420]   So if you hear, especially at the ends of songs,
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:27.820]   but also in strings, in things that are changing very subtly,
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.020]   you'll hear the bits when you--
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:34.460]   - And you wanna have an open sound that fills the space,
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:36.660]   I just, I believe there is a different--
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:38.460]   - Now you know you're gonna get some really good headphones.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:39.740]   - I have really good headphones.
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:44.740]   - Really, you gotta start thinking like $1,500 to $2,000.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:47.300]   To take full advantage of this, I'm just saying.
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:48.900]   - You gotta have the full pipe, Leo.
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:49.740]   - Yeah, once you go down the path--
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:50.900]   - I'm on this and I'm on my stereo.
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:51.740]   - This is the first time.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.540]   - This is the first time.
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:55.260]   - This is the first perfect Kickstarter project,
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:57.740]   where if you put it out in retail stores,
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:58.900]   it would just flop immediately,
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.140]   but the way to find the thousand people
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:03.340]   who really will support this, like Leo,
[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:04.740]   that's what Kickstarter is for.
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:06.140]   Not, not, not, not, I'm serious.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:09.100]   Like, the two, what I hate about Kickstarter,
[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:11.660]   tech project is that it's, no, you wanna sell
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:13.740]   kind of a half-assed version of your product
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.780]   to people who think that Kickstarter is an actual store,
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:19.460]   that's gonna sell them a real retail product.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:20.460]   Instead, you're basically--
[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:22.580]   - Very important to make that distinction.
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.420]   - Yeah.
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:25.580]   - Because I have many a thing that I've purchased
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:27.460]   on Kickstarter, but never seen.
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:28.300]   - Yes.
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.260]   - It is not a store, you are investing,
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:31.900]   and that's really what I consider I've just done.
[01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:33.140]   I really wanna support this idea.
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.540]   - Right, I think you have a great idea.
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:36.220]   I know it's not gonna happen unless people like me
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:38.060]   come forward, so I'm coming forward, here's my money.
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:39.460]   - Please, please, please, please, please,
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:41.220]   please make sure I get at least the t-shirt you probably speak.
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:43.180]   - And what's interesting is that the,
[01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:45.220]   the musicians who are behind this
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:47.060]   are very excited, obviously.
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:50.100]   And they do talk about risks and challenges.
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:52.340]   You obviously, you'll have to buy your music somewhere else.
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.580]   You can't get it at iTunes, it'll be,
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:56.300]   there's a POMO Music Store.
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:59.420]   I'm just, I'm excited about it.
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:00.860]   - Well, designed.
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:02.700]   No, you're in store, you have,
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:03.980]   working with your own hardware?
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:05.540]   - Yes, who would do that?
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.740]   - Well, well, I wish Apple had,
[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.900]   but they made a consumer product.
[01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:08.940]   This is clearly not.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:13.140]   Rob Trujillo, thank you, Glenn.
[01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:14.220]   - I have a higher time.
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:15.300]   - That's the most recent guy.
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.260]   I think Jason Newstead or maybe Cliff.
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:18.380]   You gotta go with Cliff.
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:21.500]   Hey, we're done.
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.500]   Can't be possible at one o'clock already.
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:25.700]   Alex Lindsey, so nice to see you.
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:26.740]   Have fun at Rwanda.
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:29.860]   You wanna give us a plug for your new Rwanda thing?
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:33.820]   - Yeah, it's, if you go to rowandaadma.com,
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:37.500]   there's the training Rwandans for the digital aid.
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:38.740]   And so we're, that's just,
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:40.580]   that's the little website that they put together
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:41.420]   at the school.
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:43.540]   - That's so, I'm so, I'm so, they didn't even tell me
[01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:45.380]   this morning I was like going through searching some stuff
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:46.420]   and I found it.
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:47.500]   So they, they put together on their own.
[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:48.860]   - They only had the good taste to use Squarespace.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:50.220]   - They did use Squarespace on that.
[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:53.940]   And you see some, a couple of the photos of our students.
[01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:55.580]   - This is such a neat idea.
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:56.420]   - Really excited.
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:59.500]   It's, I really love going down and visiting.
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.220]   So, so I'll be down there next week.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:03.540]   I'll be on Macbreak, but I'll be there.
[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:05.480]   There I am.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:10.480]   Anyway, so, you look good in a tie.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:14.000]   (laughing)
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.800]   - Well, you were with the Minister of Education.
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:16.800]   - Oh yeah, we're at Ty.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:17.840]   - Probably dress up a little bit.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:20.920]   So, so anyway, but anyway, and they're, you know,
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:21.760]   they're learning a lot.
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.920]   They're doing an amazing, amazing work.
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:26.320]   They're doing, they just streamed Miss Geek Rwanda,
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:29.160]   which is, so, which is, you know, we're one.
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.240]   - I wanna see that.
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:31.080]   - It's on YouTube.
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:31.920]   It's on YouTube.
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:32.760]   - Miss.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.600]   - Yeah.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.440]   - Rowanda.
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:37.840]   - Rowanda does an amazing amount of work
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.000]   in empowering women, specifically.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.400]   Over half the, over half their version of the Congress
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:48.400]   is women and so, anyway, so that's the,
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:50.520]   that's what we're doing.
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:51.960]   So, check it out.
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:54.280]   You search for Get Miss Geek, but Rwanda, you'll see it.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:55.120]   - Thank you, Alex.
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:56.200]   Have a great trip to Africa.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.480]   We'll see you back here soon, I hope.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.520]   - Yeah, I'm in Africa next week in London the week after,
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.800]   but I'll be on Macbreak both days.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.640]   - Oh, good.
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.040]   - You got bandwidth in both places.
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:04.040]   - Yep.
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:06.760]   Renee Ritchie, iMore.com is a place to go.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.080]   And of course, mobile nations, lots of great content.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:12.960]   They're a great, great place to go.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.880]   And @ReneeRitchie on the Twitter.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:16.720]   - Thanks, Renee.
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:17.760]   Good to have you.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:19.560]   Of course, Andy Inakos at the Chicago sometimes
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:21.800]   joins us each week for Macbreak Weekly as well.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.920]   Love the doggy painting.
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:28.000]   - Yeah, that's another one of those wow ones that it's,
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.720]   and I can't, and I'm not doing self-incurandized minutes.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.880]   It was an okay picture.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:35.480]   The frustrating thing about this app is that it will,
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.160]   wow, that was one of my favorite pictures,
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.080]   and now I think the original picture kind of stinks,
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:39.920]   and I really prefer it.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.920]   - It spoils you.
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:43.040]   - I'm downloading it, waterlog.
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.240]   Thanks for joining us everybody.

[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.920]   1800 UTC.

[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:15.200]   Better get back to work 'cause break time is over.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.040]   See ya later.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:21.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:26.360]   (upbeat music)
