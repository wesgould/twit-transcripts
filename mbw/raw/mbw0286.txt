[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.640]   that covers all your Cupertino needs joining us now,
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.240]   going from right to left, Mr. Andy Inaco of the Chicago
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.240]   Sun Times.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.600]   And the celestial waste of bandwidth at a lovely Valentine's.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.920]   It looks-- OK, don't say anything.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.840]   It's Maxfield Parish Meets.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.040]   Say hello to my little friend.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.560]   I don't know.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   Is it James Bond?
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.920]   What is it?
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.640]   This is the cover to "Electro Assassin #4" by Marvel Comics.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.600]   It's covered by the inestimable Bill Shinkevits.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.720]   This is the Electronachios you see in the red there.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.920]   With the person that she has held into mystical thrall
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.560]   and to assassinating the devil imbued candidate
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.000]   for the nomination for the president of the United States.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.920]   And also, you got cherubs and seraphims
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.680]   with the swords and guns.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.560]   It's great art said.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.560]   I love it.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.240]   I mean, really nothing says Valentine's Day, then bullet holes
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.520]   and a nice drummy on that equipment.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.640]   It does have a very Maxfield Parish kind of feel.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.960]   With Arnold and the Mayor's--
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.680]   Feel the heavy soil.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   You'll never be able to spell Shinkevits.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.160]   You're proving your geek credibility
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.240]   by even pronouncing Shinkevits correctly.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.720]   But if you do a Google search on Electra ELEKTA.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.840]   You'll find some really cool art by him.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.000]   Also here with us, as you've probably noticed
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.240]   for the first time in ages, Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.160]   It's good to have you back.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.000]   Welcome home.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.320]   It's good to be back.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.800]   You were traveling all over the world.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.080]   I mean, going from New York to Vegas to--
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.160]   I don't know, where else?
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.280]   I had a lot of trips.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.200]   I'm leaving on Thursday for London.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.880]   Oh my god.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.000]   And turns out I might have to go to--
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.360]   might have a stint in Italy next week.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.720]   We miss you when you're gone.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.760]   No, I'm going to try to log in from wherever I am next week.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.600]   Hopefully it'll be here.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.240]   Good.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.320]   Good.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.280]   Also with us, Mr. Mike Elgin, who
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.080]   is the man of the moment on Google+,
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.760]   Mike has written for many magazines.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.840]   He continues to write for Computer World and Time
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.600]   and others.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.720]   It's good to have you, Mike.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.560]   I've followed Mike's lead.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.840]   What you do, you went to Google+ as your blog.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.160]   Google+ is not my blog.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.120]   If you go to Elgin.com, it takes you right to Google+.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.000]   It was actually the last time you were on it
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.520]   is when I started thinking about it.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.200]   And then I just decided that that's the direction
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.680]   I was going to go after I saw what you were doing.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   And I love it.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.520]   I like Mike Elgin.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.560]   You're like your motto.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.240]   The world's only loveable tech technology writer.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.560]   For that company excluded.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.280]   That's very cute.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   Well, I'm not a writer, so I don't feel like I'm insulted by that.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.560]   Annie Inaco might be, though.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.840]   He's quite the writer.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.160]   Well, that's OK because I have documentation.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.760]   I actually have a postcard from a foreign land
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.040]   claiming that I am beloved in this person's home country.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.200]   So I claim international belovedness.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.280]   There you go.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.440]   So there's room for everyone.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.040]   There's loveable, and then there's beloved.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.680]   Which is higher.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.080]   I don't know.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.600]   I don't know which is the higher.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.720]   I'm three syllables of beloved, by the way.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.080]   From this is from our chatroom.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.840]   10 Reasons.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.520]   Twitter is sexier than Facebook.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.920]   I don't know.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.360]   This is Mike.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.280]   You're going to say, I just Google+, baby.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.960]   This is EuroRS CG's worldwide's annual Valentine's Day
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.560]   survey, the sex lives of social media users.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.360]   Oh, yeah, really.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.360]   Like they have sex?
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.120]   OK.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.880]   Does tweeting make you sexier?
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.960]   It asks.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.840]   Maybe so.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.800]   Ow.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.000]   40% Twitter users describe themselves as sexy versus 20%
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of Facebook users.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.720]   They are legends in their own mind.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.080]   What percentage of Twitter users are sexually adventurous?
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.240]   42%.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.640]   They are legends in their own mind
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.120]   versus only a third of Facebook users.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.000]   Skilled lovers?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.640]   How many Twitter users are skilled lovers?
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.560]   Says who?
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.320]   About a third of them.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.840]   Themselves.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.680]   Self-identified.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.440]   Self-identified.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.160]   Well, they would only give a very short amount of time.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.760]   I'm skilled.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.800]   Skilled but quick.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.240]   If I only could have one for the rest of my life, sex or romance,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.040]   that's a tough one.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.320]   I don't know.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.760]   I think Facebook's going to go towards romance.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.000]   Thank God we don't have to make that choice.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.200]   41% Twitter versus 33% sex.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.880]   67% on Facebook.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.840]   You're right because it's all the women on Facebook
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.560]   versus 59%.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.840]   There's something wrong there.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.640]   Oh, no, that adds up to 100% going sideways.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.120]   God, it's--
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.640]   Right, but Twitter users, those people are way too slim.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Really?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.520]   Sorry.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.800]   Sorry.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.880]   Or you're talking about something else.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.000]   How many Twitter users worry their sexual fantasies
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.400]   and behaviors, by the way, it's Valentine's Day
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.120]   as we record this.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.120]   Just so if you're wondering what the hell is Leo doing?
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.440]   Why are we talking about this?
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.200]   I had to acknowledge the day of love.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.920]   I got some handy.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.120]   Was St. Valentine the guy who expelled the snakes
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.240]   from Ireland?
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.120]   No, that was somebody else.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.640]   That was--
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.440]   What does St. Valentine do?
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.040]   He took a bunch of arrows or something.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.960]   What did St. Valentine do?
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.440]   You can see--
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.000]   How many now?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.480]   He tells you--
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.200]   He realized that you--
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.800]   He's a Wikipedia-ing it right now.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.920]   I can see you reaching over to your computer.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.320]   Either you or me, we're going to be--
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.080]   Yeah, I can do it.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.120]   Who's going to get there first?
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.640]   I'm here.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.600]   He's the name of several.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.920]   14 and all martyred saints of ancient Rome.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.440]   There were 14 valentines.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.320]   Turns out that was a bad name to have in Rome.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.960]   Wow.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.080]   Wow.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.120]   Did any of them die by arrow?
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.840]   Shh.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.520]   I don't know why we celebrate a day of love
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.440]   because it doesn't make-- OK.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.240]   Historian Jack O'Rook has made the case.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.000]   The traditions associated with Valentine's Day
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.640]   documented in Jeffrey Chaucer's parliament of fools
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.960]   and set in the fictional context of an old tradition
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.440]   has no tradition before Chaucer.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.640]   Chaucer invented Valentine's Day.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   Ah, no.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.160]   He invented it.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.280]   So never mind.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.760]   OK, going back to our much more important Twitter
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.320]   versus Facebook, what percentage of Twitter users
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.080]   worry their sexual fantasies and behaviors are normal?
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.160]   I'm not normal.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.200]   What do you want to guess?
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.880]   Nobody's guess.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.520]   80%.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.200]   21% of Twitter users versus 14%.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.120]   They got a horse in there.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.080]   That's a donkey.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.520]   Have had a romantic sexual or erotic relationship.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   What do you mean?
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.880]   Are not virgins?
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.320]   Is that what they're asking?
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.800]   27% of Twitter users apparently have-- what?
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.040]   There's something wrong here.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.200]   Only 20%.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.160]   Well, no wonder they think they're great lovers.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.080]   Only 20% of-- oh, online.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.200]   I missed the online.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.440]   OK.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.560]   27% Twitter users, 22% Facebook users.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.680]   I'm done with this.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.080]   Well, let's-- we'll stop now.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.680]   Although a tube CRT is a definite turnoff for me.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.960]   You got to be flat pound.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.560]   You're not turning on the tube, are you?
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.600]   Oh, my God.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.160]   So let us talk instead about the iPad 3.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.800]   That's what I'm going to have a love affair with.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.680]   The iPad 3.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.600]   Now, everybody from the Wall Street Journal on down
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.120]   is now saying March 7th will be the date.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.080]   I have no idea why they believe that.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.520]   But that's what they're saying.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.080]   Apple, of course, is not saying.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.640]   Mike Elkin, you have any inside dope?
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.600]   I have some dope, but it's not inside kidding.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.520]   You Twitter users, you-- oh, no, that's a Google+ joke.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.160]   That's right.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.640]   No, I think-- I have a theory.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.680]   I don't have any inside information.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.320]   But one observation is that the Wall Street Journal is
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.720]   pretty good with this stuff.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   They have a good track record of when they say,
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.040]   when they give a specific date, it's usually good information.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.480]   But I have a feeling that I think that the iPad 3 is going
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   to be a big play for FaceTime on the tablet, which
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.880]   is not a good experience on the current iPad
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.960]   because the display is not good, the front camera is not good,
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.440]   and the connectivity is not good.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.280]   And I think that I'm guessing that the iPad 3 will
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.600]   be George Jetson with nice display, nice camera.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.920]   It's cool.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.840]   Yeah, fast, fast connection.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.480]   The story originated-- all things D last week
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.520]   said it'll be the first week of March.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.600]   Wednesday is traditionally when Apple does these.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.000]   And Renee Ritchie writing in imore.com says,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.960]   according to sources who've been reliable in the past,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.040]   Apple currently plans to hold their announcement.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.360]   Wednesday, March 7.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.060]   Renee is saying that a retina display 2048 by 1536,
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.640]   quad-core A6 SOC, and LGE--
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.480]   no word about cameras.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.600]   But Mike, you would want a better camera on this, too,
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.000]   if you were going to improve the FaceTime experience.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.840]   Yeah, the camera is a surprising number of--
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.560]   AGA, right.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.080]   Yeah, especially-- I mean, the front camera is awful.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.840]   And imagine if the image that you saw when you're
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.120]   doing FaceTime on a tablet were super high quality.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.360]   And that would be amazing.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.520]   That would be completely different.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.840]   It would catch the Android tablet people off guard.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.120]   I think it'd be a really good selling point.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.000]   And you can imagine the commercials with the grandma
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.600]   and the baby and the dog and people interacting
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.640]   with each other over FaceTime.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.440]   It also helps Apple deal with the excitement over Google+
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.080]   Hangouts to the extent that that exists.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.160]   There's just-- I think that the FaceTime didn't do what
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.640]   they hoped it would do on the iPhone.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.800]   People kind of said, oh, that's cool.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.480]   And then stopped using it for the most part.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.680]   I mean, some people use it.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.480]   But I think Apple believes in FaceTime.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.960]   And I think they want to see it on tablets.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.760]   They need to do something.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.160]   The Kickstarter, I think.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.560]   I don't think they're particularly beating Hangouts
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.120]   or Skype.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.560]   My son requests it every time I'm gone.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.000]   He's like, why don't we FaceTime?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.840]   Why don't we FaceTime?
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.840]   Just so you know, FaceTime.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.340]   FaceTime.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.200]   He's the age-- well, four years old.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.400]   I think on the phone, it's hard also,
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.520]   because you have to hold the phone.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.800]   So I can imagine, I think, a tablet on a stand.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.960]   And then that becomes an interesting device.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   I think you're right.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.520]   I think it's very advertisingable, whether it's--
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.480]   and I think it could drive sales.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.320]   And do you agree, you think FaceTime--
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.360]   that this next iPad will be about FaceTime?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.080]   I'm not sure if it'll be all about FaceTime.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.120]   I think it's going to be mostly about improving
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.920]   the reading and the viewing experience.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.000]   Right now, we'll also do that, of course.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.480]   Excuse me?
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.120]   Right now, we'll also do that, of course.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.200]   Yeah, of course.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.840]   As far as the camera goes, they could hardly do anything,
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.760]   but improve the camera that's there.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.680]   Both the front and the rear-facing cameras,
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.280]   they're just-- they're barbed features.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.240]   Where you win the barbed by saying,
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.880]   see, we put a camera in the iPad.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.480]   It's not a good solution, but it is a camera.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.400]   I think that really, that was a differentiator
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.080]   that they decided to put into the iPad too,
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.160]   because while they got to do-- they got to start improving
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.720]   things.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.880]   Also, FaceTime, like you said, was
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.960]   going to be a much bigger deal a year ago, or a year and a half
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.080]   ago, when they started designing the iPad 2,
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.360]   or finalized the iPad 2, than it became.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.520]   They do need to do something to jumpstart FaceTime,
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.200]   but the fact that consumers aren't really jumping on board
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.240]   the FaceTime bandwagon indicates that this isn't a feature
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.840]   that Apple's customers find important right now.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.120]   So I think that usually that, to me,
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.920]   means that Apple's not going to really bust their guts,
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.800]   trying to figure out how to fix a problem for a feature
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.880]   that people aren't actually using.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.320]   But the retina display, you still get people who are saying
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.080]   that I love reading books.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.640]   I love viewing pictures.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.520]   I just wish that this display were easier to read.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.920]   They did put a better camera in all the notebooks.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.880]   The HD camera.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.360]   Still not that good.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.960]   I mean, the thing is--
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.600]   I mean, to a certain extent, it's a little bit like saying
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.280]   that it almost costs more money to put a CD drive rather than a DVD
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.560]   or drive into a notebook.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.840]   I mean, the prices of these components
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.520]   fall low at some point that are you really
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.080]   going to save $0.03 per component to have an inferior product?
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.000]   You may as well just upgrade it.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   If you compare it to something like the Logitech C910
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.520]   is, in my opinion, the best USB camera in existence now.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.800]   We bought like 30 of them and went through them all.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.120]   And it's by far the sharpest.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.280]   And once you've used that--
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.600]   This doesn't seem very sharp.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.000]   Well, that's the whole thing.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.640]   And once you've used the C910, you come back to this.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.880]   You almost don't want to turn it on anymore.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:09.800]   I think that the way Apple thinks is not
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.160]   that they see video conferencing out there
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.760]   and want to improve video conferencing.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.560]   They see a lot of excitement and activity
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.720]   around social networking.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.480]   So what do people do with social networking?
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.640]   Bunch of kids get together.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.240]   Bunch of people get together.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.880]   And they take a picture of themselves
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.600]   and they upload it to Facebook.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   I mean, this happens--
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.440]   Huge.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:28.880]   That's huge.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.400]   A hundred thousand times an hour.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.680]   I mean, and Apple has no answer to that,
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.560]   to no way to hijack that behavior, that impulse, to share,
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.200]   look at us, this is what we're doing right now, kind of thing.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.560]   And my guess is that Apple can use FaceTime
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.000]   to replace that behavior, not to do the same thing.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.200]   But if you have a tablet, that means
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.440]   that multiple people can view it, view a FaceTime.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.200]   A phone is kind of like one person doing FaceTime.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.520]   A tablet turns it into a group FaceTiming with another group.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.200]   And I can see them wanting to hijack that behavior.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.520]   What I don't see yet is whether the carriers can handle it.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:06.880]   Right.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.680]   And also, I think that what makes a lot of those video conferencing
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.920]   pieces compelling, in my opinion, is stuff like--
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.320]   what makes Hangout so compelling is
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.880]   is that you have a bunch of people.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.240]   It's not just a two-way communication.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.720]   And I was talking to an engineer in an airport
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.000]   that said that his daughter is giving up Facebook
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.160]   because she's on a-- her and her friends just turn on Hangouts
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.560]   and leave them on for all evenings.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.040]   That's what my kids do, too.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.280]   He'll do his homework with us.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.640]   But they do it with Skype, I think.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.040]   But they'll have the chat running at all times.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.240]   And Hangouts, good because you get nine people, right?
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.800]   You'll see a bunch of windows in there walking.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.440]   And some of them are coming and going.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.120]   They'll be all coming and going in and out.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.280]   It's like a room that they kind of come into and hang out
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:44.960]   with these different things.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.920]   And I went out a couple of days ago, I said,
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.120]   what do I want most in-- and I think maybe after I
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.320]   thought about it, it wasn't the right thing to say.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.400]   But I said, I want a better camera in the iPad.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.680]   And I was thinking, because of Avid Studio,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.760]   I thought a great video camera in that thing.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.800]   But then I thought about it.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.000]   And a lot of people said, are you kidding?
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.800]   You want a retina display.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.800]   You don't want a better camera.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   Who's going to hold?
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.840]   You see a lot of people taking pictures of the iPad.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   But I think Mike, you hit the nail on the head.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.960]   It's not the-- yes, a better back-facing camera.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.480]   And we're hearing Eiland said five to eight megapixels,
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.680]   probably something comparable to an iPhone 4.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.120]   But a better front-facing camera puts the iPad in party mode.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.080]   Well, yeah, it makes it a party mode device.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.840]   But FaceTime is one-on-one.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.400]   Do you think they would add, then?
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:27.960]   Isn't it?
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.080]   You can't do conferencing.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.160]   Oh, you can pay to have multiple users on Skype.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.120]   And FaceTime is only one-on-one.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.360]   And I think they're going to change that.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.760]   I think Hangouts is demonstrated.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.000]   Maybe that's what a co-announcement is, a better camera
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.240]   and a Hangout style interface.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.840]   They do it in my chat.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.600]   Why couldn't it?
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.720]   And if you had a quad core chip--
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.560]   And now, here's another question.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.960]   Do they make it work with 4G?
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.400]   Now, it doesn't work with 3G.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.200]   I think they will.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.000]   I think that it's-- especially if you
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.440]   want to a higher resolution and being able to stream that stuff,
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.480]   I think you need to have LTE as part of that.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.720]   It certainly sells LTE.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.200]   I'm not sure if they do that.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.320]   Remember, the bottleneck for LTE is not only the cell towers,
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:15.280]   but also every single carrier is putting just--
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.040]   this sort of caps on LTE that makes it almost impossible
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   to really use effectively.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.400]   It really does punish you for not seeking out
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.240]   a Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.520]   And if you're at home, you're probably on Wi-Fi.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.400]   But Apple has never listened to carriers, have they?
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.840]   Do they really care what Verizon and AT&T say?
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.240]   Well, they would care about the blowback.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   I mean, it really is all about the user experience.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.880]   And that's true.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.880]   I really do think they're the sort of company--
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.840]   they're not the Google sort of company that would sort of
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.560]   allow people to make their own mistakes that way.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.320]   I think they're the company that would say,
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.160]   if we enable 4G usage of HD FaceTime,
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.880]   then people are going to be blowing past their 2GB caps.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.200]   They're going to be very unhappy with it.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.240]   They're going to have reduced bandwidth.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.680]   It's much simpler for us to simply say, I'm sorry,
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.440]   for HD mode, you do require a Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.200]   What I find interesting is that if I
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.760]   call someone on Facebook and it gets--
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.920]   I mean, a FaceTime, it'll use the Wi-Fi.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.640]   But what I really want to do is call other iPhone users
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.360]   with the Wi-Fi.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.200]   Just dial it.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.840]   And then it won't do that, right?
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.320]   It just uses the regular cell.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.800]   And my whole thing is, if I want a Wi-Fi and they're
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.480]   on a Wi-Fi, I just want to know that if I dial the number,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.520]   it's just going to automatically reroute the same way
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.000]   that it rerouts my messages, the same way it rerouts my FaceTime.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.600]   And I don't want to turn FaceTime on and then turn it off.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.200]   I just want to dial the number.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.640]   And if it sees, oh, that's another iPhone,
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.080]   I'm just going to connect you directly.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.840]   And that makes a big difference when I'm overseas.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.920]   I'm going to make a ruling.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:52.320]   I'm going to say you're right, it won't be FaceTime on 3 or 4G.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.800]   That's my ruling.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.560]   Moving on.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.800]   They will have to make it thicker if they put a better camera
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.240]   in or not.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.640]   That's not a better battery.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.560]   Well, they--
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.400]   A battery, it'll be thicker because of the battery.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.360]   Yeah, I think they'll put a better--
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.400]   heavier battery in there, right?
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.640]   I do think that also combined with what we saw with iBooks
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.320]   author, A Retina Display makes a lot of sense on an iPad.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.360]   Well, and we're seeing a lot of evidence
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.560]   because we're seeing double and quad resolution icons.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   There are tools in the textbook editor for--
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.360]   It seems to me that there's a lot of evidence.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.760]   The textbook is really compelling at that resolution.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   You know, they must--
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.400]   They almost need it, don't you?
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.320]   I've been doing a lot of testing--
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.000]   we've been designing iBooks that we're
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.560]   going to be putting out on the iTunes store
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.880]   in the next couple of weeks.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:41.720]   And it's a struggle to fit into the 1024 by 768 palette.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.040]   It'd be really nice to have twice that much space.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.080]   I still think so.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.960]   If you had a good HD video camera--
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.040]   On the front, absolutely.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.000]   Not just on the front, on the back.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.080]   And--
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.920]   I-- I-- movie maybe.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.600]   But I have it-- I have it's studios when I--
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.680]   I think I would use it.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.680]   Admittedly, it's not-- it's ungainly.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.280]   But on the other hand, you're getting a great view
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.120]   of what you're seeing.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.760]   Who needs a video tap?
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.400]   I'm seeing what I'm saying.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.560]   I'm surprised by how many people I see in the field actually
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.920]   using tablets for shooting video, not just the iPad.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.360]   But I had a double Loch Ness Monster sighting
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.320]   last week in Copley Square.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.840]   Someone was shooting video with a tablet.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.680]   And the tablet was a Blackberry playbook.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.080]   Oh, no, that's just weird.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.840]   I actually saw some-- it was just the fact that--
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.000]   I didn't-- why is this guy holding up their Kindle?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.520]   Am I seeing someone like testing out the next version
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.680]   of the camera like, oh my god, it's a playbook.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.240]   Oh my god.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.760]   It's a playbook.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.720]   So it doesn't make much sense to shoot pictures.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.880]   Matthew Brady style.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.240]   You have this huge 8 by 10 sheet of glass.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.000]   But people will do that.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.200]   And you're exactly right.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.120]   There's so many really good movie editing apps
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.440]   that if you really are in the mode of you're
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.000]   using your iPad as a primary device and not just
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.280]   a portable content thing, that is a really cool thing.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.400]   And they can hardly do worse than the camera they have right
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:55.920]   now.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.960]   I think it would almost cost them less money
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.240]   to put a better front-facing--
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.000]   better upgrade both the cameras on that device.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.200]   By the way, Blackberry has not given up yet.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.400]   Byron's telling me in the chat room
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.000]   that they gave away playbooks on Ellen yesterday.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.840]   Everybody in the audience got a playbook on Ellen.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.440]   How does she justify this?
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.200]   Hey, here's the tablet nobody wants.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.920]   But you got one.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.040]   How do you like--
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.200]   It's big enough for two Twinkies and the beverage.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.960]   We have--
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.000]   That's a great one.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.360]   I bought a playbook.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.760]   I did buy a playbook when it came out.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.320]   And it's around here somewhere.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:26.720]   I have to mix.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.480]   Burke's been using it quite a bit now.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.640]   Burke gets all my old stuff.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.560]   He also has the 10-inch Dell Windows machine
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.600]   that I bought some time ago.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.680]   I buy stuff that's really bad.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.280]   And then I give it to Burke and he loves it.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.800]   Well, he's been using it to test audio.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.840]   He says it's been satisfactory.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.440]   There's actually some great things in the playbook.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.960]   And RIM has said they're going to put email out
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.280]   on the next edition.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.160]   A lot of the mistakes they made on the playbook
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.640]   they're going to fix.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.400]   So you know what?
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.680]   Playbook may not be dead yet.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.360]   Just like the storm.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.680]   The what?
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.840]   A storm?
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.000]   I got said that.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.520]   I got the--
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.560]   That was horrible.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.880]   Someone said I had to do a thing with the storm.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.160]   And it was the most horrible piece of it.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.240]   Well, that was the one because they're
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.760]   trying to make it clickable.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.760]   But it had a full--
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.760]   But it wasn't.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.760]   You pushed it.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.760]   It was like, really?
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.120]   You tweet Ellen answers.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.520]   Ellen took to Twitter again to answer her followers,
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.800]   urgent questions.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.960]   This time she had a huge surprise for everyone.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.440]   A BlackBerry playbook.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.400]   How much do you think BlackBerry paid?
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.960]   It's not like, oh, we'll send you some to give away.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   It's like--
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   Yeah, I'm going to pay a million dollars.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.160]   --tapes underneath a $50 bill.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.760]   So you'll cheer.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.680]   You know what it is?
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.280]   They hand it on playbook when they walked off stage
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   and hear heaven I've had.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.160]   I really wonder what the audience thought.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   Like, a playbook.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   OK.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   OK.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.160]   Huh.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.480]   Well, it's an expensive piece of hardware.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   And I don't think--
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.920]   Nobody's going to turn it down.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.160]   Yeah, the type of people who would go to an Ellen audience
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.960]   and sit in the audience, these aren't the Andy
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   and notcos of the world.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.560]   These are-- you know what I mean?
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.040]   They're not going to be very savvy about what the best
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   tablet is.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.120]   I like Ellen.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.120]   I love Ellen.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.120]   She's just great.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.120]   How are you?
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.120]   Good.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.120]   Good.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.120]   I like this segment because the people--
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.920]   Notice that she called it "Twit."
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.120]   I'm going to have to sue.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.680]   All right, that's enough of that.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.560]   Ellen, if you pull this video, our video down,
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.400]   for infringement of your rights, I'm pulling your video down
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.520]   for infringement of our rights.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.960]   How about that?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.440]   Does Google have a DMCA takedown for infringement
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.240]   of the "Twit" trademark?
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.920]   They want to answer and hear some fuzz.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.320]   And then I answer them in the "Twit"s and ask.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.320]   And what happened with that?
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.320]   Holy shit.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   Where's your computer?
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.320]   I'm using my new Blackberry Playbook.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.920]   It's a tablet that lets you run multiple apps at the same time.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.920]   Multiple apps.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.920]   Multiple apps.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   You can do a lot of stuff on it.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.920]   Really?
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.920]   Yes.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.920]   It's so dirty and little.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.920]   Like you're short.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.120]   Don't they have to say whether it's an ad like that?
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.120]   Like say, this is an ad.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.120]   Blackberry's played promotional--
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.920]   I don't have to say that.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.920]   That's a very pretty--
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   Maybe at the end.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   They didn't do that.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   They didn't do that.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.920]   They didn't do that.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   But you see how--
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.520]   Is the surrogate for the audience?
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.120]   And it acts like she never even heard of it.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.120]   Right.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.120]   It's shorter because maybe she's short.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.120]   She might be literally sitting up there going, what is this?
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.520]   Yeah, it's not an iPad.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520]   Why don't we have iPads?
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.920]   Someone probably told her right before she walked on stage.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   All right.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.920]   And can we still do the same thing?
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.920]   I can answer the questions for people.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.920]   Okay.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   What do the people want to know?
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   First question, Corey's reviews.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.920]   How's your back doing?
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.920]   Oh, Corey's reviews.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.920]   Thank you for asking.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   My back was very bad last week.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   I'm going to skip ahead to where she--
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   Because I don't really don't care about it back.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.920]   But I do want to skip ahead to where they--
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.920]   I think I'm about two.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   About four hundred and ten.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.920]   And they go crazy.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   Yes.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   Now, I want to hear the promotional consideration.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   Brought you by Best Buy and Blackberry.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.920]   Wow.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   We found these in the trash.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.920]   Wow.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.920]   Wow.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.920]   Word-winning giant domino toner.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.920]   You get a playbook.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.920]   Kisses the Blackberry, a playbook brought to you by RIM, a smaller device than the iPad
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   II that gives you all the features.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920]   Except email.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.920]   It doesn't really work, but it's free.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   Well, disappointed in the other thing.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.920]   The other thing is that that children, audience, it will have heard of Blackberry.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.920]   They will have heard of Blackberry.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   And so that's a good brand.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.920]   And notice--
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.920]   Blackberry is a great brand.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920]   Notice the elevator pitch.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.920]   Because the guy gave the obviously advertising line when he says, "It runs so
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   many applications at once."
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   Whew.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.920]   So it's unlike the Commodore 64.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.920]   You're talking about it.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920]   Not like DOS.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   It will run more than one application at this time.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920]   My Apple II.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.920]   It's stuck.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   Not only that, it will run every application made for the playbook at the same time.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   There's enough memory to run every application ever written.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   All right.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   We shouldn't mock the poor playbook.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   But you do raise an OK point there.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.920]   I'm not sure that there aren't consumers out there who don't really care about iPad,
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   Blackberry, Amazon Kindle.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.920]   They care about the features more than anything else.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   And so that if you have a $200 tablet like the Kindle, the fact that it's not the G-Wiz
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   Bang tablet that the iPad is doesn't really matter to them.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   They can still watch movies on it.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   They can still read books on it.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   They can still surf the web on it.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.920]   And that's perfectly OK for them.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   But I got to have an iPad 3 with retina display and octa core processor and
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.920]   a hoverboard functionality.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.920]   But sometimes these consumers, they just want to read books.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   They just want to watch movies.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   And they want to get out of there for a lesson to our books.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   But I got to think that if Ellen said, and you've all just won an iPad 2, the screams
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   would have just smidged better.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.920]   We recognize that logo on the back.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   Yes.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   I think that might have been just a little more excitement.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   So do you agree that it will be a quad core A6?
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   I don't know about the CPU.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   I think that Apple is going to focus on the performance rather on the being able to say,
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   oh, well, this is a quad core processor.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.920]   As always, when advice like this, it's all about power consumption.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.920]   And if you've got X amount of square inches to put into processing power, do you really
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.920]   want to put all that power into multiple processors?
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   Or do you want to just do it by improving the architecture of the current CPU and
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.920]   adding some really good GPU to the side of it to get the performance that you really,
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   really want if it really is a retina display.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   And one of the points of this device really is to get 1080 HD.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   Man, they don't really, they're not going to really care about how fast it will recalculate
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920]   a spreadsheet.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   They're going to care about having not one drop play frame when they're playing HD video
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   on this thing.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   It's going to be fast.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   I think that's what we can.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.920]   It's going to be faster than that.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.920]   And you're, I think that while we care about quad core, we know it an A6 system on a chip
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   is nobody, nobody sells stuff that way anymore.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.920]   People are just going to say does it react when I touch it?
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.920]   Right.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   You know, and you, if you have that many more pixels, you kind of need more processing.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920]   Right.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.920]   I mean, that's not, that's not going to be four times as much.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.920]   But it's not necessarily let's have a general use sevenfold increase in overall processing.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.920]   It could be just that we really want to use that power and that square footage inside
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   the case just specifically to increase our pipe for a free HD playback.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.920]   By the way, the rumors disagree on this, uh, a six nine to five.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   Max says they found code references to quad core, but the verge says we hear otherwise.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   So this will be good.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   We'll see who's right.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   Um, you think March 7th?
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   That makes that's credible.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.920]   If it's March 7th, what is the ship date?
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   March 14th?
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.920]   It's going to be summer probably.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.920]   Really?
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.920]   Yes.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.920]   I didn't do that last year.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   Last year they announced it what?
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.920]   Uh, in February and it came out, I remember it came out when we were at South by Southwest.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.920]   They did the pop up store in Austin.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   Yeah, but they then again, they didn't need it.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.920]   If this is LTE, they're going to need a new radio.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.920]   So that's a brand new FCC.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.920]   Okay.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.920]   Okay.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.920]   So there you go.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.920]   June 20th.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   June 29th.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   That's what I'm going to get.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.920]   I'm going to be bummed if it's not available pretty quick.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.920]   It could be March 9th.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.920]   March 9th is the Friday.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   They could just go crazy.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.920]   I don't see.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   I don't think they would do that.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   I think that the soonest we would see it is about two and a half weeks after that event.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.920]   Because I just think from a logistical point of view, they're going to invite a couple
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.720]   of hundred members of the press for the unveiling.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.640]   And then 10 of those will be ushered into a hotel suite nearby.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.320]   Sign up, pile of documents and walk out of there with a backpack with a Microsoft logo on it
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.120]   that they're not allowed to talk about.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.920]   That's why I'm having a Walt Mossberg costume and mask manufactured.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.520]   Are you doing like mission and possible style?
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.920]   Where it just pees out exactly.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.920]   And then at the end, I'll rip off the mask.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.920]   I, you know, that actually makes a lot of sense, Andy.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.920]   And the original iPad shipped on April 3rd, if I recall.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.920]   That's right.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.920]   And it was an at-word announcement in January.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:57.720]   But so first week of April, you know, announce it first week of end of the first week of March
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.920]   and then ship them three weeks later that that's conceivable.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.280]   I got mine two and a half weeks before.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:12.320]   And that was, it wasn't, it wasn't a cloak and dagger, but they decided that a couple
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.400]   of weeks, two and a half, about two weeks before the actual release was ample time to
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.160]   get an advanced thing in it.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:24.640]   So I'd be surprised if they would try to send PR, send marketing teams and executives
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.560]   all across the country for like two different or three different briefings for to cover
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.880]   the people they would have to see before the, at least the iPad three.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.280]   So I would, I would be surprised if they released it on March 7th or very shortly after it.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.760]   I wouldn't be surprised if, as you say, the actual release date was going to be a couple
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.280]   of months later, but I really think that we'll be talking about release sometime at the end
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.120]   of March or late April.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.560]   I'm convinced Wall Street Journal says, I should say, I was going to say earlier, I'm
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.400]   sorry, credit for credit stew.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.880]   Jim Daller Rumpel at the, at the loop is backing the March 7th date.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:06.000]   And Jim is one of those names where if he unequivocally backs up a rumor that, okay,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.640]   I gotta work on the assumption that this is absolutely true.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.920]   >> He's backing the Renee rumor.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.400]   He's saying yes, Renee Renee.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.960]   So he's, you're vouching for him and he's vouching for Renee.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.160]   >> So there, but it's multiple pieces of a puzzle.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.200]   He's not like just simply saying, ooh, I read this in this pool.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.600]   I would have to guess based on his reputation that he also knows some stuff and this syncs
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.760]   up and the stuff that he's heard.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:36.320]   Unfortunately, he has, he has, he has much better inside, inside knowledge than I do
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.600]   about things, things that are related to scheduling and unannounced products like that.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.440]   So I've never been burned by Jim in the past.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.280]   So that's, he's a, he's a really good source.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.440]   >> Well, I had journals.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.040]   >> I'm sorry, really good, really good opinion.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.040]   >> Opinion.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.040]   >> A bot source.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.040]   >> Another source.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.040]   >> Exactly.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.080]   >> So we'll add the journal to, they're in the column first week of March.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.840]   They're also in the column there will be LTE.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   They say they don't know and other carriers aren't talking about AT&T and Sprint, but
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.560]   they say 4G on Verizon.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.120]   And you know, part of that is because I think Verizon announced, or at CES of Verizon, Vice
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.320]   President said, we're not going to take any more non LTE devices.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.440]   So that would be, that would be an indicator.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:22.360]   Brooke Cruthers writing in the circuits blog at CNET says, quad core, not so fast.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:30.400]   TI, which is an ARM processor supplier, says they're not going quad core.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.600]   So I don't know, I mean, Apple makes its own, you know, they use ARM, but they make their
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   own chips.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.480]   So what TI does is probably not germane Qualcomm.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.040]   >> I think obviously all they're going to worry about is making sure that it's a lot faster
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.040]   or feels more responsible.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   >> I think you're right.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:50.160]   >> Or even as responsive on a Retina display, I think will be probably satisfactory.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.920]   Gus Richards, who's an analyst for Piper Jeffers, says they're going to beef up the graphics,
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.800]   which won't leave room for another two CPUs graphics.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.000]   GPU upgrade may be a better improvement.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.920]   >> What you have to do to get that much.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:11.240]   >> Of a non-text says it seems very unlikely if people are thinking quad core.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:17.320]   Having four A9s, that's a Tegra 3, is not the right move.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.920]   He says single threaded performance does a lot of room to improve, improving that doesn't
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.480]   mean going with more of the same cores.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:30.840]   It's kind of very similar actually to the state of the art in processors for desktops,
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.440]   where Intel didn't go quad core until they had maxed out the clock speeds on the single
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.440]   cores.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.440]   >> Right.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.440]   >> That's right, Mike, isn't it?
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:46.120]   >> Yeah, I mean, the whole thing, I mean, I have no solid opinion on this, but the whole
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:53.560]   thing smacks of the kind of thing that the Android hardware makers would do.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.560]   It sounds, I don't, Android would do it before Apple would do it.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:03.880]   >> Yeah, I think they'll find a way that has always been the case with iPads of having
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:10.400]   incredible performance and also having great battery life without just throwing massive
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.640]   quantities of raw hardware out of it.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.080]   I just, I don't know, it just doesn't seem like the kind of leap they'd make.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:22.440]   >> And here's another link from the Wall Street Journal, Apple and Suppliers test tablet with
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.000]   smaller screen.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.440]   We're talking eight inch screens.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.080]   >> I would be more tempted to get an 8 inch screen than the iPad 3.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:39.360]   >> I just find that the iPad is just a little too large to put in my, in my, it's kind of
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   just.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:45.000]   >> Is the 8 inch screen enough of a change to really make a material difference?
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.640]   >> Well, here's why, yeah, here's why I think they'll do it.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:54.840]   If you look at the, if you look at the profit in the, in the smartphone market and the tablet
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.760]   market, the profit, that's the business.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.600]   That's why companies exist to make profit ultimately.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:08.280]   All of the profit is between the iPhone and the iPad outside the iOS universe.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.000]   So for example, the Amazon Kindle Fire is succeeding.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.200]   Presumably they're going to make a lot of money on it, not from the hardware, but from
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   their whole proposition.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.640]   >> It's seven inches.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.640]   >> Right.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.640]   >> It's seven inches.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.880]   The, you know, Samsung is the only other profitable company really worth noting.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.800]   I mean, 95% of the profits in the, in the cell phone market came from just two companies
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.440]   and 80% of that was Apple.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:36.240]   15% of the profits were from Samsung and Samsung is really going to move everybody to
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.600]   that, that Galaxy Note of yours.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   >> I love it.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.680]   I am, I am, I have, I was sold.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.480]   I thought this is too big.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.920]   And after using it for two weeks, I am completely sold on it.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.920]   >> So I think that from six months a year from now, all of the profits outside the iOS
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.440]   universe are going to be in devices that are in between those two.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.600]   And, and so really, Apple.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.840]   >> Do you think phones will all be four and five inches and then there'll be seven inch
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   tablets?
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.240]   >> I think, I think 95% of the phones will be roughly the size of the iPhone.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.560]   But I think Samsung will, you know, I think Samsung will actually grow the, their ability
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   to be profitable.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.480]   And I think it, you know, at least half of those are, you know, making these numbers
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.480]   up.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.800]   But I think a lot of those are going to be Galaxy Notes.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.080]   That's a compelling form factor.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:30.920]   It's a compelling, it's a, it's a rare, clear differentiator from the iPhone at this point.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.640]   And I think people are going to be gobbling them up.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.080]   And I think they're going to be profitable for Samsung.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.040]   And so, you know, there's a sweet spot in there somewhere, you know, between tablets
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.560]   and between the iPhone and the, and the, and the iPad.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.520]   And there's a third reason.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:52.960]   Now, Andy was, was talking about how you need the big resolution screen for, for eBooks.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:57.520]   But when they announced that did the whole education market thing, I did a live hangout
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.480]   during the thing with educators.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.680]   I had people who were responsible for huge rollouts in school districts all over the
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   country who are teachers who have iPads.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.640]   There's, there's kids have iPads.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.320]   And they brought up something that none of the tech people are talking about.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.240]   All of the educators agreed that there are two problems with the iPad as an education
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.240]   device.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.480]   Number one, yeah, the rich school districts in Oregon do great with that.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.040]   But there aren't very many of those school districts who are willing to pay, spend $500
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.240]   per pupil just for the hardware before they start buying textbooks.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.760]   The second thing, which I've had never heard anybody else said, in which all of these
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:40.800]   educators were very adamant about is you can't send a little kid out the front door of the
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:47.360]   schoolhouse with a $500 piece of consumer electronics that everybody wants to steal.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.480]   And so I really think that the sweet spot for the K through 12 education market is going
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:58.120]   to be a cheaper device, $200 device from Apple.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.840]   I think that I think their education system isn't going to work unless they can do this
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.200]   broad based rollout of hardware.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.320]   And I think the only way to really have a less expensive device is to have a smaller
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.480]   device.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.800]   So I really think that an eight inch, seven inch, seven point something inch device is
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.640]   going to be necessary for Apple to really go mainstream with education.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:24.280]   Well, I don't think I agree with that for two different, two different very separate
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   reasons.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:30.720]   First of all, to address the educational element of that, that's a very, that is a very fine
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   point.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.600]   But the most expensive component in a tablet like that is the display.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.200]   So if Apple simply said we're going to make, we're going to keep the sub retiniscale display
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:44.440]   and make that the our price busting price point, that's going to be our $299 iPad.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.400]   We will keep a 10 inch pad that uses a cheaper display.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.320]   That might solve that problem a little bit.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.520]   But the most, the thing that the, I won't say that I know for a fact that Apple will
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.720]   not make a smaller version of the iPad.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:02.200]   I'm sure that they're playing with that partly because these higher resolution displays make
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.880]   a lower resolution, excuse me, a smaller screen, a little bit more practical, at least it'll
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.240]   still be more readable.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.360]   But the thing is that Apple, I think only does things because they see a real need for
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.920]   it or a real market for it.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.600]   Right now, there's still, the consumers out there are not telling Apple we demand a smaller
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   iPad.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.160]   There's still selling iPads hand over foot as fast as they can possibly make them.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.040]   So there doesn't seem to be like they're leaving money off on the table right now by
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.520]   having just a 10 inch display.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:36.720]   Then now we have an example of, well, how about a successful seven inch tablet in the
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.080]   form of the $199 Kindle fire?
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.000]   Now Apple has had some time to look at the numbers coming in from at least the holiday
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.960]   quarter last year about how Kindle fire sales affected the sales of the iPad.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.840]   And Tim Cook already said that we have looked at those numbers and we don't see any examples
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.680]   of the Kindle fire cannibalizing iPad sales.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.640]   So that's another, so they don't, I don't feel as though right now they're feeling any
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.560]   pressure from the makers of smaller form factor tablets right now.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.920]   I think that they are convinced that the people who are buying the seven inch tablets
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.000]   are people that they weren't going to sell 10 inch tablets.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.600]   Anyway, that they're just, they can't create a compelling product for the consumers of
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.680]   the Kindle fire and those kind of tablets.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.800]   So they're going to continue to look at this.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.640]   I think they're continuing to build iPads of various size and actually put them out in
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.960]   the field with executives to see how well it works in the field.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.280]   I don't see though that Apple currently has any pressure to actually produce that kind
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.400]   of a tablet.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.760]   And we won't really see any new pressure until maybe the end of this year, beginning
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   of next year.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.560]   Your point really is that Apple tests stuff all the time.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.640]   It's meaningless to say Apple's testing a smaller tablet.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.800]   Not only exactly, they test stuff all the time, but also that I need to see a reason
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:50.120]   why either Apple's leaving money on the table or they're getting too much competition for
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.520]   other people to get that.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.920]   Those are the two reasons or one of those two reasons would compel them to make a seven
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.520]   inch or an eight inch iPad.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.440]   Right now I don't see that they're feeling any pressure from either of those things.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.800]   They're not going to do it just because, hey, Jesus Christ, Samsung is selling a bunch
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   of seven inch tablets.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.720]   Amazon is selling a bunch of seven inch tablets.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.400]   You don't want to be the only losers out there who don't have a seven inch tablet.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:15.040]   But I think the only thing I'll say is that there's a lot of oxygen between $200 and $500.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.960]   And it seems compelling to me for Apple's sake, a $299 lower resolution tablet is going
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.960]   to be Apple's solution.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.320]   I think they're, I think that their solution to that, if I'm going to guess is going to
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:31.600]   be let's keep the iPad two as an existing skew and lower the price of that down to 100,
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:36.400]   no spot to, oh, idiot, I was going to say $199 because that number is on my mind.
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.400]   Because that would be awesome.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   I think that would be awesome.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.400]   I think that would be awesome.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.960]   That would be, that would be how, if you want to see the best way to for them to spend
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   all their billions of dollars, have a lost leader iPad just to kill every, not just every
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.760]   other competing, competing tablet, but kill the hopes and dreams and futures of every
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.720]   executive at every other company.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.720]   That's what we call anti-trust.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.120]   But if they got the, but also for the, I think that would be good enough.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.640]   I think it's also a way to respond to schools and you know, you've got this textbook thing.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.520]   You need a low, you need a low cost one so that schools can buy in.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.120]   And I tell you what, it's worth selling it at a loss.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.400]   I mean, to get millions of kids in middle schools and high schools hooked on the iPad.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.680]   Well, and I think it's, and I think that it's worth it.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.880]   And I think it's, and I think it's, and I think it's, it's, it's, it's, I mean, Andy,
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.640]   Andy, your, your analysis is spot on, but it, but right now Apple's only talking about
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.480]   hardware content is the business in the long term.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.560]   And they want to get, you know, they, the, the, I don't, I just don't see Apple seeding
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.440]   that market to Amazon.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.960]   Just say, okay, you know, you're, you're, you're competing with iTunes.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.160]   You're competing with the, the movies you're, you're offering TV shows.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.960]   You have a better app store than, than, than the Android marketplace.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.320]   And, and go for it.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.360]   You know, it's all yours.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:03.640]   I just don't, I don't see Apple just leaving, you know, letting Amazon just come into its
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.240]   space and making gazillion dollars on content.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.480]   If in fact they are able to do that.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.200]   That's, I don't think, I think that it, I don't think they see it as a competition.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   Really.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.480]   I think that their sales pitch when they're in the meeting with the, with the bulk buyer
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:22.600]   in education, they're going to say that the essence of fine tablet, but it's a tiny screen.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.640]   You really can't even get many fingers into it.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.840]   There's a limit to the sort of content you can produce to it.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:31.440]   A tentative screen gives you opportunities for so much more interactivity.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:36.240]   And also the sales pitch goes, we have this tool called, called iBooks Author that makes
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.400]   it very, very easy for not only educators, but also for textbook publishers to create
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.080]   the sort of content that will truly exploit this, this sort of platform.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.440]   All Amazon can give you is that, well, they can have this sort of HTML five, actually,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:55.640]   they're not even HTML five, this ePub2 enhancement of proprietary format that can create a single
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:00.640]   scrolling column of text interspersed with photos and clickable videos.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.440]   So I think they have ways to combat that.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.360]   But in the end, the answer to that, those questions is always, well, who knows?
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.320]   Apple can do pretty much anything they want to do.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:14.080]   I do think finding a way to $200, you know, the OLPC is about $200, right?
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.680]   I mean, that's about the cost of the, that's the running cost of those.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:24.960]   And so getting, finding a way to $200 for some kind of tablet would be revolutionary on
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.960]   Apple's part.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.920]   I will say that if they were able to do it, you're not just talking about schools in the,
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:34.200]   whoa, you're not just talking about schools in the, in the, in the US, but schools, you
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.280]   know, I think you have a nuclear meltdown, Mike.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.240]   I, I hope you're prepared.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.880]   I would say scramble the rods now.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.200]   Yeah, it's, you know, it's, it's a, it's a nuclear attack and everybody's running.
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.200]   I'm staying with you.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   Thank you.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   Thank you.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.200]   Good.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.200]   And we're, where are you living now?
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.200]   So we can all leave that area.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.680]   Lotus Los Godos deaf constix.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.040]   Did you know that a little bit of trivia about nuclear attacks in Silicon Valley?
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.040]   Did you know that Kim Jong-il once threatened to turn Palo Alto, California into a sea
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   of fire slag heap?
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.520]   And did he succeed?
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.520]   No.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.520]   No.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.840]   The negotiate, American negotiator, this was back in the 90s, I think was from Palo Alto,
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   California.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.680]   And at some point in the negotiations, he actually pointed his finger at her and said,
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.440]   I will turn Palo Alto into a sea of fire.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:25.000]   It must be hard not to laugh when a four foot eight person with no discernible nuclear
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   capability.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Yes.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Something like that.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.120]   Oh, yes.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.460]   Your lovable dictatorship.
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.460]   Thank you.
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.460]   Wow.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.460]   At all.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.460]   Rattle.
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:41.880]   And we're going to stop now because we have much more to talk about.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:46.080]   Including the deplorable state of technology journalism in the US.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.000]   But before we do that, I already apologize about that.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   It's your fault.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.120]   No, I actually some really interesting rumors about the Apple TV.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:58.400]   I think this March 7th, if it is March 7th, could be fun, could be more than just iPad.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.520]   And let's talk about the one more thing in just a little bit.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.320]   Can Tim Cook do a one more thing?
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.320]   I don't know.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.960]   Scott Forst, he's got to give that up.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.960]   He's got to do one more thing.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.160]   Incredibly Johnny I've.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.560]   Oh, and one more thing.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   Yes.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.120]   There'd be one more thing, but it'd be very exciting.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:23.320]   I don't know if it talks like that.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.120]   Oh, Apple, I'm already trying to treat them.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.120]   And one more thing.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.280]   You got like a Michael Keene thing.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.080]   Hey, here's another thing.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:33.080]   And another thing.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.960]   You don't need to be able to know with a head with education.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.800]   Well, you're going to anyway, aren't you?
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.680]   I should listen to that Michael Keene books more.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.680]   I could tell.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.840]   Oh, my God.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.480]   Let's take a break and come back with more Andy and Naco's here.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.880]   Mike Elgin from the Google Plus.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.000]   Mike, the one thing, and this is the negative about being Mr. Google Plus, is you can't
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.520]   really say from Google Plus.
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:02.560]   Yeah, it's a platform ease of communication issue.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.560]   Right.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.720]   It'd be like saying from WordPress or, you know, I mean, it doesn't.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.720]   Right.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.720]   From Squarespace.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.280]   What do we say?
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.000]   Well, you know, I do have a company called Elgin Media.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   We could say that.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.240]   Mike Elgin of Elgin Media, Elgin.com.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.800]   And then it just goes right to Google Plus.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.120]   And associate who is my wife.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:28.680]   No, it's Elgin.com is works that just redirects to Google Plus, but that's a, you know, sounds
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.640]   better than it sounds less like I work for Google.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.640]   Right.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   So.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   Right.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.520]   Which I've been accused of lately because I've been so, so pro Google Plus.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.760]   You know, we did last night with Trey Radcliffe, the great photographer Trey Radcliffe does
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.920]   a Google Plus hangout every Monday night, which we rebroadcast Trey's variety hour.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:52.120]   And I joined them last night and that is a great format for podcasting for what it
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.120]   is.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.120]   It really works.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:57.920]   Well, I've actually started, I've actually started doing something called the flying
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.600]   circle and it's not about tech.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.120]   I find communities.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.840]   It's about community.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.680]   So I find I did a ukulele circle.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:06.680]   I did a.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.360]   And the order circle, I did it.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.240]   The education one that I mentioned.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.640]   And it suddenly had an epiphany last week.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:18.240]   Why don't I just spin out the audio and the video and make it a podcast.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.200]   And so that's what I'm starting to do.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.120]   And now, and I listened to the, I did it.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.520]   I grabbed an MP3, listened to it and it's a credible format for MP3.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.960]   And this is an example of kind of what I do with my newsletter, which is automatically
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.960]   posted.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:33.960]   I don't touch anything.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.960]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.440]   I have a Twitter feed that's all generated from my Google Plus.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:42.600]   So there's something in there for people for low budget people who, you know, people
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.360]   who want to do a low budget podcast, you can do it for free.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.520]   Are you using the Hangouts on air?
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.200]   Yeah, I have Hangouts on air and it's, it's a pretty, pretty bulletproof and awesome.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.520]   I like it.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.200]   What I just, I mean, we could absolutely, you know, and that I've built this studio, we
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.960]   could have absolutely used that and eliminated all of this stuff.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.720]   But the, the, the problem is that the, the, the quality of the vision of the cameras is,
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.720]   is generally very low.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.720]   Right.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   The conversation tends to be kind of stop and go and awkward because it just, the,
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.320]   well, that's, that's one of the things I realized, you need a good moderator.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.960]   You still need the talent on, on camera.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.960]   Yes.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.960]   You need people who can talk.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   You need a moderator.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.600]   So that hasn't changed, but just the production is much easier than I used.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.320]   But what happens is what typically happens is somebody's making some profound point and
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:33.000]   then somebody coughs and the camera switches to the coffer for like three seconds and,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.240]   you know, weird stuff like that.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.760]   But you can as moderator mute everybody.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.000]   So you can control that, right?
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.720]   You could say everybody's muted except the person is talking and then I will select the
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.440]   next person and unmute them.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.640]   So there's ways to do it.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:50.000]   You can do that in a hangout, but in Hangouts on air, you don't have what you see during
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.520]   the Hangout with Hangouts on air.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.680]   It's not what's recorded.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.920]   So the order that people are at the bottom, all that stuff, and you always go to the Hangout
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.880]   on air and they're like, wow, I didn't realize that that's what was going on.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:06.600]   So it's really, you know, it's great for quick and dirty, super low, you know, low budget.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:07.680]   I tried to explain this.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:12.560]   I did a couple of weeks ago, I did the Bones Brigade, which is a famous skateboarding group.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.040]   And they've been doing gazillion media interviews and stuff.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:23.520]   And I told these guys, you know, the low budget scrappy, you know, that's the charm of it.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.840]   It's, it's, it's like, you know, immediate and low budget.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:33.280]   And it just, I've never seen anybody except President Obama do anything high quality productiony.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.520]   And they spent a fortune on the, on the equipment to do the Obama Hangout.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.520]   Oh God.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.520]   You saw the behind the scenes stuff.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:41.520]   It was yeah.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   So it's, it's not, it's not.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.520]   It's not.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.520]   It's quit and by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.480]   They put the pictures and stuff, yeah.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.680]   That was a beautiful that.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.880]   So we don't, when we record it, when we do trays, we record it.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.800]   So we're not using Hangouts on air for the version we put out, but the version that
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.560]   tray then posts on YouTube, I'm pretty sure is Hangouts on air.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.800]   Because it, so you'd actually, we're getting a different version.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.000]   And we have Tony who runs the board.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Tony Wang does the switching of people.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.120]   So he manually picks people up, I think.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.920]   Well, you can click on their little windows.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:15.920]   I think he's doing that.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.880]   I want to air, Mike, when you, when you do, when you, when you click on it to hold someone,
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   doesn't that hold it on the hand on air as well?
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.040]   That, I don't know.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.040]   Okay.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.040]   There are other restrictions as well.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.280]   For example, on a regular Hangout, you can show video.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.440]   You can say, hey, but he looked at this video and I'd love to be able to do that with Hangouts
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.760]   and air, but you can't do it.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.520]   You can do screen sharing on a Hangout on air, but you can't do, you know, here's a video.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:39.520]   Right.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:44.840]   And I, I frankly doubt that that will ever exist for, you know, just, I don't think Google
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.720]   trusts people will copyright because people are going to say, well, here, you know, let's
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.720]   watch this.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.720]   Let's watch the Super Bowl together.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.760]   So, well, you have to be selected for Hangouts on air.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.400]   It's not open to the public yet.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.400]   That's correct.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.760]   And I, but I think, I think the consensus is that soon they'll open it up to everybody.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.240]   I do see they have moderation controls.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.840]   They have sticky click, right?
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:09.040]   Remote mute, block and invite and trade was using, I think, invite for sure the YouTube
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.040]   button chat.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.040]   Well, that's good.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.040]   I don't, I doubt what they've given us.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:17.040]   They seem to like us for some reason.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.040]   I'll ask.
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.040]   We're going to take a break.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   Come back with more.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   Mike Elgin is here from Elgin Media at Elgin.com.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.040]   That's right.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:28.040]   When you need Rod Scrambled, Mike's the man to do it.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is here from the Pixelcore.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   Gotta give you a big plug this week because you won't be back next week.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:38.040]   pixacore.com for that guild of multimedia artists learning and working together.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.640]   pixacore.tv for the great podcasts.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.840]   We're on, pixacore is also on Google Plus.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:43.840]   Of course you are.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.840]   Why would we start to be more than that?
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.880]   And can we follow, do you still do your blog or anything?
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.040]   Is there any way to follow pixacore?
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.240]   What you're doing personally.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.440]   The best way to follow what I'm doing personally is probably Google Plus and Twitter.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   Okay.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:02.560]   Those are the Google Plus is where I want to put, I put more long form stuff.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.800]   Like today I posted a thing on education.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.760]   And then Twitter is where I can kind of post crazy stuff.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.200]   You're like me, we change all the time.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   I used them.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.200]   We have to use a different.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.200]   I was trying to explain to somebody at the airport.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.760]   I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I used LinkedIn for this and Facebook
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:20.840]   for that and Twitter for this and Google Plus for that and path for this.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.760]   And I don't actually want to give up any, like I used to think I wanted them to merge
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:28.960]   or something like I kind of, they, they're all different little worlds for me.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:32.080]   And Alex Lindsey is at Pixelcore.com.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.600]   I said that, oh, it's Andy Enaco.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.560]   That's the guy over here.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.920]   He is at the celestial waste of bandwidth in the Chicago.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:45.000]   scenes at not co is that is is that the best place to figure out what you're doing?
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.880]   Usually, I not go, calm is the first place is if you want to the big picture is that
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:54.520]   oh so we should get rid of CW Abcom and have it be an Ako calm. Well usually use I pick
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:59.920]   C W Oh B comm because people can probably spell C W O B. How do how do you spell that
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:04.560]   that's the alternative because I mean I didn't even buy an Ako calm for years before I realized
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:11.680]   something else is going to save. That's right. But yeah, no, but it is a problem. I'll end
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.800]   this in 10 seconds. I'm sorry. This commercial has been like link has been like circling
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:20.200]   the runway for about 20 minutes now. No, no, you know what? Yeah, I do something a little
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.200]   different now on the shows. I do plugs earlier on because what we were saving like the Howard
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:29.800]   Stern show, you know, Howard Stern like at 10 o'clock in the morning. Finally, everybody
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.320]   starts plugging for an hour. Right. And I realized nobody's hearing those plugs. So
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:38.800]   I put the plugs in the middle now. I was going to say it was that it's I recently realized
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.920]   that I'm not blogging enough. And that's only because of a lack of effort that every
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:47.040]   day I have lots of cool lots of lots of thoughts that are interesting to me. I read lots of
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.080]   things I want to pass on. But I never actually trained myself to click that button in my
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:56.360]   button bar at the browser and actually blog it because they do so much stuff on Twitter.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:01.560]   So I'm trying to see how far I can go. How long was I actually have a little printed calendar
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:06.640]   on my refrigerator with like with a pen on it that every day I try to blog something even
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.960]   if it's just like one link and like one paragraph explaining that link and to see how long this
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:17.480]   tree can go because it's it's a lack of effort. I'm sorry. I've I have I have failed you the
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:23.640]   people. Those those those those amusing cat videos that I've laughed at but then failed
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:29.440]   to pass on. Well, I I'm aggregating my responsibilities no further or at least every time that I
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.840]   go for free to pop I'll be reminded that oh wait you're supposed to blog something to
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.920]   say weren't you. That's why I do more blogging now audio blog with the audio booth because
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:42.600]   it's because I don't I can't writing slows me down. So I can do that. I do the opposite.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:50.360]   I'm such a compulsive blogger that I have to post on my blog to remind me to eat. That's
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:54.360]   a good idea. I should do that not to eat. Let's talk a little bit about go to me and
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.440]   then we'll come back. We do have those. I'm very interested on what Apple TV might be
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.600]   up to and I have a feeling this panel might have some suggestions but first here is a
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:06.720]   great way to meet with people and see them as you're meeting them. We've talked about
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:10.920]   go to meeting before as screen sharing and still a great screen sharing solution really
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.880]   the kind of the ideal way to have meetings because that's the screen sharing makes it
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:19.720]   more engaging to show a keynote or a PowerPoint Mac or PC cross platform completely. People
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:23.960]   can meet with you on any platform. You're on any platform. But what they've added this
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:29.720]   new HD faces is mind-boggling. It really does make it that this is the trend, isn't it?
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.800]   Is we want to see people. We want to see their reactions. We want to see their faces
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:40.640]   and go to my go to meeting is just remarkable. This HD faces allows you to be doing the screen
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.480]   sharing and see the faces above it. If you go to go to meeting.com right now and there's
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:49.880]   a button right there HD video conferencing watch the video. It is that good. I mean,
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.120]   it really looks that good. But you know, there's another way to find out and try it
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:56.440]   free for 30 days visit go to meeting.com underneath this video here. There's an orange
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.640]   try free button. I want you to see what this is how it looks. So you're having you got
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:06.200]   your screen sharing. Oh, you've got it different than I do. There. Yeah, you've got your screen
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.640]   sharing, but then you have the heads of the people. It's just like this. And you can
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:13.800]   read you can drag them around and stuff. Most people now have very good webcams. They
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:20.120]   can really do this. And it just transforms how your meetings are. If you do team meetings,
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:25.720]   reviews, sales meetings, training, click the try it free button, visit go to meeting.com,
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:31.080]   use the offer code Mac break. One of the you got it free for 30 days. You use this. We do use
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   go to meeting a lot. We use go to meeting go to seminar. And one of the big things that comes
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:39.240]   with a lot of this is also a lot of the management tools. So people always ask me why do you use
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:43.480]   if you have go to seminar or go to meeting, why are you using Hangouts? Well, Hangouts is a lot
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:47.720]   more, you know, it's it's kind of wide open and it's easy to kind of do through the web. But when
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:52.200]   we use go to meeting, it's much more managed. So from a business perspective, it's better.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:57.480]   Right. I mean, it's just it's built for something different. And you're not going to
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:01.560]   sales presentation. You're not going to say, Hey, come, come meet me in Google Hangouts.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:05.160]   I'm I don't think maybe you are. I don't know. It seems like you would probably want something
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:09.080]   a little more perfect. Well, and as I said, it's the ability to manage it, especially when you start
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.120]   to scale is just they've got lots of great tools that are built in. It's fantastic. So you've seen
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:20.520]   the rumors going around that you can't buy an Apple TV anymore, like they're out of stock and they're
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:26.120]   not the guy at Best Buy says we can't get anymore. That usually isn't an indicator that there's a
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.880]   new Apple TV coming on. I'm thinking March 7th. They're not only going to announce an iPad.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:36.040]   Will they announce a new Apple TV? I think they will. 1080p with a you'll be able to use the USB
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:40.680]   for a USB camera for FaceTime. Okay. Wait a minute. I got to adjust this.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.560]   Those are the two things I think will happen. There'll be a camera? No, there won't be a camera
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:52.120]   in the U S there's a USB connector in the current Apple TV. And if you were able to plug a camera
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:56.840]   into that, then you could use it for FaceTime. You know, you know, with your with your TV.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.400]   It makes sense that they go 1080p because even the Roku's got 1080p now, right? Yes.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:05.880]   A camera though, you're cracked. But that's that Mike, but that Mike, that's kind of that
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:10.600]   confirms your your FaceTime thing, right? Apple's going to start to really push FaceTime everywhere,
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.800]   even on your television. I still think that's the living room. The living room experience for the
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:19.240]   camera is a big for FaceTime is a big deal. I mean, I just as a as a as a as a father of little kids
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:25.240]   with their grandparents having FaceTime on in the living room experience would be a big deal for
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:31.640]   their grandparents. I think that I think that the way to look at the way I look at Apple TV and
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:38.200]   the future television that everybody's been talking about forever is that it's really all about iCloud
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:43.400]   and all the things you can do with iCloud and connecting all your devices. I'm convinced that
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:47.960]   the television of the future, not this thing that we're talking about now, but eventually when
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:53.960]   they actually make the hardware that this thing will be remote controllable by every iOS device,
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:59.880]   every device you're in the house, the phone, the tablet, anything you want to use and also come
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.400]   with little remote. I think that'll have a microphone. You talk to Siri, all that stuff.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:09.000]   Now, working back to this announcement, I think that we can almost be certain that there's going to be
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.840]   better iCloud stuff going on, better connectivity between your devices. And if you look at a high
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:21.800]   definition, but that could be done in software, right? Yeah, but I mean, you want to be a
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.760]   high definition iPad, they want to maximize the experience of watching something on iPad and say,
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.960]   you know what? Let's look at this on the TV and just boom, there it is. And they want it to be
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.240]   really high quality. I watched the Grammys. They didn't do the Grammys Grammys, but they did the
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:40.840]   interviews behind the scenes, all that stuff during the Grammys. And we watched it using the
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:49.480]   iPad app, the Grammys app, projected on our 41-inch- Used AirPlay. Yeah. And it was already
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.840]   pretty darn good. And I think this is how Apple starts to make an end run around the cable companies
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:00.120]   and all of the powers that are preventing us from really enjoying TV as much as we could.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:07.000]   And so I think that if you start from the point of view that this announcement is likely to have
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.480]   a better audio-video experience on the iPad, better connectivity through iCloud to the television,
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.160]   then you can start to piece together what they're likely to do. But I think there's no question
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.880]   that they're going to make it easier to continue to do what you've been able to do,
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:29.160]   which is with AirPlay and all that stuff to just move things around on different devices
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.800]   and watch things from one device on another device. And one thing that we've seen third parties do
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.200]   that we haven't seen Apple really dig into is collapsing the modal connection. Right now,
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.440]   we're basically, we use our iPad or we watch TV, but a lot of us are doing both at the same time,
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:48.520]   but we're not-- what we haven't done is start really interconnecting that content so that you
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.920]   can be watching a program and having something that is running with that program on your iPad.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.920]   It's a completely full frame experience on your iPad that's giving you more information or other
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:04.280]   information or chats or all these other things. And I think that that is where one of the things
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.360]   that I think Apple could be eventually moving towards as they start to integrate a lot of the
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.880]   devices, not just controlling those devices, but interacting with the content in multiple ways
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.280]   at the same time. Andy, what do you think? I think that this is finally going to be
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:26.280]   the Apple TV's year. It's no more hobby. It's been around for years and years and years. I think
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:32.680]   Apple knew that they would need at some point in their lives to have a conduit to an actual HDTV
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:37.000]   screen, a conduit into the living room. I just think that for years, they've been sort of trying
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.280]   to figure out via the Braille method, trying to figure out what that sort of conduit is going
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.440]   to be like. So they really have to feel the way around. They have to sort of build it, then look
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.760]   at it and say, "Nope, that's not it. Take it apart. Build another one. No, that's not it."
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:57.560]   I think they finally have it. I wouldn't be surprised at all if the next iteration of the Apple TV
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:03.400]   actually had the iCloud logo molded into the rubber somewhere. That's Andy's prediction.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:11.560]   I cloud in the rubber. It's the middle of things in life. I'll just see, at least I think that they
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.920]   have the opportunity to finally clarify what this device is. They tried it as a destination device
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.960]   where, "Hey, I'm going to go sit down in front of Apple TV and watch some video that's going to
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:26.360]   create for me." That failed. I think they really are going to clarify to where this is going to be
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.400]   a way to shuttle everything you've got in iCloud and all of your different iOS and macOS devices
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.120]   and project that experience onto your screen. I think the part of that is just going to be a
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:41.720]   matter of clarifying the existing menu structure where right now there's just this long bank
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.760]   drop-down menus. To get to what is, for most people, the most interesting and the most useful
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:52.280]   feature, Netflix, that you have to go left, left, left, left, left, down, down, and then selected.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.960]   Even to get to the home-sharing features of iTunes, which is probably the best feature of the thing.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.320]   Again, click click click click. Left, left, left, left, left, down, down, down and then click on
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.680]   what you actually want. I think we're going to see a streamlined interface that simply
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:11.000]   intuitively understands that you've got X devices with all this sort of media on it.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.400]   What is the easiest way to get that media from where you're viewing it previously to viewing it
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:23.400]   on the screen? I really think it is the moment where you stop watching a YouTube video or listen
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.400]   to a podcast off your iPad. You suddenly decide, "Oh, this is nuts. I'm here in the living room.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.400]   I should be listening to it on the really cool screen." Tap, tap, click, and suddenly you're
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.800]   watching on the Apple TV. That's the clarity that the Apple TV has been missing for three or four years.
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:43.560]   How about apps? I'm not sure if apps would even be exposed to the regular developer community.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:49.480]   I think that Apple would be really eager to get HBO Go and the Cinemax app available for iOS
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:57.320]   and it's good app for the Apple TV. To have a special sort of ultra curated channel selection,
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:01.080]   they certainly don't want the Playboy channel to be able to stream
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:07.160]   multiple articulations of the word "stream content" onto their nice little Apple logo device.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.920]   No, then Roku is going to outsell them because you can't on Roku.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:17.800]   Angry Birds is on Roku, right? I'm saying Angry Birds on the Apple TV would be awesome.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:24.040]   I think they have to be Roku. I think this is the Doom 3 of the 21st century.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.760]   Everybody who doesn't want to get their work done say, "Oh, let's find a way to port
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.240]   Angry Birds on this device." I'm sick and tired of it.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:37.960]   I think what's inevitable is the integration of iMessage into Apple into the television experience
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:44.280]   because people like to be social with television and i think iMessage exists and i think it's a
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.960]   great thing. So then your wife can see your messages to your girlfriends. Right there on the big screen,
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:53.960]   that'll be good. Exactly. That'll be good. To sell for them, sorry.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:06:00.600]   Will they do live TV? Because that is the one thing court cutters lose, right?
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:06.120]   And I think that if you combine what Mike just said, if you have in the commenting in the social
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:11.080]   part mixed with the live event streaming, you get out of this very, very compelling.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.280]   Yeah, that's Google TV.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:21.000]   Well, I think that there's live TV as one, problem one option, but simultaneous TV is another.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.360]   So people can say, "Let's all watch." Again, Apple's trying to get at the social networking
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:32.440]   desire in multiple peripheral ways. And one of them is to say, "Let's all watch this movie
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.760]   together on opposite sides of the country and then chat about it while we do it."
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:40.760]   So simultaneous TV is something that can be provisioned from iCloud.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.960]   No, actually, and you do have apps. If you have good AirPlay, you do have apps on your
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:51.240]   iPad. That's another way to get it into that. I mean, people are doing that.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:56.280]   One of the things Google TV does well, and they're not many, but one of the things they do well
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:03.080]   is it's an overlay on top of your live TV so that it's a pass-through box. So you have your cable
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:08.120]   box going to the Google TV, going to the television set. So in a way, you do get the mixture of the
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.840]   two and you get that kind of capability to tweet while you're watching.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:16.440]   I think that's the only solution that Apple has available to them to get live TV on the box,
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:21.800]   because if they're going to have to cut deals with every single channel and every single provider,
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.200]   in terms of these providers are actually going to agree with, they're going to water down this
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:31.000]   concept so it's absolutely useless. Whereas if they try to go for a sling box sort of effect,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.160]   where just plug HDMI out from your cable box into the Apple TV, we will overlay our stuff on it
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:43.080]   when we won't re-broadcast what you've got over the internet, but at least we can get access to
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:48.120]   the nine channels that you actually want. I mean, if Apple would get 99 bucks for me, if all they
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:52.920]   were capable of doing is make it appear as though I'm only getting a let the 11 channels that I
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:58.360]   actually am interested in, and I never have to see, you know, hillbilly hand-fishing volume eight.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.920]   Why don't I really like that show? I just want to let you know.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:08.760]   It jumps the shark after volume six, I think. Well, because they look like they look like
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.520]   Laquanda asked for more money. They didn't match your price. Right. It was all about Laquanda.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.320]   It was. I don't know why they didn't. They can't see it so true. So true.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:21.000]   Tim Cook's giving a presentation in about five minutes at the Goldman Sachs Technology and
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.240]   Internet Conference. Audio is available at apple.com/quicktime/conference if you would prefer to listen to that.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:36.520]   And I don't know how we can do it. Maybe listen in with half an ear. I don't know. We'll pay attention
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.040]   to it if he says anything important. We get to the UN simultaneous translation.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.200]   And do you think it's much better? But let's not know. Just that that that
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:51.800]   fine-effective tone. And now importance of Apple throughout education as historically
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:09:02.840]   been one of innovation in the third quarter. Sucking the emotion out of every conversation
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:10.920]   since 1962. Apple shares went over 500 bucks on Monday. Any shock at all. They're on their way to
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:18.040]   being a half a trillion dollar company bigger than Google plus Microsoft combined. They're
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:26.200]   GDP of Sweden. They're bigger than Sweden. So here's the question is when does Apple's value hit a
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.680]   trillion dollars? What does their stock price need to be to make it a trillion? A thousand?
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:37.000]   Or maybe a little more? 1100? Yeah. 1100 right now. Look at this. This is the
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.240]   week's. Wow. Let's look at the that's is this five days? Yeah, this five days.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.720]   Go for a year. One month. You want to see a year? Look at this. We're just looking at the
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.040]   financial the stock right now. This is again. This is stock price. Look at 10 years.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:10:01.720]   Just as a as an example, as a comparison, you can actually buy an iPad for less money than a
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:07.880]   single share of Apple stock now. Wow. That's really interesting, isn't it? By the way, the red line is
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:18.280]   Dell. Should I add HP? Maybe Apple one day ago. If they really keep a grudge, if they're going to
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:23.640]   buy Dell just to make the CEO dance like a monkey. Now this and I think this right here, this is
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.560]   right here where Michael Dell right at this point where Michael Dell said sell your Apple stock.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.840]   Apple just give the money back to the shareholders. It was right about there.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:43.080]   Wow. 4000% growth. You know what else looks just like that chart is recent
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:48.920]   comparisons between the I think it was profit or revenue profit, I think, of the
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:56.200]   handset market. Whereas the overall handset market when you don't count Apple has been flat
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.560]   for like a decade. Yeah. And all of the growth has been Apple.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:06.840]   Well, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is the orange bar. Basically, it's flat since 2001.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:14.920]   So I buy index funds because I feel it's safe for boy-at-man making a mistake.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:24.120]   Here's the NASDAQ compared to Apple. Wow. Okay. There you go.
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:29.960]   And I think that people think that, okay, what else can they do to keep this going because you
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:35.800]   have to keep growing cars. That's what I'm saying. Well, I think there's China.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.640]   Toasters, China is huge. But Apple's doing well in China. But Apple's doing well in China.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:43.400]   Actually import their iPads into China. Well, yeah, because then there's this company that has
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:49.640]   a trademark right. They'll work all that out. But I mean, if you look at the penetration of
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.880]   Apple stuff into China, it's not very high. That just means opportunity. I mean, look at the,
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.000]   they had to close the Apple stores because there were people throwing eggs at the Apple store
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.680]   because they couldn't get the iPhone 4S. I mean, there's clearly demand in China. Is there not
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:14.600]   Mike? There is huge demand. And I think that I still believe in the iPad Nano. And I think that
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:19.720]   kind of thing would be huge in a place like China where once you sat, China, the way to think of
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.840]   China is that there's a first world about the size of the United States within China. And then
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.400]   there's the rest of China, which is kind of like the third world.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:35.640]   And once you saturate the rich urban people, then you got the rest of China, which is another
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:42.680]   three quarters of a billion people or something. All of that is all in Apple's future. And again,
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:48.200]   Apple's brand is just golden in China. They got TVs, the whole world of TVs, the whole world of
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:55.480]   content, the education and publishing market is all in Apple's future. And I really believe in
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:00.840]   the future of touchscreen desktops, which I think is going to completely revolutionize the,
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:07.000]   the hardware business right now. How much time did we spend today talking about things that are not
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.760]   Max? All of it. There's not much to talk about in the Mac world. I mean, it's all about touch.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:19.800]   But I think once they have the desktop iPad type of device with, you know, with the desktop power,
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:25.800]   but a multi touch display, I think it's going to be a whole new market for and very lucrative
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.600]   market for Apple. Scobel said something on Twitter and a number of people said that can't be true.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.360]   He says, I talked to General Electric, they're replacing their desktops with iPads.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.160]   Are we doing corporate corporations replacing?
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:43.400]   You have the Air Force going 18,000 iPads. I understand the Air Force because it's flight manuals,
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.240]   but really could you replace a person who's doing spreadsheets?
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.480]   But a lot of them aren't doing spreadsheets. That's the whole thing is that a lot of people are
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.720]   just sales guys that are making contact and it's easier to, you know, that's all they're using is
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.680]   the dashboard functions. I mean, if you look at, you know, one of the companies we work with a
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:05.480]   lot of salesforce.com, if you look at their their application on the iPad is amazing. And you can
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:09.160]   keep track of a lot of what's going on in your company and so on and so forth. You don't need
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.920]   for Ottawa, Paul, who must work for him. Keep saying things like, but the playbook does spread
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:20.200]   sheets. Paul, actually, they're not buying playbooks. I'm sorry, Paul.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.960]   It was interesting. A couple months ago, I was actually talking to an IT manager who works for
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:32.360]   like a Fortune 500 company who was saying that he's not replacing iPads, laptops with iPads across
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:37.960]   the board, but he's identified several divisions of that company for which just an administrative
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:44.120]   costs alone of keeping these things running. Buying 900 iPads was going to pay for itself within two
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:49.080]   years. And the and the and the and the security services that they can't really mess around with
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.880]   right is just a training. What's amazing is is that it's exactly why they used to use PCs was
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.520]   because they had so much admin control over the over the over the boxes and why they didn't like
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:05.560]   Macs was because people could futz with them. And now the now you have the iPad is a perfect
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:11.080]   solution for corporations because they can lock it down a fair bit.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:17.560]   There's a conventional wisdom about enterprise and business computing that is somewhat skewed in
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.520]   my view, which is that whenever you talk about enterprise computing, you always talk about the
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:28.040]   needs of the enterprise, need security, you need to access legacy databases, you need to do all
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:34.840]   this stuff you need, you know, and it goes on and on. And this mindset is supported by the people who
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:42.920]   provide, you know, the overly priced, high margin solutions for these types of activities.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:48.360]   But but it but it but a terminal, a computer, a desktop computer, is an interface between a human
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:53.720]   being and the enterprise. And to ignore the human being part, which is always the most complicated
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:59.560]   and expensive part of that proposition is what's wrong with how we think about enterprise computing.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:03.880]   The reason enterprises are embracing the iPad is because it works really well for the human
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:09.480]   being. Yeah, yeah, it's it's intuitive. They don't need a lot of tech support. It's an expensive
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:15.320]   still gonna have computer. I mean, for instance, for backup, for sinking for loading, but it'll be
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:20.680]   the IT department and maybe a few specialized areas where they need, you know, a 30 inch display or
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.440]   whatever it is. Hey, we got to take a break. Let's talk about backup. Actually, since we're
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:29.080]   talking about enterprise backup, the devil's speaker, the devil is absolutely key. And if
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:35.400]   you're on a desktop computer of any kind, Mac or PC, you need to back it up. I don't back up at all.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.480]   Yeah, I know because you why I just don't I just like living on the edge. I don't think that you
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:44.120]   know, I don't like to back anything up because then I would have to worry about it later. And
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:47.960]   so you're like, you're very transient. You're like, well, as people, they don't you don't have
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.240]   anything of value that way you don't have to work like that man with like the one day memory,

[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:21.720]   on your computer. You know, I pictures no financial records back in the old days when I didn't
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:27.720]   actually back. So for us, of course, I'm being the seashis. Oh, I, you know, in our company,
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:31.240]   it's pretty much two places in the cloud for the most important stuff. Yeah, actually,
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.960]   you're the king of backup. You really are. Well, I'm nutty. The one thing that is important
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.720]   because if there's a fire here at the brick house, you lose everything. But if you have it in the
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.480]   cloud, at least your data is secure, right? Yeah. And the things that are the most important,
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:48.840]   my family photos, everything else are in the cloud and the as well as in two different places,
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:53.720]   to back up. And but I, you know, there's a movie that I made with my daughter, you know, 15 years
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:59.000]   ago or whatever. And and but the original footage, I didn't back up or I didn't put it on a couple
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.440]   different drives. And now I just have the 320 by 240 video of my son reading for the very first
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:11.080]   time. It was a 2000, probably 2001. And it was the earliest days of digital cameras. I had a
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.840]   Olympus camera and I just happened to have it when he was reading for the very first time. And I
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:19.720]   took a it's a 15 second video. If I lost that, it would break my heart. So I have that just like
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:24.680]   you everywhere. Yep. Carbonite.com. Thank you very much. Make sure you try it. Thank you for
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:29.240]   your support. Carbonite. I'm gonna have dinner with David Friend, the CEO on Wednesday. I'm
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:37.640]   excited. Nice. Very nice guy. Apple, which I think you can I think you arguably can say
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:45.960]   created the app economy. Yes. Yes. Get some credit creating in four years, 466,000 jobs
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.960]   according to TechNet. I think that's actually competitive with the entire US economy. It is.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:55.320]   I think more jobs were created by Apple than by President Obama in the last four years.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:01.320]   I don't know if that's true, but it's it's certainly half a million jobs is nothing to sneeze at.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:06.680]   But it does include, by the way, Android apps, Facebook apps and the other apps. The app economy
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:15.640]   has just grown. In fact, it is now the the second largest technology job out there.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.840]   Internet publishing is there. Electronic shopping, wireless telecom, software publishers,
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:26.040]   then app economy and then custom. This is interesting. The number one category
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:32.280]   creating more than 600,000 jobs is custom computer programming. That must be for business,
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.560]   writing special apps building, building specific things for hedge funds, derivatives.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:42.600]   It's just doing what seemed what would seem like a very simple process for the government
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:48.120]   or for large corporations. It's like $10 million. Learn cobalt or Fortran.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:55.080]   Here's the growth of the app economy since December 2008. It's pretty good. So anyway,
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:00.760]   that's I think that's something I don't know, just to acknowledge to Mark makes a difference.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:08.200]   Speaking of rim, Mike, we can't hear you. Just in case you're wondering, Mike, are you speaking?
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.880]   I am speaking. Oh, hi, Mike.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:16.360]   I'm going to hear you now. Do you have anything you'd like to say? I do.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:25.080]   Yeah, the chart you showed about the economy, first of all, most of the people who are employed
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:31.640]   in making apps would be employed making something else if the iOS. They'd be writing their
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:36.440]   derivatives programs in a visual basic for what's interesting about it. Yeah, what's interesting
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.280]   about it. It also doesn't tell you the jobs are the lost because something has been made more
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.360]   efficient with an app that you use to be. That's a good point.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:48.520]   Something else. But I think what it really shows you is there's always a knee jerk desire for
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:54.360]   manufacturing to take place in the United States instead of China. This always confuses me.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:00.040]   Things like the iOS platform and all the apps from all the platforms and software development
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:06.360]   general and all that kind of work, that's high paid, high skilled, wonderful type of labor.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:12.280]   I've heard somewhere and maybe it was on this show that you guys can tell me, is that the
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:19.800]   amount of money for each iPhone purchase that goes to China to pay everybody involved in China
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:28.040]   is $10. Wow. And the vast majority of it is spent on wages in the United States. So why do we want?
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.840]   Why is there a desire for sweatshops to exist in the industry? We don't need that.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:42.120]   After the new sweatshops. I think if I were if I'm talking to kids in high school, I'd say
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:48.200]   learn, learn iOS, learn iOS or learn Java, learn learn code because you can make a job.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:52.600]   You know, there's I wonder, I'm really curious how many of those 466,000 jobs
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.400]   were for companies or were individuals. You know, half of them I bet were individuals.
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:02.920]   It reminds me of the whole outsourcing off-shoring mania that took place a few years ago. Everybody
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:08.120]   was stressing out about all the jobs being lost to India. And then when the facts came in and
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:13.640]   you realize that most of the money spent on off-shoring is spent by countries outside the United States
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:19.560]   off-shoring to the United States. This isn't that interesting. And the reason is that the high
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:26.520]   dollar, you know, the consulting firms, the big, you know, the expensive types of off-shoring happens
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:32.280]   in the US. And it's the horrible tech support for vacuum cleaners and stuff that takes place in
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:38.040]   India. Why do we want that? I mean, India, there's some companies in India that do a great job with
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:44.120]   that stuff. They're better at it. They speak English better and let them have it. It's a
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:49.400]   wonderful globalization has benefits. Well, and I think that one of the things that this is a
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:54.360]   little bit of a this weekend tech thing, but when we see like budgets coming out that are really
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:57.240]   talking about building more roads and building more infrastructure, what we really need to be
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.760]   doing is building more fiber. You know, we need to make sure that small towns have 100 megabit
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:06.200]   connections and you know, or gigabit connections, not getting more asphalt between the two towns.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.720]   What we need is more fiber between the towns and people having more access to that because that
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:13.720]   will grow the economy much faster than putting more asphalt on the ground. You know, and I think
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:18.680]   that that when we see stats like this, it's pointing towards the economy that we should be
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:26.040]   pushing people towards not, you know, continuing to prop up the past. Exactly. Exactly. Moving
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:30.040]   right along here. Anybody listening to Tim Cook? Anything interesting? Let's hear what
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:38.040]   I think I've got Tim Cook playing. We partner with local colleges to provide courses like English
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:47.480]   and entrepreneurship and computer skills in the life. More than 60,000 employees have attended
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:51.000]   these classes. Oh, you know what they're talking about? Which is pretty exciting. I think you.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:58.600]   Yeah. When you think about it, if you could take all of these employees and move them to one location,
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:07.160]   it would be a campus population larger than Arizona State. It's kind of talking about the
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:12.200]   same thing we're talking about really, which is jobs created by this new economy. I think that,
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.360]   well, what he's talking about there though is moving iTunes U open to, you know, make it more
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:20.200]   available for corporations because, I mean, there was a corporation that we were just, I was just
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:24.920]   talking to that they're standardizing on iPads because of the iBooks author, because they're
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:28.600]   going to be able to put all their training into it and they can have every manager can be building
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:32.760]   books on how their processes get done. And it's available for everyone quickly. When they
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:38.520]   need to update it, they just update that page and it updates across every iPad. You know, that's a
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:44.840]   it's a very compelling story for, you know, for using an iPad and an corporation. So what could
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:53.240]   possibly be of interest to Apple, Microsoft and RIM, all three to band together and spend millions
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:26:00.120]   of dollars together, billions of dollars together, Microsoft, RIM and Nortell, I mean, oh, I gave it away
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:07.720]   and Microsoft, they bought the Nortell patents, the Department of Justice has approved that acquisition
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:14.040]   along with an approval of Google's acquisition of Motorola. So, you know, what it really is is
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:17.960]   chess pieces, isn't it? We're moving chess pieces on the board. Well, it sounded like this was more
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.160]   of a defensive one. I mean, when you actually read a lot of the articles on this, it sounded like
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.080]   what they wanted to make sure of is they didn't get some troll buying it up and then suing them
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.440]   for it. Like what they wanted to do is because they're not, well, you could say that. I mean,
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:32.920]   I guess it depends. If there's something really juicy in there, you could sue Samsung over. I'm
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:36.280]   not sure they wouldn't do it. Possibly. A lot of their statements around it have been that what
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:39.800]   they want to do is keep those open. Yeah, that's what everybody says. Oh, we're just protecting our
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.600]   interests. It's mutually assured destruction. So it's what Chris Chuff said about building
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:50.600]   missiles. Nobody's going to say, yeah, it's an offensive weapon, but it is. It is an insane by
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:57.560]   product of our even more insane patent process. It's just the this kind of activity is built in to
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:04.840]   the, you know, the crazy way that patents are done and approved and so on. I would say I was
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:08.440]   saying it's not even just the crazy way patents are. I said the way we handle intellectual properties
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:12.840]   in the United States is reaching bankruptcy. You know, it's like, it is. These billions of dollars
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.240]   are essentially wasted. Yeah. That could have been put in a R&D, all sorts of things, and they're
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:22.040]   just essentially wasted, even if it's pure defense. And I don't know if you really could say it's
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:27.480]   pure defense. You know, Apple just try to get is trying to block sales of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.840]   in the United States. They're suing Samsung this week. They sued Samsung over that.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:36.120]   You know, Apple is not a shrinking violet when it comes to defending its intellectual property.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:41.480]   This is Steve Jobs' thermonuclear war against Google and it's never going to stop. They're
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:47.640]   going to nickel in time every Google partner over everything that they can. And it's just,
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.000]   and they don't need to win. That's what people don't understand is they don't need to win.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.640]   All they need to do is slow it down. You know, there that's all they need to do while they
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:00.600]   continue to innovate. I think it's kind of unfortunate, but there it is. And you know, it may not just
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:06.600]   be a bet against Google. Samsung is rapidly emerging as the number two manufacturer of smartphones.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:12.440]   I mean, like by a large margin, they're the guy. So it's not a surprise that Apple has been going
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:19.080]   against Samsung in Australia and Germany and the US. They're hitting Samsung everywhere they can.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:26.680]   It also bears investigating that Apple is not like most companies of their size. When you look at
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:31.800]   the companies that rank on their level, not only in the amount of money that they're taking in,
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:38.120]   but also their awareness across multiple levels of society, can you name many companies that only
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:44.120]   make really one product? All of Apple's success, all of Apple's monster profits and all of Apple's
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.840]   power right now is coming just through iOS. When you look at the more traditional companies that
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:54.920]   are in the top five top 10 spots, you're looking at companies named like, you know, Orange Tree.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:00.040]   And they make pharmaceuticals, they make truck parts, they've learned telecommunications,
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:05.560]   they are so their interests are so spread out that any failure on any one part of their business
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:10.040]   or any new competition that they can't really address. That's not quite so bad. That doesn't
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.760]   really undermine the entire company. Apple right now, they all they have is iOS. And they're the
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:22.200]   only company that really has their stuff together fusing mobile, fusing mobile, all forms of wireless
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.800]   communications and even integrating it into the living room and the desktop.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:34.760]   But if a sufficiently clever and creative company were to hook up with another sufficiently clever
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:39.400]   and creative company, one company that has the mobile part of it, another one part has the
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:44.040]   desktop part of it. And another part of it that simply has, we know how to cut deals with big
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:49.240]   entertainment conglomerates and big communication companies. It wouldn't take all I don't think
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:53.880]   that there in any, Apple's in any danger in the next three or four years. But I wonder if five or
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:30:00.120]   10 years from now, they're going to be in the Dell position or the HP position where because they
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:05.400]   put so much of their effort and their passion into iOS and they never branched out and never
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:11.160]   never really worked on the next thing, never figured out what they're going to do after iOS.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:15.400]   That's this is the first month in which I've been looking at these numbers and wondering, well,
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.360]   what does Apple have beyond iOS plan? Because they're going to need that plan sometime.
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:25.480]   Cars. Apple, you know, it's interesting. NPD group just put out a report yesterday that said
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:33.080]   consumer electronic sales in the US basically flat, 144 billion dollars last year, which is a
[01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:43.080]   half percent less than 2010. But Apple increased 36%. So in fact, if you take Apple as the equation,
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:49.720]   consumer electronic sales tumbled, but Apple 36%. So you're right. I mean, Apple is the company
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:55.000]   at this point in consumer electronics. Apple accounted for 19% of all sales dollars a consumer
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:04.200]   gadgets sold twice as many as HP. Somebody on Google's website made the point that this is bad
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:09.240]   for the consumer electronics industry because all of the energy and activity is happening from one
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.480]   company and it's hurting the other companies and so on. And I think it's quite the opposite.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:18.600]   The reason Apple is doing so well is that they are giving people what they want. They're making
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:24.840]   products and services that function the way to win. Exactly. And if everybody is now gunning for
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:30.760]   Apple and how do you gun for Apple? You imitate them, you reverse engineer the qualities that
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:36.600]   make them successful, things like simplified branding. These companies like Samsung, Quick,
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:43.560]   named the top 30 brands that Samsung has for phones. A lot of these Asian handset manufacturers
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:48.440]   have horrible branding. They create confusion and buyers remorse and the paradox of choice
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:54.440]   among consumers. All that stuff, those companies need to learn from Apple that put all your energy
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:32:00.600]   and resources into a very small number of really great products and then unify them through services
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.720]   and all that. That's the right way to go. So I think it's great for the industry that--
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:08.840]   And I don't think that if I don't think we would have had phones the way we have them now or the
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:12.360]   or the competitive race that we have without the iPhone. Apple is leading by example but at the
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:17.400]   same time let's not forget that they are a cutthroat competitor not only with lawsuits.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:23.560]   This story just came out that Apple is putting pressure on pegatron which makes iOS devices
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:29.160]   to stop making Zen books for Asus tech. The Asus Zen book is a MacBook Air clone.
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:38.280]   I think this is actually-- This may not be tried. Apple figures out how to create their new
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:44.840]   their super thin airs. Then they have these guys build it and then these guys do the same thing
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:52.200]   for somebody else that I would even give them the option. No they're doing the MacBook Air.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:56.120]   It says pegatron only recently landed iPhone orders and is hoping you'll assemble iPad 2.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:59.720]   Before that it was building the MacBook Air and now it's building the Zen book. So it's taking the
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:06.040]   same formulation that Apple figured out how to do and basically giving it to somebody else.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.760]   If I was Apple I wouldn't even be giving the option. I would have just taken it.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:13.480]   It's not supposed to technology as the experience. I mean you're not suggesting that Apple didn't--
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:17.560]   If Apple created new manufacturing procedures that they didn't patent those and they didn't
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.640]   subject those to such tight licensing that this company can't possibly move forward.
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:26.680]   It is important that this is a company that's had experience milling a
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:32.920]   unibody aluminum ultralight. No books like this but it seems to me a little bit more like they
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:38.200]   are engaging in bullying tactics. If you take an Apple contract you're never going to be able to
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:43.880]   work for another competitor. If I had a company-- If I had a company-- I have a company. I would
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:48.600]   never contract with someone who's doing exactly the same thing for somebody else ever. Okay.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.600]   I think the pegatron used to be Asus. It's a spin-off.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:53.880]   It's a spin-off.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:58.200]   But I was saying if they're making something look exactly like mine I would never--
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:02.120]   I would just take the contract away. Which is what they're offering to do. I mean it's just
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:05.400]   crazy to have someone doing the exact same thing. It means every time you innovate you're
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.320]   innovating for your competitor doesn't make any sense. I think that they may be doing pegatron a
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:14.840]   favor because I think it's very likely that Apple's going to shut down the Zen book through the courts
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.400]   and if pegatron is-- Well actually it wouldn't be doing them a favor. They'd probably still get paid
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:25.640]   by the manufacturer. It says Apple's-- Apple's Airs are manufactured by another company,
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:32.120]   Catcher Technology. Pegatron never made Airs. What they are just recently for the first time
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.680]   got an Apple contract to make-- Okay, I thought they were making the Airs.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:40.840]   So it's not that. It's the Apple saying hey we don't want you making stuff for a competitor if
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:46.600]   you're making stuff for us. Probably not illegal. But a little bit exercising some-- a little
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:56.520]   bullying. Yeah, does this remind you of the things that various empirical-- various empire-ish
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.840]   nations used to engage in 100 years ago where they'd move into a territory. Say I know that you
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:04.520]   have your own economy. I know that you produce your own sort of food, your own sort of products,
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.560]   but we're going to mess up your economy so that you could only produce items for it. That we want
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:15.640]   you to export to us. That makes this whole economy totally dependent on the whims and the financial
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:18.920]   arrangements they have with this one entity. If this one entity decides that you know what,
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.920]   we don't want your paper products. We don't want your linen anymore. They move out. Now this whole
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:27.880]   entity is totally screwed. But that's not what's happening here at all. Yeah, that's not what's
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:33.080]   happening here at all. If you-- let's say for example, I mean it's a question as to whether or not
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:38.680]   the Zen book is a total rip-off of intellectual property. And it plus-- Side by side, you can't
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:45.320]   let it be the two. They're very similar. It's a total rip-off. If it is a an actual theft of
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:53.400]   intellectual property, then it's not bullying for Apple to oppose that theft at every point that it
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:36:00.840]   can. That's fair for Apple to protect its intellectual property. I think-- okay, but so I agree with
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:05.640]   you. And if we have any disagreement, it's conditional upon whether or not this company is engaging in
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:09.640]   any theft of intellectual property. Exactly. I guess I would say even if it's not,
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:15.400]   building something that looks exactly like my-- and I'm just speaking as a company owner. I just
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:22.600]   would be like, if someone that was supplying me stuff was doing that to me, there'd be a big--
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:27.880]   Oh, somebody might be-- somebody might be-- to go out and do this week in. And it looked a lot like
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:33.560]   Twit. And it had a lot of similar stuff. And maybe they had worked for Twit and got all the ideas
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:36.920]   from Twit and started another company that was very similar. I wouldn't bother me at all.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:45.080]   My worry is that-- and let's divorce this from what is or is not going on with the company.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:51.160]   But in general, I feel as though Apple has a right to control the technology that they developed,
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:55.400]   that Apple themselves developed for the production of the MacBook Air. They don't have the right
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:01.720]   to control this company's ability to mill aluminum to specification and ship that as a product.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:05.000]   They just have the right to control this. I'll let they want to pay this company. We will buy from you
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.160]   a lifetime license on your ability to mill aluminum to really cool tolerances.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:14.120]   But they're not controlling them. They're just saying it's us or them.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:17.000]   It's just all they're saying is us or them. They can continue to do those. They're not saying
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.320]   we're going to stop. And I think that might be-- depending on the circumstances, that might be
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:26.600]   a bullying tactic. Apple has the right to do business with any other company that it wants
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:31.720]   for any reason that it wants. And again, that's true whether you're not
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:35.800]   divorced from the intellectual property issue. But in Apple's mind, it is not divorced from
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:41.560]   intellectual property. If there is no question that the Zen book exists because the MacBook Air
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:49.480]   is successful. And I'm sure that the Apple has a hair trigger on that concept. I'm sure that
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:55.560]   Apple believes that that is a complete theft of their design ideas, of their aesthetic,
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:05.320]   and their intellectual property. But again, Apple doesn't owe pegatron any business.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:10.280]   They can choose any manufacturer for any reason. So I think when you talk about what companies have
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.040]   the right to do, I think it's fair. I don't think it's bullying at all. I think it's--
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:19.800]   It just worries the whole out of me. My worry, and I will underscore this as a worry only,
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:23.640]   that what next is going to say, I'm sorry, Sharpe. You're not allowed to make tablet displays
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:28.600]   above a certain resolution, or else we'll take it. You're not allowed to make a headphone jack
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.960]   that you can manufacture of high quality for less than two cents apart, or else we'll take
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:37.720]   your business elsewhere. I mean, they're a company that got word, we had got not only through
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:43.960]   smart business practice, but through innovation. And it's tactics like this applied not so simply
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:49.960]   on a step-by-step level, but on a philosophical level. This becomes part of the culture of the
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.840]   way that they do business. This is what turns them into Sony in eight years. I mean, they had a
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.520]   really cool product. Remember, whenever we used to have an iPhone and an iPad, oh man,
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:03.720]   I was at a nostalgia Halloween party where people actually had an iPad out instead of using
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:07.720]   the stuff that the actual innovator is using right now. So it's just something I'm worried about.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:11.560]   Here's an interesting image. Just from all things digital. On the left, the original
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:17.400]   Android phone has demonstrated by Sergey Brin before the iPhone came out. On the right, the G1
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:23.320]   from HTC, the first Google phone, which came out after about four or five months after the iPhone.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:31.560]   Right. Look, it's called playing hard. And there's no question that Apple has the right
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:37.560]   to lose side by side picture of the Roku of the Apple TV, the road, the road, the box,
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:41.560]   and the Apple TV after the road. That's true. But there's no question that Apple,
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.960]   or any company has the right to play hard. It's really more a question of is it good business?
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:50.920]   And I from the point of your point of view of consumers, I would prefer to see companies just
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.640]   innovate and not sue each other over intellectual property because giving us the choice, improving
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:00.360]   somebody, you know, Android is better because of Apple. That's good for us. Right.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:06.200]   May not be good for Apple. So I think it's and I do think that it can be bad for Apple to be
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.920]   overly aggressive. But I think that I think that in Apple's DNA is the 1980s, they want to
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:15.080]   not pay much attention to Windows and Windows snuck up on them and ask them. And I think that
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:19.720]   they are they, I think that the DNA that Apple has now is that we're not going to have that
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:23.960]   happen again. And I think that told me that in 1995, he said, we let Windows catch up,
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:28.280]   right? And I think that that was a lesson that he learned and he determined that shall never
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:31.880]   happen again. And I think that he really, I think he was really attached to Google. I think he was
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:35.160]   attached to Schmidt. He was attached to Google. He was excited about them. He was excited about
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:40.920]   partnering with them. And they in his and his eyes, they screwed him. And I think that that means
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:45.560]   that basically they will attack Android at every moment. But I think that in general, they're going
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:48.840]   to attack anything that tries to catch up with them because they've seen that picture before and
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:52.600]   it wasn't a good one. You know, they, you know, they've already seen this movie and they're not
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:58.360]   determined not to have that happen again. Some good news for independent artists,
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:03.720]   Toon Kor, which collects royalties for music artists, was just got to check from Apple for
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:10.200]   $10,000 for iTunes match. And as Toon Kor says, this is this is money that no one would have ever
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:16.440]   seen. But thanks to iTunes match, some money is accruing to artists who otherwise probably would
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:22.200]   have made nothing. Very quickly now to a lot of checks for $4. Yeah, $10,000 is not a lot of money.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:30.600]   This is Eddy Q in a very poor dark picture of Eddy Q receiving a special Grammy honoring Steve
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.560]   Jobsie. Grammy's decided not to do that on national television, but apparently in the dark
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:43.480]   in a ballroom somewhere in Muncie. It was a the other Grammys. It was the people's
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:50.920]   grandmies. It was a special merit award in recognition of his contributions to the field of music
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:57.320]   with the iPod and the iTunes music store. Yeah, like he kind of saved the industry. You know,
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:02.920]   and finally, very good news. You've heard, of course, a lot about Apple. It's manufacturing a
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:08.840]   lot of controversy over those factories. Apple has now announced they announced this that they're
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:15.560]   going to audit the factories where Apple technology is made overseas. This outside organization
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:23.000]   will be auditing iPhones, iPads and other Apple factories. Remember last month they gave out the
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.680]   name of their suppliers. So they're they're following up and I have to say good on them.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:32.200]   I really think that this is an effective Tim Cook versus Steve Jobs as well. I mean,
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:37.640]   I think Tim Cook is much more responsive to philanthropy, much more responsive to Apple's
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:42.040]   public image. I think Steve Jobs got away with a lot because of his reality distortion field.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:49.640]   And I think that Tim Cook is moving Apple forward into a more holistic type approach to the to
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:55.000]   their PR. They chose the Fair Labor Association. Some labor groups say this is not exactly an
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.280]   independent organization. You know what? Hey, they're they're doing something. And I think that's a
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:06.760]   good baby steps, baby steps, a plod, applause for Apple for at least paying attention to this.
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:11.320]   We're going to take a break here. Pics the iOS tips your lion tips all still to come as we continue
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:17.400]   with Mac break weekly. Mike Elgin from Elgin.com Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core and of course,
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:22.120]   Andy and not go from the Chicago Sun times talking. Is there any Mac news at all?
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:26.120]   No, I love my Mac.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.720]   I got a new one. I got a new one. I got a new one.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:33.320]   Quickly, and people complain. They say, well, where's the Mac news? You know what? It's not us.
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:38.200]   It's Apple. If Apple doesn't do anything for the Macintosh, what are we? My only my only
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:42.120]   Mac intuition is that I would say that I would never ever own a laptop that does not have an SSD
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:47.320]   in and again. I was loving it. Awesome. I have a big S.C. drive and it's just like,
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:50.680]   suddenly everything just happens quickly. So I go back to my old computer and I thought it
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.440]   was broken. I realized it was not broken. It was just a it's just a hard drive.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.360]   It's a hard drive. Just shows you IO is important, at least as important as CPU.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:03.080]   Yeah, absolutely. Speed of your input app. Hey, let's talk a little bit about Smile software.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:07.320]   We had G. McDonald on the show the other day. I love G. I love I love Smile software.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:10.840]   If you go to smile software.com/macbreak, you can take a look at their newest product.

[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:44.040]   images. And I love this automatically store those PDFs in the cloud. So you have them
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:51.080]   on your Mac and your iPad. They use Dropbox, Evernote and Google Docs. So this is just a fantastic way
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:56.440]   to manage PDFs on your iPad. Of course, who else would do a better job than Smile software? These
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:45:01.160]   guys are brilliant. I use text, expander and PDF pen on the desktop. That's how I do all my
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:06.680]   contracts. It's fantastic. I just bought it. $10. Well worth it. It's available in the App Store.

[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:22.840]   Smile software.com/macbreak if you want to find out more and then fire it up on the iPad.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:25.480]   And I love how it integrates with the PDF pen on the Mac.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.640]   And it does something that I really like. Look at these doing this messing up. I listed all
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:32.600]   up, but I was playing with it. I was looking at the response of this. So one of the things that
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:37.160]   it does also is it does it smooth like when you're doing your signature. It smooths it out. A lot
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:41.000]   of them don't do that. No. And it has these kind of pixels, which is a giveaway. Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:48.200]   Dead giveaway. It's really nice. Let us. Sorry. Just trying to show what he was talking about.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:54.600]   Oh yeah. There you go. So you draw your signature. Actually, I keep my signature in the
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.880]   library, but the first time you draw it, you could draw it and it will smooth it out. So there you go.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:02.440]   Hello, my name. Watch this little jaggy and just smooth it out.
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:08.360]   It's hard to see on that on that screen. Yeah, it's cool. It's very cool.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:12.680]   Thank you. Smile. Smile software.com/backbreakdow time.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:21.080]   Do you want to do an iOS tip? Alex, go to it. So this was from Ron Brinkman, my friend,
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:26.280]   Ron Brinkman, who was who gave us his tip for your phone. So what you may not know is,
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:30.440]   of course, you can you can tap it and you know, get it to get different exposures when you're
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:35.640]   taking pictures on your iPhone. Move it over your keyboard. There we go. So down a little
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:40.040]   room area. So I can, I can of course tap it and it's going to focus there. If I hold it,
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:45.320]   it will, you'll see it blink. See how that little blink happens there? So that was exposure as opposed
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:50.360]   to, no, that'll lock your that lock to your exposure and your focus both on whatever that is.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:54.760]   So it's not good. So so if you turn up, if we turn it somewhere else and I click on it once,
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:57.720]   it's going to, it's going to of course get that exposure. But if I move it, it's going to immediately
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:03.080]   change that exposure. See, if I go back here and hold it, hold it, see it, see that there.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:07.400]   And once it once it does that, now it's going to that exposure and focus is going to stay the same.
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:09.960]   I had no idea. That's a great little tip. Thanks, Ron.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:14.600]   Very handy. How about a Mac OS tip from Andy and I co?
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.800]   This is indeed a line tip. This is more of something that you have in your back pocket when
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:24.840]   your Mac starts to screw up. I friend of mine emailed me the other day because he
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:29.560]   he was trying to save a text out of document and then got one of those really super helpful
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:33.400]   errors saying that I'm sorry. I'm not allowed to do that right now.
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:40.600]   No, no, no explanation of what the problem is or how to fix it. It was a problem with the permissions
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.440]   on the some a bunch of files that he had inside his home folder, his personal folder.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:49.000]   And most people are familiar with the idea of repairing permissions on your drive.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000]   If you go into this utility, there's actually a button that says verify
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.800]   disinformation, disk permissions and repair, disconnect, this permissions. These are supposedly,
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:01.960]   these features are supposed to look at the file permissions that are on each file.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:06.280]   At a low level, the operating system is allowed or not allowed to touch modified,
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.480]   delete, move certain files. So if you have a document, for instance,
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.080]   and its permissions have gotten screwed up a little bit at the OS level and the OS
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:16.680]   thinks, I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to open this anymore. I'm not allowed to modify this anymore.
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:20.520]   This is a lot file. That's how you can get some really bizarre behavior.
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:26.360]   Now, unfortunately, though, that you, this utility only works on OS directory sort of stuff.
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:31.160]   It's designed to prevent screwy behavior on the OS level. It's not designed to fix problems on
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:37.000]   files that are inside your home folder. With Lion Apple actually hid a really cool home folder,
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.280]   repaired file permissions utility, and they made it really difficult to use. And I don't know why
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:47.480]   they did that. But if you ever have the sort of problems we think, maybe I should start by
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.320]   start off by fixing the file permissions inside my home folder. What you have to do is you have to
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:57.480]   restart your Mac and go into recovery mode. So hold on command R while you restart. You'll be,
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:03.000]   you'll eventually be dropped into their, that really cool thing that in Lionware, it lets you
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:09.640]   boot off the recovery boot off of your recovery partition and run a bunch of utilities.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:16.520]   Click on your hard drive. When you go to, actually, this is the sort of thing where I need to actually
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:21.000]   see it in front of me. So actually, I'm going from a list that actually typed in to remind me.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:27.160]   After you get into there, you get the repair utility screen after you restart into recovery
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:32.760]   mode. Go into the, if you go into the menu bar, you can launch a terminal window, go into that
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:40.360]   terminal window and type reset password reset password reset P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D. That is the reset
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:46.120]   password utility. But with Lion, they added this extra feature. You will launch into this really
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:53.640]   cool, this macOS app that will allow you to select your hard drive, select a specific user account,
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:57.320]   and then there'll be a button saying repair just permissions on this home folder. Click that button,
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:01.240]   wait a couple of minutes, and then restart and it will fix your permissions. So obviously,
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.840]   you're probably not writing all this down as I'm saying it. What I'm saying is that remember
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:09.720]   that this trick exists. Remember that at some point in the future, you'll think, oh, what, how do I do
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:15.400]   that? Just do a Google search on repair home folder file permissions. And you'll find about four
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:20.680]   different run downs of these procedures. I try to give that tip to that friend of mine who was
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:24.360]   having the problem solved immediately and probably caught a whole bunch of other files that were
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:30.200]   going south for some reason, for the same reason. How does permissions get messed up in any way?
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:38.760]   God knows. We forget that this were no longer working with DOS 3.2 on the Apple II,
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:43.800]   where things happen in a really predictable linear one thing at a time fashion. An operating
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:51.480]   system really is like a giant living organism. And one electron bouncing off of the right,
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:56.520]   the wrong cell in exactly the wrong way can cause this creature to die three years from cancer.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:00.200]   And we will never be able to track back that first inciting incident that caused the problem
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:06.120]   to create. I remember four years ago, I recognized that that was one of my many areas of ignorance.
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:10.840]   And I asked, well, how do file missions get screwed up? And then two people talked to me for about
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:16.200]   two and a half hours total. And basically, they got after two and a half hours, they got too
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:20.360]   well. And that's one of the 18 different reasons why it could happen. But no, you'll never know why.
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:25.960]   It could be cosmic rays. Because I think it's often scholars, because that's
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:30.120]   dollars because mankind is born under trouble just as surely as the sparks fly upward. It was
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:34.520]   right there in the New Testament all along. I'm surprised at how often it actually fixes things.
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:38.200]   Like I'm always like, this is like one of the few things that can go wrong on the Mac, actually.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:45.000]   There is a support dot apple.com. There's a very good long article that includes this tip and many
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:52.440]   others on repairing permissions. It's article H T two nine six three. I remember that want to
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:57.640]   become an expert on permissions. And now it's time for our picks, Mr. Elgin. I don't know if we
[01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:03.880]   asked you, do you have a pick for us? I do indeed. And you guys, I think you guys are way too
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:12.600]   useful and practical. And in fact, I've probably gotten more of my software that I use from this
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:16.680]   show than anything else. So I'm going to I'm going to break with tradition and show you something
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:22.920]   completely useless. Good. Now this is a musical instrument created by a jazz saxophonist named
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:28.200]   bassist Trump. And it was his master's thesis at the University of Arts in Berlin. And I'm not a
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:34.280]   big fan of musical instruments on the iPad per se, especially the invented ones. But this one is
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:39.880]   something beyond a musical instrument. It's called, it's called the Orpheon. Let me see if I can
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.960]   hold that up and see if you can see that seeing the reflection out my window there. But I guess
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:50.360]   you can't see it. But you can hear it. So it's a bunch of Venn diagram type circles. And each one
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:54.840]   is a musical note, but the sound is quite hypnotic. So see if you can hear this.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:07.640]   Sounds like a Japanese bookie theater. Walk upon the rice paper.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:12.120]   So it does all the yes, exactly. And if there are multiple, I mean, you can't see this, right?
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:20.040]   Let me kick out a bit of circles. Yeah. But you can change it to, you know, five circles,
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:25.080]   three circles, 50 circles or something like that. And for just something to be sitting on
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:29.720]   your and you can change the tone and the sound is a very customizable. What's great about this?
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:34.920]   You know, Andy and I were talking before we started the show about the value of the
[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:40.280]   ukulele as a kind of a distraction between where we're waiting for something to download or load
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:44.040]   or something like that. And this also does that function. You can have it sitting there and you
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:49.160]   can sit there and just, you know, it's kind of zone out and you can actually play real music.
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:54.840]   I can't, you can, but I can't. You can do chords and all that kind of stuff. So it's really a
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:54:00.920]   really cool $5 app that's just fun brain candy to sit there and zone out on. I like that.
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:12.040]   Yeah. How do you spell it? O R P? Yeah. Oh, it's O R P H I O N O R P H I O N. Look, Alex has also
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.200]   bought that. This is a very expensive show for me. It's cost me $15 and I've only been sitting here.
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:22.840]   It sounds like it's pentatonic. So you can't play the wrong note, right? Exactly. Yeah.
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:31.880]   Wow. That's so cool. They have a jazz chord thing. That's neat. It's the O Fion. It's an
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:36.280]   ex-run Raku puppet performance. Yeah. Exactly. You're going to do the puppet sandy and we'll play
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:43.560]   the music here. And then you have to have something go clock.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:52.200]   Oh, I got scarred at table.
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:55:03.000]   One more thing. All right. I got a pick. It's this. It's a nicely milled piece of aluminum.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.800]   This is the. I can't make that. Nope. Apple owns milled aluminum.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:13.320]   Ah, damn it. Go to hell. This cannot be made at Asus. This is called the Magnus. And actually,
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:17.880]   I need to borrow an iPad to show this off. You got one there. Mr. Alex Lindsey, this comes from
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.840]   10 one. They do great stuff. You know, they did that wonderful pen that we loved. This is an iPad
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:27.240]   stand. I actually can't get mine out. It's about 50 bucks. Well, what's great about it? We saw this
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:33.080]   at Mac world Expo actually and they sent me one. This has the magnets here that take advantage of
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:39.960]   the magnets on the iPad. So what you can do is it will when you see it, you can see it doesn't
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:43.560]   have much of a lip, but it's sufficient because of the magnets. It'll slot right in there. Now,
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:48.200]   it doesn't show multiple angles. It's really kind of an upright thing. You couldn't type on the iPad
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:53.320]   for that, but it'd be good for a photo frame, that kind of thing or a display. It's a good corporate
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:56:01.160]   use of the iPad. That's the 10 one design Magnus. And I believe it's $50. Let's see. They say they
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:05.400]   also you might as well you ordered the Pogo sketch pen. You might as well get that while you're
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:11.320]   there. $49.95. It is in stock. It's for the iPad 2 only because it uses the magnets. I would show
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:15.480]   it to you, but I kick it. My case off. Well, that's a good case. Whatever you have. Oh, that's the
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.760]   Apple case. Oh, it's spec. No, it's fine. It's I've showed it on other shows before. It just
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:25.400]   clicks right in. It's really nice. Andy, you're not co your picture. Actually, I have a
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:31.880]   mini pick and a major pick. The many one is for people who are actually listening live today.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:39.000]   We all know and love the snap seed photo editing app for iOS and the iPhone. Just really damn simple
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.200]   just to take any picture you've taken and just enhance it and make it nice to desktop quality,
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:49.880]   not even just mobile posting to Twitter quality. Snap seed is apparently is for free today.
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:55.400]   Oh, I love. Snaps. See it's free. The iPad app and the iPhone app go download for
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:02.520]   your next software. Well worth it. Yeah, run. I pay 10 bucks. Run. Yeah. So I believe that's
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.680]   today only. So if you're not listening to this on Valentine's Day, your heart is your heart is
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:14.120]   broken. But I have a couple but I have a really enthusiastic pick on the iOS and and Mac OS side.
[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:23.320]   It's I draw if it's by indio, if you go to I and D E E O dot com. And it is the closest thing I've
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:30.280]   ever found to an app that I've loved ever since like 1985 1986. It is a draw at this like it really
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:38.600]   is Mac draw for Mac OS Lion and for the iPad. It is a really cool sketch drawing app that allows you
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:43.800]   to draw vector graphics without necessarily being an architect without necessarily knowing what you
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:48.760]   want to accomplish and without necessarily having too much skill. But it will allow you to draw
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:56.600]   anything from like a floor plan to a book cover design to actual free form art.
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:04.520]   You can integrate pictures into it. It allows you to have multiple templates and multiple
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:10.280]   guidelines. Obviously the Mac OS version is a lot more has a lot more features than the
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:15.880]   than the iOS version. But the iOS if there's any sort of a regular drawing that you have to make,
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:20.760]   it allows you to build libraries not only of existing shapes that you've created and
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:27.560]   and thing them a bobs you've drawn, but also libraries of fills and and circles and things like
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:32.840]   that. So you can basically click on anything and suddenly have that really cool purple to blue
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:40.120]   starburst radiant effect with a drop shadow off of a black six point circle. So it's the it's it's
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:45.720]   the desktop version is 29 bucks so much cheaper than anything else that you can get for vector
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:51.880]   graphics so much easier than anything you can get on vector graphics. The iPad version is I believe
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:58.760]   899 and it's so it the two apps are really really very compatible. If you've learned how to use one
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:03.320]   the things you've learned how to create drawings and each on either app will translate very well
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:09.960]   to the other. And the more I use my iPad the more I come to value a tool that's available for both
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:16.200]   Mac OS and the iPad. I'm still trying really really hard not to buy a Mac book air no matter how much
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:19.800]   I love it no matter how much I love the compact size no matter how much I love having a Mac OS
[01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:24.760]   device that's that shape and that excuse me that's that small. I'm convinced that I find
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:30.680]   disciplined I can simply use my iPad as my field computer and not have to buy a third Macintosh
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:35.800]   just for the really tiny sort of Mac. So if you so you really cherish apps like I draw where you can
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:41.640]   have a version a separate version for iOS separate version for desktop but they're very very compatible
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:48.600]   not only with their files but also the way that they work. So it works it's it's the I draw for
[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:53.800]   the iPad I will also say that a lot of the reasons why I really have I feel I feel as though I have to
[01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.880]   take my Mac book with me when I'm only traveling for two days is because I'm flying somewhere to
[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:03.560]   give a talk or give a presentation and so many times I'll do my final run through of my slides
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:07.560]   that I before I'll realize that oh you know what I just read something two days ago that would make
[02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:12.280]   a really cool thing to add to this and I don't have the tools on my iPad to build that slide that I
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:20.120]   need with I draw it works actually almost looks so as though the same team that worked on keynote
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:24.920]   for the iPad developed this too I feel as though I can create any graphic any image that I would
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:29.960]   possibly need and because it's all vector graphics it'll scale up it'll scale down it'll rotate it'll
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:36.280]   be nice and smooth lines no matter what I do with it so great great apps I would have they gave me
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:40.840]   download codes but I would happily pay for them because because I've been using them so much over
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:45.560]   the past week or two that's neat I draw it's been a very expensive show for me did you buy that too
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:54.120]   $23 so far thank you very much and by the way the other program was snap seed
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:01:01.960]   SMAP SE it is so awesome finally your pick of the week mr. Alex Lindsay so I am picking a kickstarter
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:07.800]   project oh good so um because I want to see it get done so they just had their first million
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:12.200]   dollar project yeah this one's not a million dollar project yet but but it should be and you
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:19.080]   all should help so uh Tony Farley who is actually one of our oldest not oldest in age but longest
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:23.000]   pick score members is actually building an i-book an interactive physics i-book now he's a physics
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.240]   teacher at the San Leandro High School this is what you want this is this is what you want to see is
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:32.280]   you want to see teachers building these books you know not just not just big textbook companies
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:37.960]   and Tony is brilliant he is he's brilliant uh you know he's he's one of those teachers that makes a
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:41.960]   difference for his students um you know he's made a difference in the picks a core for a long time
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.240]   he didn't ask for a lot he only asked I know he didn't ask for enough I don't know what he I
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:49.000]   don't know what he was gonna do he's made his goal he's made his goal but we should keep on
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.720]   giving him funding because I can tell you I just know Tony well enough that whatever we pledge into
