[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.960]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.920]   This is Twit.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.760]   Bandwidth for MacBreak Weekly is provided by cashfly

[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.040]   This is MacBreak Weekly, episode 22 for January 3, 2007.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.520]   Here comes Macworld.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:50.440]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, and this is probably
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.920]   of all the MacBreak Weekly's all year
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520]   along the one you most want to listen to.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.600]   No, you might say, next week, that's
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720]   the one that we're going to do live from the Apple Store,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.800]   and we're going to know what Apple's announcing it,
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.600]   probably the most important announcement of the year,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.080]   et cetera.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.920]   But no, no, no.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.240]   You don't want to listen to that show.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.760]   This show, where we pretend we know what's going to happen,
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.360]   is going to be the most entertaining.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.600]   I am joined by three of our stalwarts, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.080]   Scott Born from the iLife Zone.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.320]   Hey, Scott.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.080]   Hi, Leo.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.640]   Did you get the tree out of your studio?
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.880]   Yeah, well, we're working on it.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.520]   Are you in your studio now?
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.600]   I'm in my new little home studio.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.320]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.720]   So this is like the portable that you're
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.440]   going to use until you get the big one rebuilt.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.720]   So people may not know you live in Seattle area and the storm.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.000]   I think I don't think the rest of the world, it was like Katrina.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.440]   But because it's a bunch of white guys drinking lattes,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.160]   nobody did anything about it.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.200]   Yeah, well, you see the thing is there were no Starbucks
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.840]   destroyed, so nobody cared.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.240]   I've got my Frappuccino Latte right in front of me,
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.480]   Merlin Mann of 43folders.com, the productivity guru,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.040]   and the man who introduced a whole generation of children
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.720]   to new ideas in sexual and propriety.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.400]   Last night.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.800]   You know, Leo, when kids get to a certain age,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.200]   all girls love horses.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.920]   And this is something that Freud talked about.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.200]   And I really just feel like when you're not here,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.520]   anything I can do to keep Alex on topic is a good thing.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.680]   So this is a clean show.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.320]   We believe the profanity-- or we don't do it,
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.920]   because we want kids to listen.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.480]   And Alex was editing, and something happened in the editing.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.200]   He says the edit slipped in time compared to the show.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.560]   I don't understand this audio stuff myself,
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.600]   but somehow the unbleed version got out.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.920]   Now, you quickly pulled it down.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.640]   Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Court, right?
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.040]   Yeah, we hear John Foster, I guess,
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   saw it within an hour or two.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.520]   He's quick.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.080]   Well, he does show notes, so he's quick.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.360]   Yeah, so he was doing show notes,
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.520]   and he immediately sent it to me.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.480]   So I very quickly just went up there and slammed it.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.440]   But it had gone to the feed.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.880]   It had gotten into the feed long enough
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.440]   so that there are now three or four sources
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.520]   for bootleg copies of Mac Break Weekly,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.720]   identical to the release version with one exception.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.520]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.480]   I think we've reached a new pinnacle
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.200]   when people are bootleg in our show.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.400]   We're actually talking now before the show we were talking,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.280]   and Scott Born wants to do Mac Break Weekly after Dark.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.600]   Scott Born wants to.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.400]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.080]   Who did I say wanted to do it?
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   It was somebody named his initials or Alex Lindsay.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.000]   Alex doesn't want to do it.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.840]   Scott Born wants to do it.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.680]   Well, there's a discussion.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.560]   There's a discussion that my Mac Break
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.080]   might be getting a little too long.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.600]   We are going to shorten it.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.440]   Yeah, we're going to shorten it.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.080]   We're going to snip it, if you will.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.840]   But we enjoy the banter at the very end.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.240]   We're going to save the tips.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.480]   And we'll put them together,
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.240]   so I'm going to make a suitcase later
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.480]   that we'll put on the air.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.520]   Exactly.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.080]   We're going to be doing that show live from Hooters.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.840]   Oh, no.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.920]   No.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.560]   You see, the other thing about this show,
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.720]   besides the fact that kids listen, is that adult women listen.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.960]   And I don't know about you, Scott,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.240]   but it's been my experience that they don't really take kindly
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.320]   to that kind of thing.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.840]   Not anymore.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.760]   Oh, geez.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.480]   All right, we're going to stick it to the Macs
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.800]   and stay away from the sexist comments here.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.160]   But anyway, we just wanted to let you know,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.920]   sorry about the little leak there,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.640]   and it was fixed very quickly.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.000]   And if you want to hear the unfixed version, it's out.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.480]   Now you're making it a thing.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.000]   Now people are going to get it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.200]   It's a thing now.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.520]   Listen, whatever you guys do, don't go look at that copy
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.000]   where we talk kind of dirty on there.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.640]   Seriously, unfixed Merlin man.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.280]   So let's get to the show at hand, which, of course, is--
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.560]   before we talk about Macworld, is there any other news
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.920]   in the Mac world?
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.200]   No.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.960]   Other than Macworld?
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.600]   Well, there's the whole thing, of course, floating.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.400]   Around Steve.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.200]   Oh, the options thing.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.440]   You want to talk about the options?
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.840]   Think didn't you do that last week?
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   I didn't listen.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.880]   I don't think we really--
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.760]   That broke right after the show.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.600]   So the story is, of course, that this
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.200]   is that options backdating scandal.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.080]   It's hit a lot of companies.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.360]   CNET's chairman of the board had to resign.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.240]   A lot of other companies--
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.160]   well, Fred Anderson, the former CFO at Apple,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.960]   had resigned from the board because of this backdating
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.280]   scandal.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.800]   But there was an internal investigation at Apple.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.040]   I love it, which has exonerated Steve Jobs.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.040]   He had nothing to do with it.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.800]   Well, OK, maybe he recommended, quote, favorable options
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.680]   dating.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.000]   I'm not sure how that differs from actually post dating,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.040]   but-- or predating.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.200]   Well, Leo, it's important to note that nothing they did
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   is illegal.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.480]   What the problem is is that you have to declare it,
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.920]   and that had not happened.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.520]   So it is a little unethical.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.760]   It may not be illegal, but it's a little unethical.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.440]   For those who don't know, when you
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.440]   go to work for a tech company-- many companies now,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.280]   but tech companies, I think, pioneered this notion--
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.040]   they give you some stock, but they don't just give you
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.880]   stock outright.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.360]   They give you an option to buy stock at a strike price.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.320]   That's the price that you will pay.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.760]   Now, if the stock goes up after you receive the option,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.280]   instant profit, if it goes down, it's worthless.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.840]   What they were doing is instead of normally the strike date
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.160]   is the date you get the option, which makes sense.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.640]   What they've been doing was backdating them
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.400]   to a more favorable time where the option price, the strike
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.920]   price, was lower.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.160]   And so if you backdate my stock option to a time when
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.440]   it was $3 and it's $5 today, I've got an instant profit of $2
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.560]   a share.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.920]   And so it may not be-- you have to disclose that, right, Scott?
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.160]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.920]   Actually, it's a completely legal process.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.600]   You can do it as often as you like.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.720]   It's done in corporations around the country.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.680]   What do you reserve a batch of it, right?
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.520]   At that time?
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.920]   The problem comes when you don't disclose it.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.360]   So what Apple did was they took an $84 million--
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.840]   $1 charge--
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.000]   which means they really like Steve Jobs.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.640]   And now it's OK.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.680]   Well, he only gets a buck a year, so it works out even.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.800]   I don't think he's hurting.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.280]   A buck a year old, and I've forgotten a big jet plane.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.480]   Well, I think that a lot of people
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.520]   are talking about this being some kind of big hoo-bitty hot.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.440]   And it looks like it's probably going to blow over number one.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.680]   And number two is, I think one of the things that's really
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.720]   important is whether as Apple stockholders--
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.400]   are the Apple stockholders really damaged
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.080]   by this whole process?
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.240]   I mean, theoretically they are.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.240]   But in actuality--
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.760]   They'd be most damaged by Steve Jobs losing his job.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.640]   Yeah, they'd be far more damaged by Steve Jobs
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.680]   having any kind of hiccup in his employment.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.720]   So do you think the vultures calling for his head
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.280]   are really iPod competitors who just want jobs out of there
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.880]   so they have a chance?
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.960]   Yes.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.840]   Nobody who really loves Apple wants Steve Jobs out.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.400]   Well, and I think that a lot of analysts
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.280]   would love to have a little controversy
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   to bring the stock.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.960]   This came up over the last week, too.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.280]   They'd love to see a little controversy
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.400]   to bring the stock down a little bit over a week or two
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.400]   so that we could buy it up.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:48.920]   Sure.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   So they could invest.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.560]   Because now is the time, right?
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.960]   You want to buy--
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.600]   what do you buy on the rumor, sell on the news?
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.040]   It's a little too late to buy on the rumor, I guess.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.560]   But you also got to imagine there's
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.680]   people out there who want to see Steve Jobs taking down
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.000]   a peg one way or another.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.600]   I mean, anybody who's got that kind of a cult of personality
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.800]   one way or another, people are always
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.200]   going to be taking hits that.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.720]   All right.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.960]   So I think that's one issue.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.840]   I think probably the tempest in a teapot, right?
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.360]   Not anything to worry about.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:18.760]   And it's--
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.800]   Unless it was more to the story, and we haven't heard,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.600]   unless there's more to the story, that's it.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.520]   The only thing that added to anything to the story--
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.680]   the only thing that was new was that Steve, quote unquote,
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.200]   hired on his own personal lawyer instead of just
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.120]   using the Apple lawyers.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.880]   I think that's what brought this back up in the courtroom.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.440]   Well, that's the right thing to do, though, don't you think?
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.960]   That's what I would do.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.280]   I don't want to have these corporate counsel.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.600]   We want to have a separate counsel just to make this all
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.400]   clean and legal.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.640]   So any other-- anything else happen
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.720]   that we should talk about before we get to our Mac world
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.160]   coverage?
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.160]   Maybe one quick thing.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.720]   I don't put a whole lot of stock in this,
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.760]   but it was kind of funny.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.840]   Mac Daily News reports showing a photograph at a Costco in--
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.320]   I saw that.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.880]   --Will Washington--
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.840]   --Huck Willows.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.920]   And if you go to Costco, you know this isn't a huge deal.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.800]   But apparently, they're using the cover for the palette
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.160]   that was meant to display Zunes to display Apple's iPod
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.000]   product.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.520]   They got a Zune base and a bunch of iPods.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.360]   Welcome to the social it says.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.080]   It could be worse.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.640]   It could be worse.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.440]   They could have an iPod base and a bunch of Zunes sit in there.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:21.840]   Right?
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.800]   So this is as close as the Zune is ever
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.960]   going to get to doing well with an iPod.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.200]   I got a lot of heat from my anti-Zune diatribe.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.000]   Well, and I think that this is an information week.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.320]   They were talking about the iTunes.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.760]   It sees a 1,222% traffic increase, according to HitWise.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.560]   Wow.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.000]   When?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.320]   From when to when this year?
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.400]   HitWise, which monitor is internet traffic friends,
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:53.680]   reported a, I guess, a 413% increase to iTunes on the holiday
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.320]   between 2006 and 2005.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.120]   OK, this time last year to this year.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.600]   All right.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.040]   And then the company attributed the growth
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.480]   to the new iPod ownership and reported the traffic increase
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.960]   to be 1,222% on Christmas compared to the previous Monday.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.640]   So between the two days.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.600]   But the next paragraph says that the Zune traffic was up
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.200]   1,000% over the same period.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.720]   It went from one to a thousand.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.680]   It went down loads to eight.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.120]   But the visit ratio between iTunes and Zune was 30 to one.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.960]   I know, you know, I just-- I don't understand why anybody, first
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.440]   of all, would want to defend the Zune.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.040]   They were accusing me of being a Mac fanboy and all that.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.040]   That's not that at all.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.480]   I mean, if it's a bad product, a bad product.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.960]   Well, and I have to admit that I would love
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.560]   to see something that was cheating heavily with an iPod,
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.960]   because it means we get more.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   So-- and I know Leo and I both.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.200]   I mean, we both-- I know when we saw it,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   we really wanted to--
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.760]   We liked it.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.480]   You know, we liked it.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.720]   We wanted to love it.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.960]   We wanted it to be successful.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.840]   Because it really needs to push Apple along.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.240]   The bottom line for me is this universal deal.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.200]   That was bad, Juju.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.320]   And they shouldn't have done it.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.800]   And Microsoft shouldn't have done it.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.480]   And it poisons the water for everybody else.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.760]   And you shouldn't support it by buying a Zune,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.880]   because you're saying, essentially, yeah,
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.120]   universal deserves some money, because I'm a pirate.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.840]   And I don't think that's the right message to send.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.320]   Right.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.280]   Well, here's the deal, Leo.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.680]   You go to Target.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.440]   There's a Target all over the place in almost every city.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.840]   And, you know, they're running low on iPod.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.720]   But boy, they got a bunch of Zunes for some.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.920]   You can get them.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.320]   Easy to get.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.760]   I think that that pretty much speaks for itself.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.800]   I mean, now, you know, if the Zune was that hot,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.120]   it'd be like the PlayStation 3.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.720]   You can't get them.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.680]   But they can't do anything to give them away.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.800]   So we all got this same email.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.680]   And I'm not going to give the author credit.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.240]   Because I don't know if I believe it.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.160]   He claims that he stopped by the plant
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.240]   where they print the banners for Macworld Expo.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.280]   Now, this has been in the past a great source
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.040]   for what's going to be announced, right?
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.320]   Because they kind of print those banners up.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.040]   That's one of the fun things about the Expo.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.320]   The banners are all covered as you go into the Steve keynote.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.080]   And they're uncovered as you leave.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.080]   And all of the, you know, ads for the new products are there.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.520]   First of all, are we all in agreement
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.080]   about what will be announced before I release the problems?
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.280]   Well, let's find out.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.960]   I bet we're in agreement about the stuff
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.800]   that's not going to be announced.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.160]   What's not going to be announced, Merlin Man?
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.920]   Well, let's start with some of the ones
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.440]   that won't get me hit by Scott.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.280]   (laughing)
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.240]   I would be kind of surprised if that thing
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.080]   was available for purchase at Macworld.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.920]   The iPhone.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.720]   The difference between being announced and being available.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   Okay.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   Right.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.160]   They'll say something about an iPhone.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.320]   I think they have to.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.760]   I think the ITV they've already said will be announced.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.720]   I think there's definitely, I mean, it just seems like,
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.360]   based on what I've been reading so far
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.560]   from the many different rumor sites
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.640]   that I can echo at this point,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.160]   it looks like there's got to be some kind of movement
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.000]   on the ITV because they have announced it.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   This is what Robert says.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.040]   This is the guy who sent us this note.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.600]   He said he got in the plant, he saw the banners.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.800]   There's a Mac Pro Octo, which I think is.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   I think that one's almost a given.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.000]   But will they announce it at Macworld
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.520]   or will they announce it some time later?
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.040]   Usually they don't announce the most of Macworld.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.120]   I think it's ready to be announced.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.960]   It's easy to do.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.360]   I mean, you could practically just take a pro
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.680]   and put in the new--
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.800]   Z of two way Zons and there you go.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.240]   I think they announced it because I think that there's no other
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.040]   really good pro event until NAB.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.680]   So I don't see it unless they announce it at NAMM the next week.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.440]   So that would be an eight-way eight processor Mac Pro.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.320]   We've got quads right now in these big Mac Pros.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.040]   Now they'll have octos.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.480]   And the big question will be whether they do any kind of redesign
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.880]   to the motherboard to make sure that there's enough bandwidth
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.120]   going into those eight processors.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.960]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.640]   I don't think I use my quad chips thoroughly.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.880]   Because of the IO model.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.560]   So that bottleneck may prove to be problematic unless they
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.480]   redo some pieces in there.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.320]   So that's going to be-- but I think
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.240]   that they have to announce it soon.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.120]   I mean, those processors are really
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.400]   kind of floating around in the wild now.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.520]   And Octo would be a good name for it.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.240]   And Leo, I just got an email a couple hours
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.480]   before we went to record this.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.760]   And it said, "Dear Scott, I understand
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.720]   that Leo recently purchased a quad for, therefore,
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.520]   I am guaranteeing that there will be an octo so much so
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.160]   that I'm naming my son Octo when he's born next year."
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.760]   Octo-- the only problem is that it reminds me
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.480]   of the Spider-Man villain Doc Ock.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.080]   But other than that, I think it's a good name.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.600]   Maybe Ock--
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.800]   I think they should call it.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.120]   I vote for Crazy Aids.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.600]   Crazy Aids, baby.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.920]   So that was the most credible.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.320]   Now here's the other thing Robert says.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.840]   He says, "There will be an iPhone, but it's going to be called.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.360]   Are you ready?
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.760]   The iChat mobile."
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.080]   You just credited him.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.600]   Yeah, I don't buy it at all.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.240]   I think I don't believe the i's going to be there.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.120]   Well, in fact, I'm going to play in a second.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.040]   I did have another informant call the radio show on Sunday.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.280]   And he was very credible.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.440]   And that's one of the things he said.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.400]   There will not be an i in the name of the phone.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.600]   He said, "The phone wouldn't come out.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.480]   I'm going to play a cut so you can hear what he says."
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.560]   All right, so we're agreed that there will be an iPhone
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.760]   of some kind.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.040]   Maybe not available.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.440]   Maybe not available.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.520]   I think that was kind of a mundane agreement.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.120]   I didn't hear a lot of cheering.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.360]   Scott, you cheer enough for all of us.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.000]   OK, let's talk about the displays.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.640]   Is everybody agree there's going to be new displays?
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.280]   Really?
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.720]   Bigger than 30?
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.000]   Well, I'm not saying big.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.200]   But I noticed about a week ago that the iSight
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.640]   went off of the Apple Store.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.560]   You can't find them there.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.360]   You can't find them.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:36.920]   No more iSight.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.240]   There might be a new iSight.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.080]   Mine is figuring--
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.600]   So I'm figuring--
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.080]   They're great?
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.040]   I'm figuring it's going to be built into the display
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.040]   like it is on the MacBook Pro.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.640]   New cinema displays with an iSight built in.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.760]   I think that the two things that you could do to cinema
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.800]   is without really changing them much at all.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.000]   Would be to A, give them an iSight and B, to add HDMI in.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.680]   Because that makes them actually TVs.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.400]   Yeah, well, in fact, Dell does a better job, frankly,
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.760]   than Apple at the big displays because they have component
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.240]   and HDMI and S-video into these displays.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.360]   They have memory card readers and they're cheaper
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.560]   than what Apple's doing.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.000]   I would hate to see the iSight go away.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.680]   Because if you use anything like a delicious library
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.480]   or something like that for scanning stuff, it's a lot easier.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.720]   I bought one of those little Griffin microphone extender
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.480]   things that lets you scoot your iSight around however you want.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.360]   And I love that.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.280]   I like having it built into the MacBook Pro,
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   but I don't know if it's optimal for everybody.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.000]   You know, you can just use a DV camcorder, though.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.560]   Right.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.040]   And I'll tell you what I've done is with video queue.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.280]   It's a great way to do a multi-camera setup on the cheap.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.560]   Also, our friends at MacRumors think that this is actually
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.440]   a coordinated disinformation effort.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.280]   That there won't be a new video display.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.240]   That new display is they're saying that the TANBY claims
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.960]   that they represent a coordinated effort
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.120]   to intentionally spread false information.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.360]   So I don't know if they're just, you know,
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.640]   salting the ground here, but that's their opinion.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.800]   Well, it could be that there's just going to be a new iSight,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.480]   but it seems to me more likely that they put it into the display.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.280]   And I agree with Alex, we really need HDMI coming into that thing.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.880]   And if we get it, then people like me are going to buy it.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.880]   Well, here's a lot of things.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.840]   How about Blu-ray for the computers?
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.560]   And then with an HDMI connector, you could watch HD movies.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.840]   But you have to have a digital connection.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.760]   Don't you have to have an HDMI connection to use HDCP,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.600]   the copy protection?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.880]   Other than the crack, right?
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.000]   So, yeah.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.400]   But as long as you're not on Windows.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.720]   Isn't that the problem with that?
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.240]   When we're talking about that, isn't that the problem with Vista?
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.440]   Don't you get some concerns?
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.280]   It doesn't work with that?
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   Yeah, no.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.040]   Is that correct, Alex?
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.160]   That you can get some interference, the DRM?
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.680]   I don't know.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   It's Windows.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.200]   Stop me from talking out of my butt and tell me how to do it.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.600]   I have no idea.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.320]   There's a whole-- we'll actually listen to the Windows--
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.200]   That's our Windows weekly.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.320]   Yeah, if you want to hear about that,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.880]   there's a lot to say about that.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.160]   Yeah, Merlin, there's a show called Windows Weekly.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.080]   Windows Weekly.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.880]   There's an operating system called Windows.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.760]   You may have heard of it, but don't worry.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.720]   It's not really for instance.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.600]   This is why it's funny.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.000]   This is why it's funny when people call me a quote unquote
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.920]   "Mac fanboy."
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.720]   What do you want me to do?
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.800]   It's like me learning Esperanto.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.200]   I don't even own a PC.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.840]   Why Esperanto fanboy?
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.640]   I know it.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.080]   So one good use for the eyesight camera.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.640]   Amber MacArthur told me about this.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.240]   It's a program called Dream Recorder
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.440]   that you actually sleep with your laptop,
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.960]   and you turn the eyesight on, and it records movement,
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.760]   and then it plays music appropriate,
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.200]   and then it wakes you up when it notices you're awake,
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.560]   instead of waking you up.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.560]   It's really bizarre.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.040]   It's typical European pizziz-like software,
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.880]   but I thought you'd like this.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.040]   That is software for people who are not married.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.160]   Yeah, well, that's-- in fact, if you read the FAQ,
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.440]   it says, well, what if I have somebody in bed with me?
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.160]   They say, well, first of all, congratulations.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.680]   Second of all, our software won't work.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.120]   So it's pretty funny anyway.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.040]   It's dream-recorded.com.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.240]   That is not my software pick.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.640]   So I'll play some stuff for the iPhone,
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.720]   but let's go through the other stuff.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.640]   ITV will be out.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.720]   According to Robert, it's going to be called the iMix.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.680]   I-M-M-I-X, which would come as a great surprise
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.480]   to the iMix company, which makes video editing software
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.640]   for that kind of stuff.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.600]   They'll probably be just a little bit paid over it,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.240]   don't you like?
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.760]   To me, that discredited the whole message right there.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.560]   It's like, nah, I don't think this is true.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.920]   Alex posted something from Apple Insider
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.680]   about some problems with rumored problems
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.440]   with quality assurance on that.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.800]   On the ITV--
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.400]   Yeah, the room.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:29.960]   Go ahead.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.640]   Go ahead, Merlin.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.400]   Oh, no, I'm reading off the page you posted.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.160]   Well, the number is that they're still refining the OS
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.760]   that's going to actually run the ITV device.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.800]   And so they may be able to announce it and talk about it,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   but there's rumors that they won't ship it.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.200]   I bet if there's an issue, it's that it's 802.11 and is not
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.280]   yet ratified.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:51.720]   And it's--
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.560]   That's it right there.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.080]   It's going to have to have an, right?
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.280]   They put an--
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.680]   in all the new Intel hardware.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.360]   It depends on what kind of operating system
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.360]   they're going to actually put into the operating system.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.000]   I doubt they put the Mac in, but something that's
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.280]   good enough to run a front row like interface.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.720]   Well, the rumors are that they're really
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.840]   trying to put a strip down OSX in it.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   So we'll see how far they go with that.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.720]   That's interesting.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.160]   So you want to hear what this guy said about the iPhone?
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:17.640]   Sure.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.600]   He knew what he was talking about.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.200]   Well, let me play it for you.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.160]   I should cut string beans and a ball for you.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.960]   K-F-I-A-M640, more stimulating talk radio.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.680]   Leo LaPorte, the tech guy on KFI, 1126.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.800]   Well, you know, it is the year end show,
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.120]   and predictions are important.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.760]   And I'd like to hear your predictions, 1-800-5-201-KFI.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.160]   I've got Victor on the line from Wichita, who
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.600]   swears to me that he knows what Apple is going to do
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.480]   with the iPhone.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.720]   It won't be called-- we know it won't be called the iPhone
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.400]   because Link says it announced an iPhone.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.600]   Hey, Victor.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.120]   Hello.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.440]   I'm not going to put you on this spot.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.760]   I'm not going to ask you where you got this information.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.200]   OK.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   But you believe this to be accurate.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:00.760]   I do.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.120]   I have a close friend that works at Apple in this department,
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.040]   so I believe it to be true.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.920]   Yes.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.960]   You're getting this guy fired, dude.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.200]   No, I'm not going to tell it a name.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   I was trying--
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.560]   I mean, John.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.400]   I was trying to get you off the hook.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.360]   But no, you said-- you went for it.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:14.800]   All right.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.520]   So what do you know?
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.440]   Now, remember everybody, take this with a grain of salt.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.600]   But what do you know, Victor?
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.120]   Yeah, of course.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.680]   I'm taking it with a grain of salt as well.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.520]   But what would you like to know, Leo?
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.960]   Well, first of all, will it be announced at Macworld Expo
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.160]   in a couple of weeks?
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:28.960]   I believe so.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.680]   The only thing that's keeping it from being announced
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.040]   is problems with carrier agreements.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   So they aren't going to do it on the phone?
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.480]   They are not going to do an unlocked phone.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.600]   They're going to do a phone that will be
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.040]   with a specific provider.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.560]   Yes.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.640]   That's kind of a surprise.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.960]   The phone itself-- the hot topic is
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.000]   whether the phone will be GSM or CDMA.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.640]   Right.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.400]   And I can tell you that it's going to be CDMA.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.560]   What's positive there?
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.120]   Comments.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   So CDMA means that it's Verizon or--
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.080]   Does Sprint actually do CDMA as well?
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.160]   At least so.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.360]   But that would eliminate singular and T-Mobile.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.400]   More than that, it's most of the world, too.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.800]   Doesn't it eliminate the international audience?
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.160]   Yes.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.080]   I'm fine with Verizon.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.840]   I got Verizon.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.600]   Works for me.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.640]   They have to-- apparently they're struggling a little bit
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.560]   on the contract with Verizon, according to this guy.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.640]   Or with somebody?
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.160]   With somebody.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.000]   He didn't say Verizon.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.400]   But his CDMA-- now that's a direct comprehension
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.280]   to what Kevin Rose said, he said it'll be both GSM
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.200]   and CDMA unlocked.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.680]   But that didn't make sense at all, frankly.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.280]   Or be great if it--
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.400]   Or maybe what that means is it has the capacity
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.000]   to be unlocked later on down the road.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.720]   Verizon does sell one phone.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.680]   I looked into this.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.720]   That is both CDMA and GSM.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.320]   Really?
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.800]   So it is possible.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.880]   I mean, sure it's much more expensive,
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.840]   because you have to put two radios in and everything.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.520]   Right.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.440]   But you know why I think CDMA is credible
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.080]   is because of Edge.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.000]   Edge is too slow.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.160]   EVDO is much faster.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.440]   They're going to want to go with a faster 3G network,
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.760]   so they can, what, sell music, right?
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.240]   And they just-- Verizon just upgraded the EVDO service
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.360]   in 10 major cities.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.000]   Right.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.520]   And it's fast.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   It's really fast.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.320]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.360]   I actually use both.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.920]   I have a singular phone, a T-Mobile phone,
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.440]   and a Verizon phone.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.560]   And I guess I'm getting a new Verizon phone too,
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.480]   because, well, you got to try them all, you know?
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.600]   No, you get the Apple iPhone.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.440]   Leo, you will never need another phone.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:28.960]   All right.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.480]   That's my prediction.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.880]   Let me play-- well, I'll tell you what.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.360]   I won't play it.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.320]   I'll just tell you what he said.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.440]   This is the most interesting thing.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.600]   It'll be made of zirconium.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.440]   I think that's awesome.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.600]   That's the clear stuff?
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.440]   The fake diamond ring stuff?
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.520]   That was my first-- you mean cubic zirconium?
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.960]   So I looked it up on Wikipedia.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.720]   Zirconium is like titanium.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.960]   Well, it has one minor flaw.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   It does tend to burst into flame, kind of like magnesium.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.880]   As long as you keep it at under 30 degrees Fahrenheit,
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.360]   it's fine.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.800]   Don't put it in the sun.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.880]   No, but there are zirconium-based ceramics
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.480]   that would actually make excellent cell phone material
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.440]   because it's radio transparent.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.120]   Cool.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.280]   They're very hard.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:16.440]   They're actually used in hip replacements.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.040]   Are they less scrunchable?
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.880]   Abrasion resistant-- this is what Wikipedia says.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.400]   This would be a zirconium metal alloyed with niobium.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.160]   They oxidize it to produce an abrasion resistant high
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.480]   integrity ceramic surface.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.800]   Doesn't wear, doesn't scratch.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.280]   Highly durable, non-corrosive radio transparent.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.680]   It actually sounds like the perfect cell phone material.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.560]   I haven't been this excited since I found my dad's playboy
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.880]   when I was 12.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.560]   I knew you'd like this.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.480]   And I have to say, after talking to this guy for a while,
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.000]   there's quite a bit more-- if you want to hear more,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.360]   you can hear the KFI podcast.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.680]   But this guy, he sounded very credible.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.720]   I feel bad for his friend.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.760]   I don't think he realized what the jeopardy he's putting his
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.440]   friend in.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.520]   Yeah, there's only probably six people at Apple
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.240]   that know this about the phone.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.640]   Yeah, and that's a very short list that he's just created.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.400]   He had letting that stuff out.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:07.760]   He can--
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.840]   So on Monday, there were all these jackbooted stormtroopers
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.000]   running down the hall.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.240]   Well, the problem is is that they may all just get--
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.680]   Anybody on that short list would all get let go.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.040]   Well, who knows?
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.880]   Anyway, I hope that's not the case.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.000]   He did confirm what Kevin said, which was that there
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.720]   would be four and eight gigabyte models.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.000]   He's pricing, though, was much more sensible.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.160]   I don't remember the exact details,
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.600]   but it was like $2.80 for the four gigabyte and $3.30
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   for the eight gigabyte, very reasonably priced.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.000]   I'm bargain at twice the price.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.520]   I would say so.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:45.320]   He said it will have Bluetooth 2 with enhanced data rate,
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.720]   PDR, which is supported by the new Macs.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.200]   That's good.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.560]   It means cable free syncing.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.480]   Wi-Fi?
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.760]   Wi-Fi.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.880]   And PDA capability have seamless eyesink support in Leopard.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.760]   Now, you know, this just makes me want to recall for everybody
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.040]   the fact that I was the first person who was really excited.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.600]   It's not going to be there.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.800]   I still don't believe it.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.320]   You don't believe it.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   GPS.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:09.840]   I don't.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.160]   It's any more--
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.120]   Didn't mention GPS.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.520]   But if you're going to put Wi-Fi in, it almost--
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.120]   You know, they should also do a form and grill in it,
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.040]   maybe put in a waffle maker.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.120]   I want a laser pointer.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.720]   A laser pointer is easy.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.400]   We can do that.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.680]   You know, it does have a built-in hooters detector.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.320]   Back to the gutter again.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.760]   You're going to get a timeout, Scott.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.520]   Back to the gutter.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.920]   Now listen, I tell you, they're going to announce it.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.400]   It's all right.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.480]   They're going to announce it.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.720]   They may not ship it.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.200]   Well, and that's kind of what this guy was saying is that--
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.840]   this is the thing that really took me a while
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.160]   to believe the phone because I didn't think Apple would ever
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.960]   want to get in bed with somebody like Verizon.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.400]   Well, once again, our friends at MacRumors
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.240]   have taken the time to do some meta rumor research
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.760]   on the more reputable sites.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.720]   And the quote from them is that the launch date--
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.640]   many New Zealanders are pointing toward Macworld
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.760]   as the launch date.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.000]   And in italics, none of the more credible rumors
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.200]   has specifically pointed to Macworld
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.520]   as the launch date for the device.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.400]   So yeah, they may-- here's the thing
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.880]   that I'm thinking about is if the ITV is not ready,
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.120]   if they can't just go up there and announce a bunch of dates,
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.920]   that's not very sexy.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.920]   I would love to hear from you guys
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.440]   that based on what you know, what is the thing?
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440]   What's the big closer?
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.080]   One word--
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.440]   leopard.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.600]   You'll come over with it.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.200]   Ready to buy?
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.160]   They're going to put leopard out.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:30.920]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:35.080]   First of all, has anybody been in touch with developers?
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.080]   Leopard was fairly mature when they put it out at WWDC.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.800]   And it looks like it's getting pretty--
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.880]   I think it's pretty mature.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.440]   I haven't talked to anybody who's got a recent bill,
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.200]   but I think it's pretty mature.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.040]   I'm under NDA.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.880]   I can't say any more.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.520]   Oh, you bastard.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:48.960]   You practically--
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.160]   Now you're under NDA.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.960]   You practically killed Kenny.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.040]   So here's the other thinking.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.000]   And I can't claim credit for this.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.120]   I think it was Sean Carrothers, who I work with on Call for Help,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.080]   who suggested this line of logic.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.400]   Wouldn't it be great to get it out two weeks before Vista ships?
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.840]   Ooh.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.800]   Well, that would be sometime in 2009, right?
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.560]   No, Vista's coming out January 30th.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.480]   Would you like some of these--
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.760]   As my son would say, would you like some ice for that burn?
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.800]   Where did we hear that?
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.560]   We hear that it was going to come after Vista.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.760]   Was that not the--
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.720]   Apple said we're not going to put this out.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.880]   Disinformation.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.840]   That's how they get you.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.600]   I'm telling you, it would be--
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.760]   Now, there's the stroke, right?
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.720]   You say, well, you're going to have a phone.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.600]   You're going to love it.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.080]   He shows it.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.480]   Available January.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.360]   April, February, who knows?
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.560]   We're going to have this great ITV.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.200]   We talked about it.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.920]   We're going to call it the--
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.320]   And you're going to love it.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.800]   March.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.320]   Oh, and one more thing.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.200]   There is one thing you can have today.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.680]   Besides, obviously, I life 07 and I work 07.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.120]   There's something you can have today.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.520]   Leopard.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.120]   Wouldn't that do it?
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:28:59.960]   That'd be pretty good.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.200]   I think he really wants to walk up there.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.680]   It would be so cool to end up by pulling a phone out of his pocket
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   and calling John Mayer or John Hodgman or something.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.120]   That would be really slick.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.560]   I bet that's what they'd really loved.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.160]   I'm going to allow it.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.680]   That's what they want, but I don't know if they--
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.480]   Do you think Hodgman will be on the stage with Steve?
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.520]   I bet he will.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.360]   I think he should have a while there.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.720]   I have faith that our listeners have engaged
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.600]   in the letter writing campaign I asked for,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.360]   and they're going to bring me up on stage.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.760]   Hey, now, we've gotten so excited about the cell phone.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.000]   Do we think that there's going to be a larger iPod that
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.800]   is available or do we think it's part of the cell phone?
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.400]   I mean--
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.720]   Well, that would be a new iPod, wouldn't it?
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.200]   You think they're due?
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.760]   Leo, didn't you say you were front ready?
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.320]   They're overdue.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.880]   When was the video I put on?
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.920]   I am dying here.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.760]   That was more than a year ago.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.000]   Yeah, I'm dying here.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.800]   That's all I've got to say.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.440]   My screen is all scratched up now.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.240]   I need a new one.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.080]   No, it's time.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.520]   Have you guys seen the teaser on the website?
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.560]   The first 30 years were just the beginning.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.560]   Welcome to 2007.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.800]   No, that's on Apple.com.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.560]   That's the front page.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.680]   That's the new teaser.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.960]   And remember, they did this, I don't know, a couple years ago
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.680]   when they were going to announce something.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.880]   And they changed it every couple of days
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.000]   right before Macworld.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.280]   Do you think this is the biggest announcement
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.360]   we've seen at Macworld?
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.680]   Do you think we're going to see stuff that's of that import?
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.880]   Well, if we see the phone, that's
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.640]   going to make it the biggest thing in the universe.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.720]   I think there's an old--
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:26.800]   There's an old--
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.440]   --sepscot.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.200]   Anybody have a phone?
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.400]   There's an old magic trick that you guys probably know
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.520]   about where you're able to answer a question from somebody.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.320]   And you say, oh, well, to get your answer,
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.320]   go over and lift that paperweight.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.000]   And of course, the person's answer is under there.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.200]   Of course, they have answers hidden in 50 places
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.240]   all over the room.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.400]   So there's a million ways that you can make the trick work.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   I'm going to get drummed out of the--
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.800]   Is that how they do that?
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.800]   That's how they do it.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.320]   I saw it on Colombo.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.760]   And so I wonder sometimes when I see these things like these--
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.240]   You better keep watching, because something exciting
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.880]   is going to happen.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.240]   Over there, look over there.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.040]   Just sweating bullets up until the last minute about--
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.360]   You know Steve has super over rehearsed
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.240]   on 85% of his presentation.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.520]   But then there's going to be the one bit where--
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.040]   I don't know.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.960]   I wonder if they're working up to the last minute on that.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.040]   Oh, you know they've got to be.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:14.680]   How is it, though?
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.200]   We've got three of the top Mac journalists in the world here.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.600]   And then one guy is under NDA.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   How is it--
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.640]   I'm going to start using that.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.720]   I'm teasing.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.560]   But seriously, how is it none of us
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.400]   have any inside information about this?
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.880]   Well, there's this thing called Apple Secrecy, which I recall.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   We all had a discussion about a few months ago,
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.840]   and everybody said they liked it.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.040]   They're tough.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   And I have to admit, I don't even try anymore.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.640]   I mean, I look at what everybody else is doing here.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.560]   And the problem is that I feel guilty.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.320]   I don't talk to a guy from Apple,
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.520]   and I'll ask him a question like that.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.000]   And he gives you that puppy dog look.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.280]   And I just feel terrible for even asking.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.120]   Well, I don't ask him--
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.040]   They want to tell you.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.840]   I mean, I've been to parties and talk to people
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.360]   way, way, way deep background off the record.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.800]   And even-- and of course, I never
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.760]   want to put anybody in a position where they can get
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.560]   steaved.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.480]   But at the same time, I'll say something like, you know,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.040]   if I was to set my drink down and walk away,
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.160]   and I came back and it was moved an inch,
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.720]   I might know that it's a bad time to buy a power book.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.760]   Does that work?
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.600]   No.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.680]   Was your answer under the drink?
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.560]   I did have one conversation with the guy
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.040]   when I was getting ready to buy a power book that
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.560]   went along those lines.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.160]   And I still-- and he kept saying, just wait three more
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.960]   months, and it's going to be worth it.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.120]   And I still don't know what it was that I was supposed
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.160]   to be waiting for.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.600]   Well, see, that's the other thing that happens
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.560]   is they don't know sometimes.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.680]   And they'll give you stuff that they think
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.080]   is going to come out, and it doesn't come out.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:38.680]   I think--
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.520]   I know something we haven't talked about.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:40.880]   What?
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.520]   We haven't talked about the new spreadsheet.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.240]   You think there's a new spreadsheet?
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:46.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.920]   Well, that would be the new-- that would be an update to I work.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.400]   There's no spreadsheet.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.840]   There's going to add a spreadsheet component
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.040]   is what I'm saying.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.440]   You know, that's kind of the piece that really
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.720]   is missing from any attempt to do an office that's not
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.240]   Microsoft on the Mac.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.320]   That's the killer app.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.920]   There's nothing.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.440]   Excel owns that space so utterly and totally.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.600]   But you know, it owns it for good reason.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   Once you learn Excel, there's a real disadvantage.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   But it says it is an--
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:13.960]   But it is an--
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.120]   I think that there is a lot of opportunity there
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.400]   to add an Excel--
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.080]   an Excel-like experience without quite the complexity.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.560]   There's Google's spreadsheet.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:20.960]   I don't know.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.720]   Do you want to go up to that?
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.480]   Microsoft and Google?
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.160]   But I think that there's a--
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.840]   it would be nice to make it a little easier.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.880]   Not online.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.840]   I mean, you can't say that pages is an actual word processor.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.000]   Pages is so far from a word processor.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.680]   So you think it'll be--
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.240]   It's more of a page makeup product.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.520]   It'll be a page-like spreadsheet.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.720]   Yeah, it's going to be a--
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.600]   It's not going to be like Excel in terms of its power.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.080]   It'll be more of an iLife.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.800]   It'll be like everything else in the iLife Suite.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.760]   It'll be simplified.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.720]   It'll be easy to use.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.440]   You'll be good for 80% to 90% of the people who need something.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.000]   And it'll be a perfect complement to keynote and pages
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.080]   in the rest of the iLife Suite.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.000]   Excel is way overkill for what I didn't like.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.360]   Well, when they first announced Safari, which I think
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.160]   was at a Mac world probably what was that two or three years ago.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.680]   And I remember thinking, oh, great.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.440]   That's brilliant.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.120]   Yeah, Apple needs to put out a browser.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.200]   That's a great idea.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.280]   And I remember thinking that was the stupidest idea in the world.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.560]   I was like, we've got browsers.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.040]   They work.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.160]   You've got, at the time, I think Mozilla was what I was using.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.520]   And I thought that's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.280]   And now I love Safari.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.840]   So there's a part of me that has learned to kind of think,
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.520]   well, I love Excel.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.280]   I live in Excel.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.960]   Excel is, for most people, the killer app.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.720]   Whenever you need to do something to build something--
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.320]   Well, OK, so you're in Excel for that.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.040]   I saw someone.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.200]   Would you consider changing to something else?
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.880]   I mean, don't you know it so well that it's--
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.720]   Excel is--
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.120]   That's not who they're marketing to.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.320]   They're marketing to the people who
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.280]   think that they want to build a spreadsheet and then open up
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.240]   Excel and go, well, that's true.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.880]   Excel is one of those apps like Photoshop.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.840]   It's way beyond your burrito 80/20.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.240]   Well, frankly, that's why I use Google
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.560]   spreadsheet all the time for that reason.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.920]   It's very straightforward.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.920]   But I use maybe a few functions.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.080]   I'll use a little dollar signs to fix one cell
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.480]   as the variable for something.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.280]   But apart from that, I'm not just so much stuff
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.640]   I'm not doing with macros and all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.160]   Oh, it's very cool.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.160]   And it takes a long time to start up.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.200]   And it's kind of weird looking.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.480]   So it's not for the business market.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.000]   It's for the casual home user who is going to put together
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.320]   a baseball schedule order.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.440]   Or to be honest with you, the salesperson who doesn't
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.160]   want to know how to do everything there is to do,
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.320]   but does want to put together a graph.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.480]   And like all of my work, it would be presentation focused,
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.040]   probably.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.000]   And either great with keynote and pages.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.880]   Yeah, it wouldn't look-- it wouldn't dorky like Excels.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.320]   It sounds like Claris works.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.960]   Seriously.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.440]   I mean, why didn't Apple just keep Apple works alive?
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.760]   I mean, it was missing--
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.880]   It got into the point where it didn't get to fall behind.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.400]   Yeah, but couldn't you fix it?
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.480]   I think that's the funny part is that Office--
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.960]   I mean, it's so funny to me, Office got as almost as good
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.520]   as it was ever going to get, I think about 1990.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.040]   Then they released that, was it, version 7?
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.080]   They installed like 30 extensions.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.720]   And then it's all been downhill since then.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   It's gotten a little bit better.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.080]   You know, I have to say, Office 2007
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.760]   is the first significant improvement to Office,
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.680]   literally since probably you're right, the four or five
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.320]   versions.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.160]   And it's really good.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.400]   And when it comes out on the Mac, you are going to want it.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.520]   I really think.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.400]   I didn't really-- for the average person,
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.920]   I don't think-- and for a long time
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.680]   when I was working by myself, I mean, text that it was enough.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.440]   I do find that when we're going back and forth between our PR
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.600]   firm a lot of times and also with--
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.240]   when we're going back and forth with magazines,
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.960]   I am finding that I've gotten addicted to the revisioning
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   within Word.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.040]   Yeah, Word's great for that.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.440]   That you just have all the tracking and all the stuff
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.200]   that was deleted.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.440]   I'm curious what you guys will think.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.520]   But I think the best Word processor ever on the Mac,
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.120]   Word Perfect 5.1, was it 5.1?
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.880]   It was awesome.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.600]   I thought it was a huge fan of Word 5.1 was the best.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.760]   I was a big fan of right now.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.600]   I loved right at the time.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   Yeah, whatever.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.440]   Right now, that was good.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.640]   Right now was so simple.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.760]   You just go and it was kind of like Mac right,
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.840]   but a little bit more--
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.200]   Yeah, right now was right.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.400]   But Word Perfect-- man, Word-- maybe it was Word Perfect 3.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:03.760]   I think that's--
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.120]   Was that the kind of DOS looking one?
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:05.560]   It was real--
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.480]   No, no, no.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:11.720]   It was the first really powerful Word processor on them.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.000]   It was truly good.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.920]   And it was-- and never again was it as good.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.840]   Alas.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.680]   I remember thinking when I was trying to decide,
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.280]   well, I was so--
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.440]   I started to write my undergrad thesis in 1988 or '89.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.360]   And I remember thinking, OK, I got to make a decision
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.680]   about how I'm going to use this, because I have only
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.480]   have so many of these 800K disks to deal with.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.640]   And I remember thinking, like, the siding
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.200]   between Microsoft Word and I did look at Word Perfect,
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.000]   and I was like, you know what?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.320]   I'm going to stick with right now.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.600]   And I think to this day, I'm sitting here
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.680]   and trying to think of stuff.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.280]   Apart from HTML, I don't think there's that much
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.600]   that I use in Word or for that matter of text edit
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.640]   that I would need beyond what was in right now.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.520]   You know, for Word processing, it's all I need.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.440]   3.0, I miss Wordstar myself.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.560]   Word was Word Perfect 3.5.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.080]   And I think that there are people out there
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.280]   who will back me up on this, that there was just never a better--
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.920]   you can actually still buy it on Amazon.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.520]   Leo, there's a lot of nostalgia for those old Word processors.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.120]   Yeah, well, because he spent a lot of time in there, right?
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.440]   Full screen mode and full screen mode.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.720]   The whole idea with the kind of reversed out text,
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   that's gotten a lot of people out.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.120]   You can say I have Mel L. Wright, Mariner Wright, Nisis,
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.920]   and Pages.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.120]   And none of them really--
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.520]   I guess I use Nisis more than anything else.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.560]   I think text edit is great.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.800]   I still use the right room since I discovered it
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.440]   a few weeks ago.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.920]   Yeah, right room's pretty.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.520]   What do you need?
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.200]   I'm always curious what people are actually
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.320]   using in Word processors.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.800]   I mean, I need spell check.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.400]   And that's about it.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.320]   Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.000]   I'm writing a big, long treatment
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.280]   and a bunch of information for the--
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.360]   because revamping call for help.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.520]   And what am I writing it in?
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.680]   At first, I started in Word processors.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.080]   I said, wait a minute.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.280]   No, I'm writing it in a wiki.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.840]   It just showed you.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.560]   You just check out my pick from last week, that apps
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.040]   grivener.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.400]   Because it's got a really sensible way
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.840]   to kind of organize your thoughts inside of the actual
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.360]   document as index cards.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.480]   And then move that around.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.960]   And index cards actually become the thing that you're writing.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.160]   It's really cool.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.040]   So it's not really a word processor.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.320]   It's more of an idea process.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.160]   It's a lot like these kind of emerging--
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.880]   a lot of these-- I'm kind of repeating myself from last week.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.560]   But a lot of these emerging kind of next generation
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.760]   word processing apps that--
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.320]   Well, yeah, I don't want to read you to repeat yourself.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.800]   But I'll take a look at it.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.720]   I'll take a look at it.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.560]   Scrivener.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.520]   I'll give you a little--
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.080]   Before we move on, because we have a couple of things
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.240]   we want to do because it is our first podcast of the year.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.440]   But any thoughts, additional thoughts
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.720]   about announcements at Macworld, anything that-- maybe--
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.840]   any surprises, anything that we haven't thought of?
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.880]   I think that's--
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.760]   I think it's going to be less than the rumors.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.840]   And there are so many rumors that I have no new laptops.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.480]   You're not going to see it a little tiny laptop.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.680]   We might see some revs.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.200]   PDA?
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.280]   My system revs of laptops.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.040]   I think if there's a PDA, it's going
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.400]   to be this super iPod cell phone thing that you can write on.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.720]   I mean, I think that there's a possibility
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.200]   that this could be a lot more than a phone.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.840]   I think basically, I do think Apple's going to market it
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.120]   as an iPod with phone capabilities.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.920]   And if they go far enough, I think
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.240]   we can end up seeing something that really is halfway
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.920]   between an iPod and a Newton and everything else.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.120]   And so I don't think Apple's interested
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.360]   in getting it to the cell phone market.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.400]   So I think that what they need to do
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.440]   is do something that's going to be a lot bigger than just
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.640]   a cell phone or just an iPod.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.320]   And so I think we could see some more PDA capabilities.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.560]   But I think it would be inside of that if it happens.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.360]   If there's an I, whatever phone, I'm
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.160]   going to use mine to call Scott and sing him an apology
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.280]   for being so broad.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.600]   And we'll be there to record it.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   Sorry.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.200]   [LAUGHING]
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.640]   Here's what we got to do, Merlin.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.920]   If there's an iPhone--
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.760]   I'll call you on stage when you're up with you.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.840]   You have to agree to write a commercial for it.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.920]   Oh, that's good.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.720]   I would be happy.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.320]   I'd like to see that.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:54.760]   OK.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.320]   Let me ask--
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:55.960]   And record it.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.520]   I'll record it.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.920]   Well, if it turns out, well, Merlin has to write it
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.400]   and we'll pull the cameras out.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.320]   We will do it for Mac--
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:01.560]   And we'll shoot it.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:01.560]   --from Mac--
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.400]   --from the shooting commercial.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.840]   Yes, for iPhone.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.520]   Mr. I Life Zone, anything that you're expecting in the new--
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.120]   I presume they're going to do new I life
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.360]   and the new I Life at all.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.560]   Yeah, we're going to probably see the entire I Life Suite
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.200]   upgrade that we tend to see every year.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.920]   Now, that's the one thing Apple's kind of let us count on.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.840]   There's going to be stuff.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.240]   I do believe the biggest upgrades will actually
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.400]   be in the I-Work type area.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:24.880]   We'll see keynote--
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.200]   With the spreadsheet.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.240]   --pages in the spreadsheet.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.560]   We might see a few enhancements to GarageBand
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.720]   on the podcasting side.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.880]   I haven't got reason to believe it'll be anything really
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.400]   dramatic.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.560]   But we'll see incremental upgrades like we've been seeing.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.240]   And it'll, once again, be the very best software value in--
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.080]   The world.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.400]   --in the world.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:46.920]   The world.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.600]   $79 gives you everything you ever wanted.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.160]   All you want.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.000]   All right, Merlin suggested, and we all
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.320]   agreed a couple of things for this year,
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.440]   ander before we do our software picks, which we always do.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.800]   And item one would be one change that we'd all
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.080]   like to make this year.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.640]   Start at Merlin Man.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.280]   Oh, this is my resolution.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.640]   Well, in this issue, I'm going to resolve to interrupt you guys
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.640]   less and to not talk about equine intercourse.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.080]   But I'm also going to--
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.400]   I am going to--
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.520]   I'm falling in the lead of a lot of people on blogs that I read,
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.800]   and take some of my own advice.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.640]   And I'm going to trim way back on the number of inputs.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   That's funny.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.000]   That was exactly what I was going to resolve, too.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.400]   I think this is even in the first one.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.520]   We're all overwhelmed, aren't we?
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.440]   Well, it's funny.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.520]   If I could put on my 43 folders hat for a minute.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.320]   I mean, I think we spend so much time
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.760]   trying to come up with these solutions for how
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.520]   to deal with the back end of these problems,
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.040]   dealing with things like way too much email,
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.040]   or dealing with the consequences, the stress of all of that.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.800]   And you can sit around, and you can put new buckets
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.120]   under your roof all day, or you can go and patch the hole.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.040]   And increasingly, I really feel like I'm getting less and less
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.880]   joy from the huge amount of crap that I shovel into my life.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.320]   And I guess I just want to get a lot
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.080]   of pickier about that kind of stuff.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.600]   And try and spend less time, kind of half-assing,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.160]   through five modes at one time.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.520]   And just stay focused on doing one good thing at a time.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.760]   And I guess removing some of the distractions
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.200]   and attractive nuisances that contribute to that.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.960]   So fewer buckets in a smaller hole.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.040]   That's your resolution.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.320]   Oh, man.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.440]   You know, I think it was your friend,
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:29.640]   Rael Doranfest, who told me that about Larry Lessig declaring
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.160]   email bankruptcy.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.080]   That's absolutely right.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.120]   I love that idea.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.440]   He came back one day.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.680]   He went and he checked and he realized--
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.200]   it's like that day when you inevitably
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.360]   realized that you're spending this five times you're earning.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.320]   And you say, something's got to change.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.720]   And he just said, you know, he wrote a huge BCC to everybody
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.760]   that he heard an email to.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.040]   And he said, just go ahead and write me again.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.440]   I'm throwing out all of my email.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.080]   I think I might do that on a weekly basis.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:56.480]   That's my--
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.560]   You had a really good--
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.840]   I'm starting to love just a little rat hole here.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.480]   But I'm starting to really enjoy the fine art of vacation
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.200]   messages.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.960]   And you had a really good vacation message.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.760]   Did you like that one?
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.840]   I don't like that.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.760]   But it was kind of inspired by Larry Lessig.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.480]   Oh, it's so effective.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.760]   Your vacation message was like, well, you know,
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.960]   I'm not going to be around.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.800]   You can email me, but I probably won't see it.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:19.400]   Why don't you just emailing me again after the first of the year?
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.840]   And you know how did it turn out?
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:21.640]   So far, so good.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.240]   Very few people have emailed me again.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.080]   You're an effective person.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.040]   I'm really counting on that.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.280]   I think email is turning out to be a bad idea, to be honest.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.560]   So is that your resolution?
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.080]   Is yours similar to that?
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.080]   My general resolution is to work less.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.320]   But I think a lot of that is--
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.360]   there's stuff I love to do, like this isn't work for me.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.600]   But there's a lot of busy work that I want to do less of.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.160]   And I think email is certainly one of them.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.160]   Email may be two or three hours of my day
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.640]   that I cannot ever get back.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.800]   And I'm really ready to spend less time on that.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.200]   I don't know how, though.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:56.800]   I really don't.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.880]   I mean, you know, I don't publish my email address much
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.240]   anymore.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.200]   And I get a lot of hateful email saying,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.640]   do you know how hard it was to find this address?
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.040]   Like, I didn't do that to you.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.680]   Obviously, not hard enough.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.480]   Too badly that you don't know a productivity expert
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.200]   or someone like that who could help you.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.720]   Oh, I've talked to Merlin on and on about this.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.520]   He's got this kind of puritanical Calvinistic attitude
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.640]   that you actually have to respond to email in some way.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.320]   That's the hard part.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.560]   I mean, a lot of this is the stuff we talk about on the site
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.320]   has to do with kind of developing
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.560]   these more mature habits and practices
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.880]   and behaviors and attitudes.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.480]   But more immature.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.200]   Well, that doesn't stop the fact that, you know,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.560]   if you feel like you need to respond to every single person
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.760]   that writes to you, I mean, that doesn't scale, you know?
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.120]   Does it?
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.880]   But you guys see that LA Times column today from the guy who
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.400]   is just like quit writing me.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.440]   Everybody, I don't care.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.320]   I don't want your opinion.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.040]   Don't email me.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:50.680]   I don't care.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.280]   Stop saying you were there.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.560]   I think we're going to see more and more of that.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.320]   We're going to be in the backlash because we're just so overwhelmed.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.680]   Well, you know, I don't even put my email address on my business
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.000]   card and everybody gets mad at me.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   I'm like, dude, the phone worked for me for 45--
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.400]   I don't want a phone card either, though.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.440]   I'm like, that's even worse.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:05.920]   Well, I don't even--
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.040]   I don't even take people's business card neither.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:08.400]   People don't--
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.320]   I don't even want to know.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.360]   --he nearly as much as they email me, Leo.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.160]   The bottom line is that everybody has a different idea
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.200]   about what an email means.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.880]   And there are a lot of people for whom, you know,
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.160]   you have to respect the fact that they took the time to write
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:19.520]   you.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.880]   And there are people who really consider an email,
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.800]   like the version of like a virtual hug or a way
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.120]   to reach out to somebody.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.080]   And you don't want to step on people who are doing that.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.720]   But at the same time, you know, you reach a certain point
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.400]   where your inbound email is five times what you can handle.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.200]   And you kind of start making some really hard decisions
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.040]   on how you're going to deal with it.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.000]   And those of us in the public, I have a kind of a unique issue.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.280]   I mean, I think most people don't have the kind of volume
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.960]   of email that we do.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.120]   Talk to Ms. Amber MacArthur about that.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.960]   She's got to both lose a crisp amount of email.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.560]   And Amber and I talk about this a lot
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.520]   because we're both kind of in that boat where we just get
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.120]   a ton of email.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.200]   I once joked to Amber, we're famous enough
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.240]   to get a ton of email, but not rich enough
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.760]   to hire somebody to handle it.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.040]   We're kind of it's kind of the worst of both worlds.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.600]   I find that I, you know, I make it pretty clear to people
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.520]   when I'm talking to them about how to email me.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.040]   And if they don't follow those instructions,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.000]   I don't I just don't see the email.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.760]   You know, and people who there's it's very hard to randomly
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.960]   email me and actually have me have it get through my filters.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.680]   And I have to admit that it's if I don't if I haven't talked
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.600]   to somebody about about something,
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.760]   if they go through the company, they can actually get to me.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.760]   But if they go straight at me and my filters are pretty
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.600]   dense.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.280]   Do you want to share your your outbound voicemail message
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.080]   with people Alex?
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.920]   Well, that's the funny part of the--
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.520]   Oh, it's it's he's got an award winning.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.120]   I like it.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:41.640]   I like it.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.120]   I like it.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.640]   I like it.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.160]   I like it.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.160]   I like what's it like.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.160]   Let's let's hear it on the end.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.000]   It's not as bad as it used to be.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.040]   Hi, this is Alex Lindsey.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.960]   Thanks for calling.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.360]   If you've gotten this message, please don't leave one.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.480]   The best way to get a hold of me is Alex@dbgarage.com.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.880]   If you don't have email, get it.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.440]   But see the key word there was I'll try.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.360]   I'll try.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.120]   And then we all know that I'll try a euphemism for this.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:02.880]   I know when in hell.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.240]   I never will get back to you.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.600]   Don't even bother.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.440]   I left a nice way of saying that.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.160]   I recorded a message for my wife.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.880]   Hi, this is Jennifer's cell phone.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.880]   Don't bother to leave a message.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.360]   She has no idea how to retrieve them.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.800]   And the truth of the matter is, is it takes me about a half
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.160]   an hour to remember how to retrieve my email--
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.280]   how to retrieve my voice mail every time I do it.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:24.080]   And it's only because somebody called that I actually
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.840]   needed to hear from it.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.600]   I'm afraid they might have left a message.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.640]   And that happens about once every six months.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.200]   OK, your resolution, Alex Lindsey.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:39.400]   My resolution is mostly around discipline and organization.
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.080]   So I mean, they're kind of connected to each other.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.760]   But one of the things that I am resolving to do
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.240]   is not save anything to my desktop.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:51.640]   So I have a tendency to leave while I'm working on something,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.600]   things will build up.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   I used to think of it.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.240]   It's my desktop.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.280]   That's where I put them.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.920]   And there was a time many, many moons ago,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.200]   when I was really in production, that literally there
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   was a place for everything.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:03.760]   There was a fold.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.640]   I know I'm starting to sound like Merlin.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.920]   But there was a folder for everything.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.840]   There was a place that everything went.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.360]   And so-- and I missed those days because I used to be able
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.400]   to find things lightning fast.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.480]   And everything had a place.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:21.160]   And so I am committed that by the end of this week,
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:21.640]   I'll have it.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.000]   I've been working on it for a little bit.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.040]   I was in production last week.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.360]   But by the end of this week, everything
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.840]   will have a folder of where it's going.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.600]   And things will be put there for the rest of the year.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.760]   And then-- and that's for me, that's the big thing.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.360]   And then also, just I noticed that I
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:40.760]   burn an enormous amount of time fiddling on the internet.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:45.480]   So I am committing myself to three to four hours of workday
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.240]   during the workday where I'm not connected to the internet.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.680]   So I can actually think.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.680]   So--
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.240]   because I have a horrible habit of,
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.640]   you know, I'll be sitting there working on something.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.680]   And then something pops into my head
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.880]   and I decide to go find out about it.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.760]   As many of you know, I have a slight problem with ADD.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:03.320]   And so I'm committed to not having that happen.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:03.760]   Good.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.480]   How about you, Scott Bourne, resolution?
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.000]   Well, I wish mine were as heady and deep as you guys
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.440]   because I'm starting to feel bad.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.480]   But mine's pretty simple.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.320]   I resolved not to buy a new laptop in 2007.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.480]   Wow.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.000]   Because I've purchased six in the last four years.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.960]   Oh, you don't need to buy--
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.400]   I have this nasty habit of buying every new one that comes along.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.000]   Oh, but you haven't seen this new lightweight one
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.520]   that Apple's going to put out the three pound--
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.040]   Quit it.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.080]   Don't tempt me.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.200]   Anyway, I bought the MacBook Pro, the Core 2 Duo,
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   with three gigs of RAM, 17-inch.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.320]   I'm done for 2007.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.760]   So I resolve, no matter how badly I want to,
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.720]   not to buy a new laptop.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:41.200]   I'm so impressed.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.400]   Like I did last year.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.800]   You're actually not going to buy a laptop for a whole year.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.920]   I bought the MacBook Pro 15-inch at Macworld last year,
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.360]   and then the 17-inch when it came out.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.440]   So that was two in one year this year.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.240]   I'm not buying any in 2007.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.200]   I'm unbelievable.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.000]   This is a man of iron will, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.080]   As Merlin would say, that is a first world problem.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.440]   You're really not going to like my predictions, Scott.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.840]   OK, well, let's start with them predictions, Merlin.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.080]   Man.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.760]   You know, you guys all got all these hairbrane ideas about Step
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.260]   2.
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.240]   Once Scott's got his frickin' iPhone that he's obsessed about.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.480]   I have decided that my completely illogical thing that I am
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:26.320]   going to predict until it happens is an extremely tiny,
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.720]   I want a 12-inch MacBook Pro with a long battery life.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.480]   And that's what I want.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.640]   Oh, man.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.000]   That would-- you know, the 15-inch, I love it.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:35.760]   It's great.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.480]   It does everything.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.480]   But my wife--
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.000]   I love you.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.400]   My wife has a 12-inch G4, and I envy her computer so much.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.040]   I miss my 12-inch.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.120]   So that's going to become my--
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.920]   I guess my millstone is the demand
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:51.960]   that Apple defeat the laws of thermodynamics
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.640]   and engineering to create this impossible 12-inch machine.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.680]   You know what's not that impossible?
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.400]   I have a Dell 12-inch laptop.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.600]   It's got an extended battery.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.920]   I get about four or five hours, solid, real hours out
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.800]   of it running Vista.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.120]   But you have second degree burns on your legs.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.200]   It's not-- no, it's nice.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.360]   It's core, too.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.480]   I put two gigs of RAM in it.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.840]   I put a 7,200 RPM drive in it.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.880]   So you don't think this is crazy?
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.920]   It's far from crazy.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.680]   I think it's with existing technology.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.920]   It's more than doable.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.880]   I think it would sell like hell.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.400]   I love it.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.880]   I mean, that's-- I ended-- you know, my 12-inch
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.000]   is actually a Windows machine.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.080]   But I do miss my old 12-inch Mac.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:27.840]   That's fine.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.240]   Alex Lindsey, prediction.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.280]   And by the way, Merlin said verifiable.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.840]   I guess that means by the end of the year,
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.080]   if it didn't happen, we'll know.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:40.200]   By the end of the year, I predict that a greater than--
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:40.560]   let's see.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.920]   Let me see.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:43.080]   Verifiable.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:43.520]   I don't know how--
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:46.240]   I mean, it's like you can't say that certain barded parts
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.200]   are going to have more or less hair, things like that.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.400]   Things we-- it says to be something
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:50.800]   that we can read in the news.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.600]   Well, I'll say something mundane.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.720]   But I think that it will turn out to be something that's
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.160]   a big deal, maybe by the end of 2007, probably by the end
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.840]   of 2008, is Apple will start to distribute HD content
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:02.520]   over iTunes.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.440]   Yes.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.160]   And over time, that will destroy Bluetooth.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.320]   I mean, not Bluetooth, but--
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:07.960]   Oh, Ray.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.160]   --but HDTV.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.360]   HD DVD.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.560]   Microsoft's already doing it on the Xbox 360.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.680]   They're not for sale or for rent.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:17.160]   But you can download HD quality movies right now.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.200]   And I think we're going to see that on iTunes,
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.280]   definitely before the end of the year,
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.000]   and possibly before the end of January.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:22.880]   I see no reason not to.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.960]   If Microsoft could do it, surely Apple can.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.480]   Yep.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.040]   Good prediction.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.960]   How about you, Scott Borne?
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:27.640]   What do you predict?
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.960]   Verifiable.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   Mine is really simple.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.080]   I predict Apple stock climbs above 100 and then splits.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.920]   I think you might be right on that one.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.920]   I already made my prediction.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:44.320]   I think Leopard's going to be announced in one week from today.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.320]   Will it be cool?
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.400]   It will be cool.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:50.240]   It will be-- they've got to have one thing--
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.720]   you kind of intimated this-- that Steve's got to say one
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.440]   thing that people will line up at the Apple Store
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.640]   for right after the keynote.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.680]   And not hardware this year, I predict it's going to be Leopard.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:01.280]   All right.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.280]   We do still want to do, I think, our software picks.
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.200]   Unless this superseded that.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:06.760]   What do you think?
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.360]   Should we?
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.520]   No, we should do our picks.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.400]   You got to ask, Scott Borne?
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.880]   Yeah, but as I recall, they're not limited to software.
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.960]   Hardware is fun.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.560]   Hardware is fun.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.800]   I'm going to talk about something that's not Mac specific,
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.520]   but Mac users will want one after they try it.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:22.960]   What's that?
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.720]   And I fell in love with this little puppy.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.720]   I got me one of the Logitech MX Revolution cordless mice.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.160]   Ooh.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.880]   And I mean, this thing, if there was a Porsche that
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:37.560]   could be turned into a computer mouse, this would be it.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.080]   This thing has got so many-- it's got 2.9
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.440]   cub billion buttons and wheels on it.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.280]   I have to say, this is the one thing Apple has still not done
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.320]   right.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.280]   And my advice to anybody buying a Mac, the first thing I say
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.480]   is go out and get a Windows mouse.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.400]   If this is a cordless mouse that has a built-in recharger
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.640]   that it sits in, very convenient, it
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.760]   has all kinds of programmable buttons.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.520]   And most importantly for me, because I've
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:05.760]   been dealing with some issues related to Carpal Tungal,
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:09.640]   it's ergonomically far superior to anything else out there.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:13.320]   Does all the Duwiki's work on Mac?
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:13.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.480]   It's programmable.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.840]   It's Logitech, Scott?
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.040]   Yeah, Logitech MX Revolution.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:23.160]   I've got a Logitech, the keyboard and mouse set that I like.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.040]   It's all cordless, but mine doesn't do any cords.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.360]   Does yours do-- can you do click both buttons
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.760]   to select and drag and stuff like that?
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.000]   Oh, this C-H-O-R-D cord.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.840]   This thing has something like seven
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.200]   programmable buttons on it.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.080]   It has a scroll wheel that's a real wheel.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.280]   And you can spin it.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.800]   It's slicker than snuck.
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.640]   You can just spin it and scroll through very long things.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.760]   It has a button-- I've programmed the top button
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.880]   to be my dashboard button.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.400]   And then it has a sideways scroll, a forward scroll.
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.840]   Check it out on the website at Logitech.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.040]   And is it equally lefty or righty?
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.040]   Because that's important for me.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.600]   I'm a lefty.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.400]   Well, now--
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:03.920]   Is it symmetric?
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.880]   I can't verify Leo because I'm a righty.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.760]   So you can't tell if it's symmetric or not.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.120]   I don't know.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.960]   You could look at it and you could say it's symmetric.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:14.880]   You could just--
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.880]   Will you hold it in your left hand as it hurt?
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.720]   It does not appear to be that this particular model would
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.640]   be one that I would use if I were left handed.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.160]   However, they may have a left handed version.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.840]   It's got an extension thing where your right thumb goes,
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:27.520]   unfortunately.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.960]   So you're kind of forced to use it that way.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.640]   Damn you!
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.200]   Damn you, Scott Pawn!
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.240]   Again, you know what--
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.760]   What did my appetite--
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.000]   I don't own any shares in Logitech
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.760]   or else I would tell them to fix that for you, Leo.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.600]   Well, the MX-1000 is actually agnostic.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.040]   So there you go.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.560]   Maybe I'll just get this.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.640]   But the revolution is the best.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.080]   No, I like the revolution.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.480]   We actually had it on call for help,
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.120]   and it's very impressive.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.560]   But once again, lefties are left.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.240]   I don't understand.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.440]   There's so many lefties in computing why they would do that.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:55.840]   Just to make it.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.200]   Well, hey, welcome to my world, Bubby.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.680]   You ought to try being a fat guy.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.040]   Oh, I have.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.040]   We left out of everything.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:01.880]   Oh, I have.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.480]   Let me tell you.
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.720]   I would love to see a mouse for a fat guy.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.480]   The fat guy's president of the horizontal.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.200]   We challenge Mac users of America.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.440]   I'm tired of it.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.120]   I've got a fat guy with a mouse.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.080]   It comes with a mouse.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:17.040]   Our ladies and gentlemen, software pick or hardware pick
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.160]   from Alex Lindsay.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.240]   So I started playing with something new.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.240]   And so it's still in testing.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.440]   But it is called Tubular.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.680]   Have you guys seen Tubular?
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.040]   What is that?
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.680]   It's totally tubular.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.960]   It's like, dude man, it is like so tubular.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.320]   It's so it's totally tubular.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:47.160]   It is a tubular you basically have an interface for YouTube.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.320]   It's kind of like having iTunes and YouTube mesh together.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.880]   So it's totally like a OSX kind of thing.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.480]   And what it lets you do is you can sit there and search
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.480]   for whatever you want out of YouTube.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.040]   And it's live.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.840]   I mean, you can look at what the most current things are
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:03.640]   or whatever.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.600]   But it searches YouTube.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.760]   And then it shows you the videos.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.640]   And then you can click on them and watch them and everything
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.300]   else.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.080]   You can also-- it's got a little button at the top that
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.840]   just says convert to iPod.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.440]   And it'll just make the conversion for you.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.000]   You can look at most recent, most of you,
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.960]   most discussed, all those things within the search
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.160]   that you're doing.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.080]   And so it gives you kind of that without actually having
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.520]   to go to the web.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.640]   We all know how much I hate the web.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.920]   So it's great to have a--
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:36.200]   weren't you the one that resolved not to use the web so much?
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:36.880]   Yes.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.400]   Yes.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.320]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.320]   So you found this in the web?
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.080]   Distraction, of course.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.080]   This is the internet, but not the web.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.080]   Oh, I get it.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.240]   Oh, that's different.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.080]   No, no, no.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:49.120]   So what I like about it, of course,
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.600]   is that I generally think that about 90% of what
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:56.560]   we see on the web would be better if it was an app,
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.480]   an ed app, like iTunes.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.520]   And I think this is a perfect example of that.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.560]   And it's a great little interface to kind of go through.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.840]   I wish it would show me the actual views, the number of
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:06.040]   views.
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.600]   It doesn't show me that.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.360]   But anyway, so it's a pretty nifty little app.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.760]   And it's in beta.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:14.760]   You can go up there to their website.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.280]   And I think it's just tubular.com.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.040]   And you can request a beta.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.200]   And they'll hopefully send you one.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:21.840]   Very cool.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:23.840]   They sent one to me really quickly.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.280]   Because they know--
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:25.120]   What I said I knew Leo.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.280]   Make it on Mac Break.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.960]   Weekly, you're pick.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   That's something to do with it.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.920]   I'm going to throw mine in and I'll let Merlin wrap this up
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.160]   because he always has the best little software applications.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.320]   I asked you before we began, if we'd done image well before,
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.360]   I'm kind of surprised we have it.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.480]   Because it's been around for a while.
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.880]   It's kind of a little app that's very useful.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.640]   It's free.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:46.760]   You can pay, I think, $14 or $15 extra if you want to add
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.800]   some extra features to it.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:52.080]   What it is is a little drag and drop well, an image well,
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:56.720]   that you can drag images on, resize them, do some simple
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.600]   editing.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.840]   And then it has built in FTP.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.440]   So you can--
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:00.880]   Wow.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.080]   You press the send button and it's up on your server.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.560]   So it's really handy for bloggers, people who have websites
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.920]   and just want to get an image up there.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920]   It has drop shadows.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.960]   It has water marking.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.640]   It has cropping, rotation, special frames, all sorts of nice
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.840]   little features.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.440]   Image well is the program.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.560]   This is cool, Leo.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.080]   Oh, you found it already?
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.240]   Extralean.com.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:24.840]   Extralean.com.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.040]   That's what I was just going to say.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:26.960]   I can't remember where it's from.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.280]   Extralean.com.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.320]   They make extra lean software.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.080]   Actually, they have one other program called Shutterbug,
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:32.880]   which I haven't tried.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.600]   And I'm not sure if it's something I could use or not.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.640]   But I could tell you, you should have image well.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.800]   If you ain't got it, get it.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.160]   $14.95 for the extras.
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:43.920]   That's how much it is.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.280]   And it's at extraleanxtralene.com.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.240]   That looks cool.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:50.400]   You like it?
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.160]   I like it.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.960]   It's very nice with the making of the--
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.280]   Faking with the high, the high.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.960]   The uploading, dragging, and dropping.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.520]   Merlin Mann, what do you suggest?
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.640]   Ritalin for all my friends.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   I agree.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.640]   I am.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.480]   I am.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.640]   I posted this one this morning on 43folders.com.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.320]   But I think this is a really neat application.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.920]   It's called Task List.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.800]   And it is a little application that I
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.520]   would have killed for when I was in college.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.240]   It is a very--
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.400]   it's kind of a typical three-pane task tracking
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   application directed at students.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.600]   Makes it very easy for you to enter in all the classes
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.480]   that you have.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.800]   And then put in any kind of homework, assignments, papers,
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.960]   anything that's going to be coming down the pike.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.760]   When it's due, what's your progress on it is,
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.600]   you can do document attachments.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.920]   You can create notes.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.240]   You can subscribe to these things called Class Casts, which
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.600]   I guess are podcasts from your class.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.200]   I went to school in the early 19th century,
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.520]   so we didn't have those then.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.360]   But it's a really nice--
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.000]   it's a young application, so it's still kind of working
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.720]   some of the bugs out.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.680]   But it worked great for me.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.120]   And if you're the kind of person who
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.160]   benefits from a little bit of fiddly metal work,
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.680]   this could be the way to get all your stuff wrangled.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.280]   It's free, and I believe open source.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.680]   It's free, is in beer.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.520]   And the place where you can get it is mac.com address
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:20.880]   idisc.mac.com/gonfunko, G-O-N-F-U-N-K-O.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.200]   Now that reminds me--
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.680]   because I was trying to help my daughter who's in high school
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.680]   with this kind of stuff with note-taking and so forth.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.080]   And I did some research, and I found out
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.120]   there is a--
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.120]   you must have heard of this.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.500]   You seem like the kind of guy who wouldn't
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.760]   Merlin, the Cornell method for note-taking.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.560]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.720]   I had a list about that a couple years ago.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.960]   And it's a way of--
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.280]   Go ahead.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.400]   I'm not just going to say it's a way of--
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.760]   this is a topic that comes up a lot,
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.400]   is just having a quick way, just slightly more organized way
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.480]   than just a blank sheet of paper in order to take notes.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.280]   And this is a way of dividing your little piece of paper
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.000]   up into four sections.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.320]   And you have kind of a large, wide well
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.760]   for taking all of your notes.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.280]   Then you've got a study section column
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.480]   where you can make notes in the side.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.480]   And then you've got kind of a meta section at the top.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.400]   And at the bottom, you can do a synopsis of everything
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.200]   that's on that page.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200]   Makes it very quick.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.120]   And it's easy for you to find the information
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.280]   that you're looking for in your notes.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:15.960]   You know what it does?
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.680]   You know why I love this?
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.880]   And I love stuff like this.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.200]   Anybody can take notes.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.640]   It's a quote Jerry Seinfeld.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.000]   You're good at taking the reservations,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.040]   but you're not good at holding the reservation.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.200]   Anybody can take notes, right?
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.440]   Take you, take you, take you, take you, take you.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.280]   But then if you don't do anything with them,
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.120]   in turn, anything that's useful for actually studying,
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.000]   you're screwed.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.400]   And so the beauty of this is, it really
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.320]   encourages interaction after the notes are taken.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.000]   And with just a little bit of care and meta work,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.360]   you have something really useful that
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.840]   can benefit you for the rest of the class.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.360]   There's a--
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.160]   You should have done some of those notes.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.240]   Exactly.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.400]   You can look at them again.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.960]   I never looked at them again.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.400]   We have an article on the wiki.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.440]   If you go to wiki.43folders.com, we've
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.000]   got some good links on the Cornell notes
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:55.760]   that you can check out.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.000]   There are numbers by my junior year in high school.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.680]   I realized that I didn't really read the notes,
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.000]   so I just stopped taking them.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   I just started doodling.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:03.840]   There's a--
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.280]   Yeah, pages and pages of Sabbath rules.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.360]   That's basically my notes.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.480]   What the hell school did you go to?
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.120]   Aussie.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.480]   Oh, I thought you meant rules for keeping the Sabbath.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.160]   I know.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.360]   OK.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.200]   He's just crazy.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.840]   He's dogging about black Sabbath man.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.320]   Black.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.000]   That's how it goes.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.640]   Actually, I was going to mention 11 elevian21.com
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:36.520]   It has a PDF generator to make your own Cornell method paper
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.160]   with graph over some.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.560]   So these are kind of new ones.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.640]   Because I printed out a bunch for Abby.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.520]   I know, because it's so hard to make it to yourself.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.360]   Yeah, I know.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.600]   Hey, if you can do it on the computer, it's always better.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.800]   So I think those are our picks.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.960]   Those are our resolutions.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:54.320]   Those are our predictions for the coming year.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.520]   And of course, I have one prediction.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.360]   We're going to have great coverage all next week.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:04:59.960]   It's going to be crazy.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.440]   Macworld.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.320]   Tell us what we're planning here, Alex Lindsay.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.960]   Because I think only you know.
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.760]   Well, there is, of course, on Monday,
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.960]   we're going to be covering a little bit of the pre-show stuff.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.800]   On Tuesday, we're going to be wandering around the show.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.480]   So we'll have a mixture of Mac break and Mac break weekly.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.840]   But we'll be shooting video for Mac break on the floor,
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:22.640]   covering whatever Apple talks about, whatever they announce.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.480]   Tuesday at 6, we are going to be at the Apple Store.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.320]   And we're doing a live Mac break weekly.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.640]   In Dolby and phone, by the way.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:31.880]   Yes.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.960]   And is that-- that's live?
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.520]   Is that right?
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.040]   No.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.560]   Well, when you're recording it that way--
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.480]   Yeah, we're recording that way.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.920]   When you listen to the podcast, listen with headphones.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.000]   You don't need anything special.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.360]   It'll work on your iPod.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.280]   And Alex Lindsay will actually be floating slightly up
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.320]   and to the left of all the rest of us.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.400]   It'll be wonderful.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.560]   It's going to be a disembodied voice from over your head.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.560]   So then the--
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.480]   So then the--
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.520]   Right after the show at the Apple Store,
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.840]   we're all going to traipse over to the 21st Amendment.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.720]   And we're going to have some beer.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.280]   So it was where the upper section--
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:04.840]   We have a little--
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.200]   Upper section is all ours.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.040]   There's a table with a plaque on it saying--
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:08.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560]   It'll be--
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:13.560]   In 2004, Twit began at this table.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.840]   So we're going right back to where it started.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.880]   Kevin Rose passed out here.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.400]   Actually, you can see that almost everywhere.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.400]   They'd run out of where it is.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.800]   There's a lot of all over the place.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.520]   It's like Jordan Washington.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.440]   It is just everywhere, everywhere.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.400]   So the--
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.320]   It'll all be on Twit.tv if you want to follow virtually.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.920]   But we'd love to see you on Tuesday, the 9th at Apple Store,
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.520]   6 p.m.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.120]   And then the 21st Amendment brewery, if you're over 21.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.000]   I'm going to be one of Alex's worker
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.760]   bees out there on the floor.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.800]   If we do this the way we're planning--
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.760]   we're still talking about this.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.640]   But we're going to go out and look at all the exciting Mac OS
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.600]   10 productivity apps on the floor.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.440]   So if you have an exciting Mac, if I could just
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.640]   put in a plug for this for Mac break,
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.000]   if you have an app like that that you would like for us
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.800]   to look at, stop by 43 folders, leave a comment
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.600]   or send me an email, and let us know.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.080]   And we'll try to make a point to stop by and visit with you.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.000]   I'm meeting with VMware to take a look at their new Mac
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.040]   version on Tuesday as well.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.920]   That should be interesting.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.760]   And we'll also--
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.320]   Kendra will be wandering around looking at gadgets.
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:15.800]   OK.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.760]   Emory's coming in to look at some of the more of the pro stuff.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.560]   So we're going to have a lot of people floating around.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.040]   I'll be there, of course, too.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.080]   And Leo, if we're going to crash all this stuff out
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.400]   and get it up online as quickly as we can.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.680]   By the end of the week, we should have a pretty good list
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.560]   for people to know what's going on on Twitch.tv.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.800]   And if this week, we'll let you know what's going on.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.440]   And if this week--
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.640]   At the end of next week, we'll tell you exactly what happened.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.000]   So all our predictions.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.280]   We should be getting those videos up day of with it.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:42.680]   Day of.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.720]   No, no, we have a whole crew getting ready to be--
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.640]   literally be recording, editing, throwing them up
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.600]   the same day.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.520]   And a lot of stuff will be going up every day.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.880]   So definitely tune in.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.400]   Can't wait.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.640]   Thursday at noon, Leo, we're going
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:59.400]   to do an episode of the iLiveZone at the Macworld Magazine booth.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.240]   Chris, bring Derek's story in myself.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.760]   Everybody can stop by and say hi.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.960]   I think I'm there at 3.15 on Tuesday.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.480]   So it's going to be a party.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.200]   And are you doing your usual sessions as well,
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.160]   Scott, at Macworld or not?
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.960]   Derek and I have the Power Tools Conference or whatever they call it.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.480]   We're teaching Aputure for two straight days.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:21.480]   I'll be in the lynda.com booth doing Aputure and GarageBand
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.480]   demos.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.360]   And then we'll be Thursday night also at the Apple Store.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.840]   Don't forget with the Mac casters meetup.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.160]   I'll be at that as well.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:31.640]   That's--
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.400]   At 6 PM.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.520]   And then there's a party at Gillian's for any badged
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.920]   Macworld attendee.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.840]   Ah, well, I'm badged.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.440]   One person who won't be at Macworld Expo
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.480]   and will be Ms. Bruce Frazier, of course,
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.640]   who passed away of lung cancer this past week
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.480]   and was one of the great guys in Mac publishing,
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.840]   Mac writer, and he will be missed.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.760]   I'm sure that there'll be a few people
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.480]   raising a cup or two to Bruce.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.760]   So creativepro.com, if you want to know more about Bruce
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.520]   and his life and work.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.080]   And one more thing about if people
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.160]   are looking for what's going on at Macworld,
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.440]   there's a website that has been building up
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:18.080]   as the kind of the place to go, which is www.ilenezmachine.com.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:18.800]   Yes, that's--
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.440]   Last party list.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.200]   That's the Hess-- is that the Hess list?
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:21.960]   Yeah, the Hess list.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.440]   Hess party list in honor of yet another great Mac guy who
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.520]   is no longer with us, but who certainly liked the party.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.080]   And his name lives on on the party list, which is kind of neat.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.400]   And just about everything that's going on at the show
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.920]   is there, and we're in there as well.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.640]   So I would love to be memorialized with a party list, guys.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.440]   When I go, would you do that for me?
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.360]   Yeah, it'll be a little bit of--
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.600]   It's a plaque, too.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.240]   A little plaque.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.040]   Put it on 21st century, a table somewhere.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.040]   Guys, what is the closeout now?
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.160]   So long suckers.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.520]   Another Mac is broke.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.440]   His break is broke.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.360]   Break time is over.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.520]   Break time is over.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.020]   Folks.
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:58.200]   How about break time is over, suckers?
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.080]   We're getting excited.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:09:59.880]   I think you are, too.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.560]   Macworld Expo just around the corner,
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.600]   and we'll be here to cover it.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.240]   We'll see you later on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.640]   Hey, this is Merlin.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.360]   Are you ready for me now, Mr. Mann?
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.440]   Yes, boys.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.520]   I always read a few videos.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.960]   OK, Mr. Mann.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:20.880]   Did you see the links?
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.480]   I sent you on delicious.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.600]   You'll see I sent you extensive information
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:29.840]   about the Niagara Falls/Slalie-I-Turn/Slalie-I-Turn.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.080]   Niagara Falls!
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.800]   Slowly I turned and step by step.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.440]   Inch by inch, I walked up to him and I smashed him.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.440]   Oh, I moved him.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.440]   I moved him.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.440]   I moved him.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   I made him.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.680]   And I knocked him down.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.440]   I don't understand my women don't like that.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.120]   I can't.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.960]   I'll never understand that.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:54.680]   Do women really not like the Three Stooges or is that just?
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:55.640]   Insleece.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:59.160]   I mean, my wife-- my wife watches family guy with me.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.360]   She watches-- she requests that'll start galactic.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.560]   But she won't watch the Three Stooges.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.720]   No conditions.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.440]   Ever.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.440]   Huh.
