[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.760]   We are about to lay down two hours of the best Mac commentary you have ever heard.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   Because, here he is, Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times wearing his...
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.760]   Leo, I thought that we were saving that as a big surprise for the end.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.760]   But yes, we are going to a full-scumorphic presentation here.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.760]   So if you could light up the CGI revolving reels that are going to be behind us here on the green screen.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.760]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.760]   You know, I'm old enough that I edited tape with a razor blade, a grease pencil,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.760]   a little scotch tape to tape it together.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   That's how I got my start in radio.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.760]   In fact, when I started in radio, we would wrap the cap stand of the tape machine to get it to go faster or slower.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   Because we didn't have any way of making speeding up or growing down.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   It's a long story. You don't really care.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.760]   Also with us from iMore.com, Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   Hello Renee.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   I can't believe the deal Andy got on those used Reel to Reels from the podcast app.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   That's just fantastic.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   Yeah, they took him out.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760]   Andy picked him up.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.760]   Hey, before something more serious, before we get too deep into the conversation,
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   I know Andy that you were close to Roger Ebert.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.760]   You worked with him at the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.760]   And as Roger discovered Twitter and the internet, I think you were probably somewhat of a guide.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.760]   We're very sorry to have lost him.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   What an amazing person.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   And it was really interesting to watch the tributes all over the internet and everywhere to this great man.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.760]   Yeah, I mean, he was really quite wonderful.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   I flew out to Chicago for a couple of days of the memorial services.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   I just got back late last night.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   And really, we're going to turn this into a show about Roger.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   The thing that really struck you the most about those events was the private service was for French and French and family on Sunday.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.760]   And that was maybe 100, 120 people.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   The church service was a wider, a wider boat.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   It was also partly open to the public.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:50.760]   And really, the Chaz, his wife, said the same thing at both events that Roger would have loved each of these events because what he really loved most of all was bringing people together.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:04.760]   And he was an avid collector of experiences of connecting to human beings of where I, as excited as I get when I get to try out the iPhone or I get to try out an iPad or I get to try out a new piece of software.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.760]   I'm so excited and I love this thing so much.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.760]   The first thing I want to do is I want everybody else to know how cool this thing is.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.760]   Roger was exactly the same way with people where he would meet somebody and he'd find that thing that would just put the light, the pilot light in them.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   And the next thing you know, he's introducing this person to you.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.760]   And the way he's talking about what this person does, you're like, "Oh my God, I just thought that I was going to be having lunch.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   I can't believe I'm meeting the most incredible person in the world."
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   And he really did, he had that kind of enthusiasm and he shared that sort of enthusiasm.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   And the fact that he took off on social media like a house of fire was because his mode of life and his perspective on humanity, he was delighted to find that there was now digital infrastructure to facilitate that sort of stuff.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   So we're going to be seeing more of that stuff in the future.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:01.760]   The last thing he posted a couple of days before he passed was about talking about his new initiative, taking RogerEbert.com into a private company.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   He has a new venture called Ebert Digital.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   They're going to be hearing a lot more of a lot of different projects to sort of continue the work that he was doing online.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   But yeah, I mean he was just a fantastic, fantastic person.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   Amazing.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   This is probably the first day that I've been able to talk about him like live to each other people for like more than three minutes, 30 seconds without saying.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   Okay, let's just put something over the camera right now.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   The microphone, I'll be back in about three days when I feel like I want to get out of my bed again.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   But yeah, he was just, I'm sorry that more people didn't get to meet him firsthand.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   That's kind of one of the reasons why I would have loved if you had come to the conference on World Affairs because he was the pope of that week and he enjoyed just reading his blessings to everybody.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   I deeply regret not having met him and I'm very jealous that you got to know him for 20 years and I encourage people to visit your website at nocco.com where you eulogize Roger, a short eulogy the day he passed and then a little bit longer one about the services from yesterday.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   There'll be a couple more pieces.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.760]   If you're in Chicago, there's a final public service of the Chicago theater.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   That's more of a celebration of his life and his work.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   I'm not sure if you need to phone a head for tickets for that, but that's interesting to go to.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   I have a couple more things I want to say and I've decided that as long as I say it before, the end of Thursday, I can still say it afterwards.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   It's, you know, well, and I want to refer people to that because your website's the place to read this and I just wanted to mention it and pass our condolences to you and also my deep jealousy that you got to know him for 20 years.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   You are a lucky man and he and that definitely was.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   Goodness we had his writing and you know, it's funny. They redesigned his website like two days after he died and it's so much nicer.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   Yeah, no, again, this was a very, very big deal. It's not as though he was like, oh, I think I'll, he's like, he got an account on WordPress.org or getting a Tumblr blog.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   This was this is a very, very serious initiative.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   They got a bunch of digital partners and there's a lot of, I heard about a lot of different projects talking to Chaz and the head of the digital initiative about what they're doing there.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   So we're doing some really cool stuff.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   If there's any way we can help publicize it, let us know because I would love to do that.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.760]   I will definitely let you know about that sort of stuff because the more people know about this, the better.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.760]   Yeah, I'm thrilled to hear it. And of course, all of his writing is there, Roger Ebert.com.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:35.760]   So changing to a, on a lighter note, as you all know, last week I spent about $1,500 putting a new video card, a new SSD into my Mac Pro.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   And I figured that that would, that would get the gears going in Cooper Tino.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   Apparently it has. Now, we don't know for sure. This is a rumor.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   But everybody's picked it up. And so first let me ask how, you know, here's the rumor guy, Renee Richie.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.760]   How credible is this? Have you heard the same drum beats that there will be a Mac Pro this month?
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   I have not. I have not.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   I don't traditionally hear too much about Mac Pro because they haven't updated them in like three years.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.760]   So there hasn't been much to hear. If there were a rumor, it would be a big deal.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   Yeah, absolutely. And that's, I don't, I think it was Mac Daily News or Mac Daily News had the story.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.760]   And I don't even know how credible they are to be honest.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   I don't know either because they're not a big source of news. They're sort of not a very big track record to look at.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   There is only really, you know, Tim Cook's assertion that he'll have something for Pro users this year.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   And we should make that clear. I don't think Tim at any point said there would be a new Mac Pro this year.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.760]   No, he said there is something for Mac Pro users.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   Yeah. And I mean, some people are saying WDC would make good sense for that kind of announcement.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.760]   Because that's the developer conference. Yeah.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:50.760]   Maybe or another fall event, but I don't. And also Mac Pros are kind of the thing where Apple, unless they want to show off some radical new redesign or some fantastic new technology.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.760]   They usually dump those in press releases before events anyway. So I'm.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   What they said, what's up, Mac Daily News said, a source who has been correct about the news.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.760]   That's the first red flag who has been correct about Apple product matters in the past just informed us.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:18.760]   Our source offered no information as to whether the Mac Pro replacement would be a tower, mini tower or some other solution, but did caution red flag number two that the announcement could slip into May or even June, but April looks most likely.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   I wouldn't, you know, what can you say? It's not like somebody's, but maybe they are thinking about buying a PC and hack and sashing it.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.760]   I guess if you were thinking about that, you might want to wait a little bit.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.760]   I kept hearing about an April event, but mostly for iPads and now it sounds like the iPads might not be ready either.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:48.760]   That's the big advantage Apple has is that they don't pre-announce. They don't go and give you these road maps so that they can adjust to whether the battery life is not long enough or the supplies aren't where they want them to be or the inventory is not there yet.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.760]   And then they can pick a date and, you know, maybe give Andy seven days notice to get there.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:10:13.760]   Yeah. Well, as, I mean, as a matter of fact, that was one of the reasons why I didn't go to the conference and World Affairs this year because I have, I had been hearing things a few months ago that weren't good enough to make me want to buy a plane ticket for the for a certain week in April, but was solid enough to think, well, Jim also going to be, you know, preparing a talk at this event.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.760]   I'm going to have to do this earlier.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:15.760]   Okay.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.760]   Maybe spending a week in Boulder is not a good idea for that particular month.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:29.760]   But yeah, it's like when he says, I mean, it's every every time I think I've heard a good rumor and I don't, I'm not really in the pipeline for the top tier great rumors is like, this is really, really good.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   He's if you see a photograph of something, if you see an internal document saying we were locking down.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.760]   Oh my God, the entire house is going to crumble down on top of us if we don't make this date.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   And then three days later, someone decides, you know what, we're now we're thinking about June or July for that.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   Okay.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   It's a really, it really does happen all the time.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   The time that way, John Gruber points to a thread on branch, which you're on Renee.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.760]   What is branch?
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:11:01.760]   First of all, a branch is sort of like if Twitter is a giant room full of people branches a little table in the corner where a few of you can get together and discuss specific topics.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.760]   So this is a good table to sit at.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.760]   M.G.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:15.760]   Seagler started at Tim Stevens of Engadget, Clayton Morris, Renee Richie, John Gruber, and a bunch of others all talking about Apple and the iPhone.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.760]   And Gruber says a couple of points of speculation that he had it.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.760]   He heard that iOS seven is running behind.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.760]   And then that's the next version of iOS.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.760]   And the next, the engineers have been pulled from the next version of OS 10 to work on it.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   And he says regarding Johnny Ive and iOS word on the street is that iOS engineers with carry privileges all have some sort of polarizing filter on their iPhone displays such that it greatly decreases viewing angles.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:56.760]   So that people can't see over their shoulders to see what John characterizes as an apparently rather significant system wide UI overhaul.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:04.760]   And I'd have to extrapolate from that given that you mentioned, you mentioned Johnny Ive that this is the flattening of iOS that people have talked about.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   The elegantizing. Yeah, if it matches up with what I heard from somebody in February, it's that it's not going to be adding or my understanding as a February was that it's not as though there's going to be an overhaul of the functionality of iOS seven, but it would be visibly quite different.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:42.760]   So if you're expecting something like, you know, like a Facebook, Facebook, Android style, now we're shifting, we're positioning the up of the operating system away from app tiles and onward to people in event tiles, nothing that nothing like that, according to what I've heard.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:53.760]   But yeah, it's it seems as though they're doing a major house clip house cleaning of the looking for the overall look of the OS, which is definitely necessary because it really is starting to.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:00.760]   This is it's it's almost as if the iPhone iOS is the only operating system that still doesn't anti alias text.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:14.760]   It's that there's such a there's I mean, there's such a trend away from really standardized formalized user interface. It really does look like 2007 with each, every time another manufacturer comes up the new operating system or a new major update.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:22.760]   It the iOS looks older and older and older. So even if it doesn't add features, even if it just makes it look flatter and prettier and simpler and cleaner and more.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   I don't know Norwegian, I suppose. That's at least the step in the right direction.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   Is that what we're calling this flat design or the Norwegian design? It's going to come with like a little two headed out on wrench to put the home screen back.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:48.760]   That's the this. So yeah, he quotes Renee Richie actually is from this branch. I've worked as apparently making many people really happy, but will also apparently make rich texture loving designers.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   Sad.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   That's actually a Louis Manchia reference because Louis loves, you know, rich visual design and he's not apparently going to be happy with and Louis well known so phrasing it that way is kind of code in the Apple community for what kind of interface you're going to get.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:11.760]   And I didn't hear specifically about a delay. I did hear that it was more of an August timetable than a June timetable, which might factor in a delay.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:20.760]   But it's exactly what Andy said, like if you're expecting the phone to turn on and there to be something other than a row of icons and springboard, you're going to be disappointed.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:32.760]   But if you are expecting it to turn on and it to be, you know, Johnny I was down there in the lab. People are really happy and for it to be a more elegant statement of iOS, a less richly texture statement of iOS than you.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:44.760]   I point everybody to this branch thread because there's something about this, whatever this thing is that people are willing to kind of, you know, speculate a little more wildly than you might on your actual blogs and websites.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.760]   So you're getting some, you know, you'll have to take it with a grain of salt, Clayton Morris.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:55.760]   For instance, says there will be an April event in which the I watch the flat panel TV and a new cards app for iOS will be announced.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.760]   He was trolling.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.760]   He was trolling.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.760]   But it's fun to read.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.760]   It's all the same device.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   Highly wrecked.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   I'm signing up.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.760]   I'm signing up.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.760]   I never heard of this branch.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   The stuff that John said I have also now heard from other people.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.760]   So I think that, you know, what the information John presented is really credible.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   Interesting.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   Three M makes a, actually just makes a commercial product exactly like that, a privacy filter that reduces the angle of view to practically nothing.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   We've talked about that for years.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   That's been around at least 10 years and people use it on airplanes and so forth.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   And if it's a 5S or even if they're running it on the 5, you know, the hardware itself wouldn't mean anything to anybody.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.760]   It would only be what they saw on the screen and that clearly reduces that problem.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   What do you think of this branch?
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760]   It's fun.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.760]   I don't, I think MG is connected to it.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.760]   I'm not positive, but I mean, it's a really good tool that lets you have the problem.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:58.760]   One of the problems with Twitter is that it can be chaotic and they're feeling a lot of noise and this lets you basically separate out a conversation that goes from and then goes back into what's related to Twitter in a way.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:06.760]   Well, you know, that's one of the things I've always said Twitter needed threaded conversations and then, you know, that's why I left Twitter for Jiku at 100 years ago.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.760]   Me too.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.760]   And we've been proven wrong time and time again.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   So this will be just another example of the tech pundits not knowing what the hell they're talking about, but I'm going to go there.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   It's really cool.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.760]   Really, really interesting.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760]   There's been some great discussions.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.760]   Especially there's an Apple group.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.760]   So if Apple's your area of interest, it's worthwhile checking out.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.760]   Cool.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   I don't know how I forgot what I was going to segue into from this.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.760]   I'll tell you what, I'll segue into a commercial and then we'll then it'll all come back to me.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:49.760]   We do still have a lot of gossip to talk about and maybe some serious stuff as well.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.760]   Three words.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.760]   Beyonce baby bomb.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.760]   Back after this.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.760]   That's the canonical gossip's title.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   Beyonce's baby bump.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   You know, if we titled the show Beyonce's baby bump, maybe we'd have more downloads.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.760]   Let's think about it.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.760]   CEO, how about Johnny Ives baby bump?
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.760]   No.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   Cat fight.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   Should we change the name of it to Mac break weekly?
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.760]   M A C like Mac makeup.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.760]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   Sure.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   That was a stretch.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   That was a stretch.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   Really quite a stretch.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   Something had to come in there.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.760]   There was a pause.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:35.000]   This show brought to you by it's timely gazelle.com.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   You know, we get a lot of gazelle ads whenever there's going to be new iOS hardware.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.640]   So I'm thinking gazelle knows something.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.760]   Maybe this is a indicator, a leading indicator.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:51.320]   Gazelle is the place people go when they say, I'm ready to get the next iPhone or iPad or
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.320]   cell phone.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.160]   Actually, there's we know there's enough cell phone action in here and maybe make people
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:05.440]   head to gazelle and say, Hey, I've got a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 as I do.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.080]   And I'd like to sell that.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.600]   Let me get an offer right here.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.200]   Click get an offer.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   And what shape is it in?
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.280]   Well, it's not flawless, but it's pretty good shape.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.840]   I mean, you know, free of water damage.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.840]   Well, yeah, dah.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.400]   I put liquid pelle on it.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.800]   So let's calculate and two to 20 bucks.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   That's worth now.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.280]   Here's the best part.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.480]   That quote is good for 30 days.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.680]   So even though we don't know what's going to happen in April, I can guarantee you one
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:37.560]   thing I know will happen that phone or laptop or desktop or screen or iPad is not going
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.680]   to gain in value.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   It's going down.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.240]   It always is.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.360]   That's the way it is with this stuff.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.360]   So get a quote now.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.360]   It's good for 30 days.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.920]   You'll be locked in.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.760]   And then when the new thing comes out, you can get that box from gazelle.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.920]   They pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.920]   Look here.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.280]   I've had two 32 gig Wi-Fi is worth 185 bucks.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.120]   That can't even be.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   How could that be?
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.640]   That's like ancient.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.640]   It's not even LTE and it's not even 64.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640]   Wow.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.680]   So now get the box.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.600]   Their data experts will wipe the data off it.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.080]   You don't have to worry about it.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:14.600]   You know, I've many heard many, many stories from fans and listeners who've said that
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.480]   I got a quote from gazelle.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   I sent it in.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.920]   They said, oh, you know, this is much better shaped than you were saying.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.080]   We're going to give you more.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.360]   I've never heard a company do that.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.080]   They're going to give you more.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.480]   Once you've got the box full, they pay the shipping and then they send you a check.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.000]   You can get a PayPal credit or better yet.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Get an Amazon gift card.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.200]   If you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, that's worth it because you get 5% more.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.200]   Gazelle.com.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.040]   Sell your gadgets the fast and easy way.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.880]   Really a great, great service.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.480]   Don't give away or bury last year's gadget in the drawer.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.360]   Gazelle, find out why half a million people have raised $50 million by going to gazelle
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.000]   free shipping, fast processing gazelle.com.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.120]   Oh, I know what happened.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.720]   I signed up for branch.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   That's why I got distracted.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.360]   I was like, oh, this is pretty.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.360]   It's cool.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.360]   I like it.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.440]   Sometimes you engage in what you think is going to be a background process, but then
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   it jumps to the foreground.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.920]   It became foreground.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.600]   So is this owned by Twitter?
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.600]   It looks like it might.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.000]   No, it's very tightly integrated.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.080]   Very tightly integrated.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.320]   I never heard of it.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.320]   Golly, there's branch, there's medium, there's all this new stuff.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.680]   It's nice that people are building on top of the things that used to be platforms are
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.240]   now being built on top of.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.240]   Right.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.240]   I guess that's nice.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.120]   I'm not sure I'd want to depend on Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple for my business.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120]   But I guess you can have it.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.320]   I don't think their ideas.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.040]   Safari now has 61% of mobile browser share.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.040]   Oh, I know what I was going to ask you before I get to that.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.360]   I remember now what I was going to talk about.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.040]   We did this on Twitch.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.840]   Presuming there is an iPhone coming.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.240]   And when do we think that's going to be, Renee?
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.240]   August.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.280]   August.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.360]   And you mentioned a little bit about Andy about Apple falling a little bit behind.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.800]   What could Apple do to a new iPhone that would make people sit up and take notice given
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.680]   that their iteration cycles now are so much slower than the industries that they just
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.240]   can't help but fall behind because it's a yearly iteration.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.320]   What could they do to get people to say, Oh, I got to have it.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.480]   This year, I think the only thing they could do would be to introduce a wonderful new service
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.720]   and would, of course, be an iPhone exclusive and would make any person who has an iPhone
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.720]   in their hand that much better to do.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   That's what Siri was.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   That's how much people would have.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.040]   I don't want to talk about Siri so much as the new music service that we're talking about
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.720]   or a new version, a new way of essentially turning your physical location in terms of
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.360]   access to your media and make that irrelevant.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.520]   Because they're certainly not in a cycle where this year they can do a huge change to the
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.720]   operating system.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.560]   There don't seem to be in a cycle.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.320]   I don't know for a fact that they won't be coming out with a larger screen iPhone this
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   year.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.880]   But starting to look as though if you put a hundred bucks in my hand and I had to spend
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.080]   it on a bet, I would bet against it, but I'm certainly not certain about that.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.400]   But we're certainly not going to see anything revolutionary.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.240]   Even if we do see a larger screen iPhone, we will be seeing essentially the version of
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.520]   what we've seen in Android for a year, year and a half now.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.880]   That's the problem, isn't it?
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.520]   And because I really think that the next thing that's the next thing that Apple is going
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.120]   to do hardware wise that will really knock everybody right in their butt is the camera.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:38.880]   I really think that that's their next level up because as good as the iPhone 5 camera
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:45.200]   is and it is best in class for smartphones, there's so much more you could do with a smartphone
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   camera.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:51.280]   Still, the best smartphone camera on the market is still at best an adequate conventional
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.440]   camera.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.080]   Because once you have a sensor that's that small, once you have that kind of problem
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.760]   with light sensitivity, once you have that problem with having to create a lens grouping
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:06.080]   that's about the size of half of a P, there are limits to what you can do with that.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.840]   So I think once Apple just figures out a way to break through a lot of those barriers,
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.960]   there's still a lot of ceiling left above their heads to improve image quality.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:20.360]   And that is in picture taking is one of the most user facing and immediately resonating
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:27.480]   features in a phone that when you take a picture of your kid and that skin is deep and fresh
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:33.440]   and vibrant as opposed to simply detailed and color accurate, that's what makes people
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.800]   think above all else.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.920]   Oh, that's why I want this $199 phone to that other $199 phone.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.160]   Somebody's going to do it and probably won't be Apple, probably Nokia.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.560]   Brian Cluek mentions this in his amazing review of the HTC One on a non tech.com.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.000]   Why isn't anybody giving us manual or at least more manual controls on a smartphone?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.600]   You know, let's let us shoot raw for instance.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.000]   Let us set the shutter speed or the aperture.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.040]   Some of these basic things that even a point and shoot has, I think Apple already wins
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.480]   on image quality.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.640]   I was actually trying to find an answer to that raw question.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.200]   And I haven't gotten as deep into it as I would like.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.960]   But this engineer to what I've spoken to right now says that that's just not something that
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.600]   mobile hardware wasn't any way designed to do.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:26.680]   Because you think about writing 8 megapixel data to a file quickly.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.520]   That's not something that this hardware was designed to do.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.640]   It was designed to take 8 megapixel and translate into something, excuse me, 8 megapixel raw
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.200]   data and translate to something that could be managed by a mobile processor.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.080]   So that's a non trivial problem.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.800]   Then I was asking the follow up question where I'm saying, well, what if a company wanted
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:51.160]   to say have a feature of their camera phone that said, hi, this is raw shooting mode.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.960]   You have to acknowledge that it only shoots at about one frame every five seconds if you
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   do this.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.880]   But if you acknowledge that that's something you're okay with doing, let us do it.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.880]   And I still don't even know that it's even feasible for them to do that because remember
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.760]   that very few I don't think any phone manufacturers are actually manufacturing their own camera
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   hardware.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.960]   They're simply taking whatever components they can find from Sony or wherever.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.000]   So it's a non trivial issue.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.440]   Even Android, they do something that I appreciate what they do by at least the operating system
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.040]   allows you to allows the user to do some sort of manual exposure to manually say, please
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.160]   overexpose this by a couple of stops, please underexpose this by a couple of stops.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.960]   One of the problems with Apple is that they're in internal controls.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.600]   All they can do is really tell the allow the developer to put this button when this button
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.240]   is tapped, take a picture.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   There are a couple of different companies that make that make some nice camera apps and the
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.200]   ones that really throw themselves head and shoulders above the rest are the ones who
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.800]   finally did sort of an iCloud thing where they gave up on Apple expanding the APIs for
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   the camera tool.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.840]   And so we said, we're going to have to build our own.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.840]   And if we build our own, we will have the ability to do live exposure preview and live
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.600]   color temperature preview.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.360]   And that's the only way to get it if they're willing to put in that kind of labor and build
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.360]   those tools themselves.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.960]   Look at how well camera plus sells though.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   There is some demand.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.640]   I don't know about raw because that means you need to post process it.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.120]   And I think that that's a very small, tiny fraction of users.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.920]   But people do want more control.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.760]   Otherwise, camera plus wouldn't be such a huge success.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.360]   I think it's I'm not sure I'll make this very, very quick.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.360]   I think that camera plus is a success.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.720]   Not so much because it gives more control so much as it ties about 10 different $1 utility
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.400]   cool, you $1 utilities into one.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.840]   I think I think in the end, the reason why it doesn't support a camera raw and exposure
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.560]   control is that the person who is taking pictures with this.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.840]   Is not is the person who will settle for whatever this picture this camera is going to take
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   out.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.840]   They prefer it.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840]   They want it to do it that way.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.560]   Renee, what does Apple do with the Fi?
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.160]   First of all, one option is not to do a 5S, but to do a 6.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.880]   So I mean, there's a lot to unpack here.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.920]   And one of the things is that I think what is a real problem and what is a bunch of internet
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   angst?
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.840]   Because if you look at the numbers, the iPhone 5 is selling incredibly well.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.080]   It's increasing its lead over Samsung for Apple in a time when everyone says that Apple
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.360]   is quote unquote doomed.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.200]   And what's exciting about the 5S compared to the 5?
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.880]   How many civilians buy the 5 and the 5S?
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.600]   Usually they buy the 4 and then when the contract expires, they buy the 5 or they bought the
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.600]   4S.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.000]   They skip the 5 when the contract expires, they'll buy the 5S.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Only people like us buy 8 phones in a year.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.960]   So it's a very different problem set.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.840]   But I think Andy is exactly right because when they get to 5S, and I will preface this
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.520]   by saying that last year Apple put out three iPads.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.840]   So I agree with Andy, it's unlikely.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.720]   But in the drawing board, there is an iPhone 5S.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   There's an iPhone 6.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.440]   There's a larger screen iPhone.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.920]   There's a less expensive iPhone and Apple can play those cards as they think best.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.560]   But an iPhone 5S typically has the same hardware, which limits what they can do hardware-wise
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.960]   for things like NFC or inductive charging or optical image stabilization.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.240]   There's a lot of things that keeping the same body limits you on.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.080]   But traditionally, every S devices had either voice control or Siri.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.960]   It's had a much better camera plus a feature like Panorama or something.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.440]   And that's the area that Apple seems really focused on in making a fantastic camera.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:21.240]   The iPhone 5 camera is a miracle of engineering that they got a camera as good, if not better
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.920]   than the 4S, into something as fin as the iPhone 5.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.640]   They could have made a fantastic camera with great battery life if they just kept it the
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   same.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.360]   Apple is apparently to be two-dimensional at some point.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:39.720]   But I think for sure they will do whatever commercial Santa Claus uses an iPhone 4 this
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.320]   year will be that big feature.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.640]   It's encouraging to me to remember that the Retina iPad was actually thicker than the one
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.720]   that came before it.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.200]   So it's not as though this is a holy mandate that we must never make anything that's thicker
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.640]   than its predecessor.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:58.320]   The iPhone 5 disappointed me because I really felt as though it was thinner, strictly as
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.240]   a style thing and it didn't.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:06.360]   And it's nice but everybody, I'm sorry, the third time I'm, I should definitely keep one
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.200]   of my iPhones here so that anytime I need to grab a smartphone as an example, I have
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.200]   an Apple product here.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.200]   What the hell is that?
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.720]   What is that thing you're holding up?
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.560]   But if everybody puts a phone inside a case, I mean, I cannot remember the last time I
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.760]   was out in the real world and I saw people using a naked iPhone of any stripe.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.240]   So I didn't think that was such a big deal.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.880]   If they made it thicker but said we're going to pop in a bigger battery that would have
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.040]   been fine by me.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.440]   I honestly think that if they do make a thicker, if the iPhone 6 for lack of a better word,
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.120]   is a thicker iPhone, it's because finally the argument on the whiteboard went out saying
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.400]   if we make this thing just two millimeters thicker, here is what we can do with the optics
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.920]   of this device.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.320]   Here's what we can do with the make a larger and it's sensor and put it in there and that
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.040]   I think would win the day.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.360]   And you could just see that keynote, you could see Phil Schiller coming out and saying
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.640]   this iPhone gets 20 hours of battery life and takes these pictures all for the same
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.560]   thinness as the iPhone 4s.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.680]   That would be a sound.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.520]   More battery life would be a huge selling point.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.520]   I don't know if they can do it.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.720]   Especially on a sealed device.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   I think you're, I think Andy's right, some software magic.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.520]   I don't know exactly what that would be.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.840]   What if, what if they surprise us all and did do the eye watch and said, not only are
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.720]   you going to have a phone, but we're going to have a device that's on your wrist that
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   will give you signals and information so you don't have to take the phone out of your
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.520]   pocket.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.840]   Would that be?
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.440]   They're apparently working on it, but I don't know if that would be ready at the same time
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.880]   as soon as an iPhone.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:36.080]   I keep, whenever we start talking about the eye watch, I keep thinking about really two
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.280]   different versions of it.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.520]   The version where they say we want to make this essentially the iPod shuffle of the
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.920]   iOS line where this is the one that everybody can afford.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.840]   It doesn't do everything, but it delivers the key, a lot of the key components of the
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.840]   iOS experience.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.280]   That would be like a $50 thing that really does nothing more than, it's a thumper on
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.560]   your wrist and it will display things that are, that's display notifications that are
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.320]   intimately connected with your, with your Mac, with your iPad and your iPhone.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.240]   Remember that the, that the notification center built into iOS and to Mac OS is a very, very
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:15.280]   sophisticated and if we find, if we found out that the four years ago, Apple rewired
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.240]   notifications specifically to support this device, this watch device they intended to
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.440]   do, I don't think would surprise anybody.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.640]   But then the other way of thinking about it is what if they decided to do it as a pricey
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   device.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.240]   And I saw this is the one that everyone can afford.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.480]   It's the one where we're going to make it sexy.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.480]   We're going to make it thin.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.760]   It's going to have, we're going to talk 30 minutes during the keynote event about the
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.600]   special curved screen that nobody else has and no one else can make work and how it's
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.080]   a, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it will, it has a little tiny fingerprint reader on
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.760]   the side of it and it has a brand new sort of immediate networking, networking system.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.160]   But the thing is I have, I find it easier for them to build an attractive device that
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.240]   only does two or three things exceptionally well for not much money.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:02.040]   I find it hard to figure out how they would make a $150 device and how they could put
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:07.760]   features on it that would justify it as an iPhone priced sort of object.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.480]   Would it be enough for this iOS seven, a new flattened iOS?
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.240]   Would that be enough reason for, see, I agree with you, Renee, a lot of this is internet
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   angst.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.320]   iPhone selling just fine.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.480]   But remember, Apple does have to kind of plan for the future and say, how do we keep
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.680]   that demand going?
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.360]   You can't sit back on your haunches.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.760]   If, if we'd learn anything from Blackberry and, and says, lesser degree, Microsoft with
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.520]   its Windows phone, if you just sit back, the parade's going to go by.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.520]   I mean, absolutely.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   And iOS is now the oldest major mobile operating system on the planet.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:44.920]   Blackberry has gone from Java to a J2ME to their new Blackberry 10 system.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:49.160]   So Apple is now the oldest and you know, that might be a good thing or it might be a bad
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   thing.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.160]   But iOS is a continuum.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.200]   And basically they have features and if the feature is ready in time for the next version,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   it gets put into it.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.720]   And if it's not, it goes into the next version.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.080]   And this was a, an unfortunately disruptive year for Apple because Scott Forest all left,
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.840]   Jonathan, I've moved in as head of human interface.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.120]   And apparently they are, you know, behind and they're bringing in all West 10 guys to
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.880]   work on it and how much they managed to finish and how much they managed to package and put
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.120]   in there will be, you know, anyone's guess until they show it off.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.440]   But yeah, it is, it is true.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.840]   There is going to have to be something that Apple is prepping and we've seen signs of
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.840]   that already.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.160]   Like we spoke up before, they have split springboard into springboard and backboards.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.200]   You can potentially have headless apps.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.920]   They've moved XPC over so you can have inter-app communications.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.080]   There's all these things that they've been working on for years but haven't surfaced
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.080]   yet.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.280]   So as soon as those features are ready, you know, maybe, maybe this year, things start
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.840]   to get really interesting with those.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.840]   Right.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.160]   But there's no reason to panic to the this year in August.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.640]   No, no, not, not at all.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.640]   Right.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:55.000]   I'm seeing a lot of overlap in like the, not the situation, of course, but the language
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.040]   of the way we talk about Apple and how they do business and things like the JFK assassination
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:05.040]   where, what, we know, we know, we know, I'm going somewhere with this.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.360]   Again, I knew, I knew that this is like base.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.840]   Sometimes my knowledge is like base jumping.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.680]   You jump, figuring that I know that the backpack on my back can save me, but I'm not
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.720]   going to know until there's the actual infurals.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.160]   In the sense that we all, we kind of forget to see the entire story because it's been
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:29.840]   reduced to the grassy no, back into the left, the pristine bullet, the sniper's nest.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.360]   We don't, we don't, and so we don't really see the entire picture of it.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:39.640]   When we, the more we discuss Apple and the community we do, we talk about, oh, well,
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:44.400]   the fat part of the curve disruption, it be where the hockey puck is going to be, not
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.720]   where the hockey puck is.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.240]   And when we talk about Apple always trying to get to that meaty, most profitable part
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:56.240]   of the bell curve of users, the idea is to make sure that you're not going after a specific
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:02.120]   feature until sometimes some people will use that to describe, well, here's why Apple
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.440]   doesn't put a big screen on their phone because that's not the feature that is in the bell,
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.400]   that fat part of the curve.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.160]   The right way, I think, to interpret that is though to say, to anticipate that the fat
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.040]   part of the curve is not big screen phones, but people are now using their device as something
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.360]   more than a phone, but less than a tablet.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:27.160]   So sometimes Apple does seem to be a little bit behind in that realm because when we,
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.840]   we, when we then take the next step of saying, well, why would Apple want to make any changes?
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.400]   The operating system is still selling incredibly well and we'll put it, they'll put in changes
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.520]   when they're ready.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:42.360]   There is that possibility that they will institutionally forget that here is where people are going
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.040]   and we have to be ready for them by the time we make, we finish our product cycle and actually
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.000]   make this new version of the iPhone.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.440]   So that's, that's the only thing I worry about a little bit because at this point, Apple's
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:59.880]   not making those gradual, the series really the only incremental change I think they've
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.280]   made to the operating system.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.440]   Maybe we'll throw in serious notifications, but the sort of thing that really updates
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.280]   and freshens the entire thing beyond flattening the interface, I don't think we're seeing
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:15.240]   that sort of thing that makes it easier to use, faster to use, more flexible.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.080]   So that's the only thing I'm worried about.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.840]   I reiterate, I don't think that there, there aren't any trouble whatsoever, but as we're
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.760]   discussing this, we have to make sure that we maintain our look on the very, very vast,
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.360]   the whole, the whole landscape of the story and not just these buzz words that even I
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.920]   tend to get fixated on.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.160]   I'm at the point where absolutely no offense to you, Renee.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.720]   So you're actually using the, the word properly, but every time like I'm scanning like the
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.880]   first two paragraphs of an article and I see the word disruption, I'm like, okay, I'm not
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.160]   saying that this person is going to be full of crap.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:51.040]   I'm simply saying that let's just make sure we see, let's just make sure we see that he's
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.880]   using this term correctly and he understands it in the proper context.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.840]   Do you think Facebook home presents a challenge?
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:04.480]   Of course, you can't read as Mark Zuckerberg said, you can't do Facebook home on iOS because
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.240]   Apple just doesn't give you enough hooks into the operating system.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.240]   Maybe it's, I think it reflects the trend where the one part of that event that they
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.960]   had last last week, I was absolutely spot on is that people are losing, just like TV
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.800]   watchers are losing the connection between themselves and the networks and the schedule
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.280]   that shows go on.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.480]   You're not a fan of HBO.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.040]   You're not a fan of the Big Bang Theory.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.680]   You are a fan of the show and you don't really know when it's on.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.280]   You simply get it the way you get it.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.720]   I think people are having on devices or having that same sort of disconnection from apps.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:45.200]   The idea of switching on a phone and seeing a grid of application icons is very much bell
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.960]   bottoms and wide lapels.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.200]   I think this idea of having to think in terms of what app do I need to do that thing I want
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.520]   to do as opposed to what do I want to do?
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.840]   That's very much clear cola and acid wash jeans.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:04.480]   The sooner that any company that's not taking that sort of approach towards the users and
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:07.960]   what they want to do, the more they're going to start to look like something that's available
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.120]   at a yard sale as opposed to a fresh thing that people are going to actually use.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.360]   I absolutely do not want to.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.800]   I would never install Facebook home on my real device.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.760]   That's why I have a separate Android device for testing.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.360]   That's why I have a database with 300 fake names and phone numbers in it and calendars
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.360]   with fake appointments on it.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.360]   I really do that.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.520]   Wow, that's a good idea because I can never show anything without giving out.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.520]   Real phone.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.960]   Yeah, I mean that too.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.840]   It's so easy to make that slip up because you forget.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.680]   It's you know, you filed your story.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.560]   You've got maybe about a 25 minute window while you can still like choose what screenshots
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.520]   you want to include and then you forget that, oh, that's right.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.320]   That actually had a private appointment about someone who agreed to me would be on the condition
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.880]   that no one ever finds out that I saw them.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.360]   That's going to be a very awkward phone.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.840]   Yeah, Andy, I'm going to be a good guy.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.840]   Try it alive, Andy.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   It's interesting.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   There's a lot of minutes.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:05.080]   So yeah, there's that but they're definitely but they're definitely on the right track.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.880]   I think that more companies are going to be doing this.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.960]   This is why Microsoft kind of had their fake little fuss saying that, oh, we all kind of
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.240]   it's kind of interesting isn't it?
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.320]   That this idea that you should turn on your phone and look at your people pictures.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.440]   I wonder what I saw this from.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.360]   Maybe was in Windows phone, which we released last year.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.360]   Yeah, good luck.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.360]   We got winkle bust.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   We got winkle bust.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   Go ahead, Renee.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.360]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.560]   I mean, the idea of app icon launchers goes back to the Newton and to POMOS.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.000]   It's certainly not a new idea.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.400]   It works really well if you're thinking in an app centric context and you could look
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.880]   at Facebook's home in two ways.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.600]   You could say that Microsoft didn't do it right and this is a second attempt or you
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.520]   can say that people don't want to think in a person centric context either.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.120]   I'm sort of in that camp because sometimes I want a camera app and I don't care who I'm
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.560]   taking the photo of and sometimes I want to just get in contact with Andy and I don't
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   care which way I do it.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.600]   I just want to find Andy.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.400]   There's room for both and I don't think any operating system actually is handling the
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.040]   problem of changing push data, sorry, pull data to push data.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.880]   But what I think was interesting with Facebook home is you've got this amazing design talent.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.000]   You've got Mike Mattis who did Delicious Library originally and you ironically kind
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.760]   of kickstarted this whole rich textured look.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.760]   I didn't know that.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.800]   Oh, that's that's who's working on home.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.900]   Yeah, Eric saying from the Android team and Mike Mattis from recently from Delicious
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:36.320]   Monster and he was a push pop press and now Facebook and Facebook home is a little push
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.000]   poppy because you can throw your friend.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.840]   It's almost like angry birds with your Facebook friends.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.560]   You can throw them up and down and and around like that.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:49.400]   It's there's I think the Facebook phone will be compelling to anyone for whom Facebook
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.160]   is the primary reason to use the internet almost like an AOL phone would have been 10
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.560]   years ago or a Mice based phone five years ago.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.240]   But it's going to be a weird experience because if you buy the HTC first which isn't called
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.840]   a Facebook phone, you'll get a full Facebook home.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:08.240]   If you download it, you will only get a partial Facebook home because it took HTC's engineering
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:13.120]   team to do a bunch of tight OS level integration to get things like chatter head popping up.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.400]   I'm disappointed to hear that because I thought I thought it was just a launcher and that the
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   hooks would be there.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.640]   But it's more than a launcher obviously.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.400]   Yeah, it's not sense but it's a and it's not as deep as sense but it's a sense like or a
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.400]   touch with.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:29.400]   I did buy the HTC one and it'll come in about a week and a half and I was hoping that I
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:33.840]   could put home on there at least try it but it won't be the full experience.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:39.160]   And it's odd because you know like I don't my friend my I opened up my news feed to kind
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.520]   of get a sense of what it looked like because in the Facebook commercials and the Facebook
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.680]   presentation, it's all these beautiful people doing beautiful things and I got a bunch of
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   cat themes.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.080]   And they're and drunken photographs and I think this is going to be a business for designers
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:57.600]   you know making stock art for Facebook home because it's if I go to Facebook, can I see
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.600]   it at Facebook?
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.560]   Do they have like a simulation with my my own pictures in it?
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.440]   No, but you can watch the commercial and you can see them blocking people over head
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.320]   compartment half naked people over right now.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.000]   The commercial is so very weird.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   It is interesting.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   We really I keep seeing the the the seeds of a new revolution every time that I see people
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.880]   interacting with their phones.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:26.680]   Was in a I was in a car just yesterday going to going to a lunch and the person next to
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:32.720]   me had a iPhone 5, which we all know and love, which I think everybody hearing this conversation
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.600]   thinks and agrees is the easiest to use iPhone, excuse me, a phone operating system out there
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.200]   in the east most user centric idea.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.400]   And she was telling me, could you help me with my iPhone because I can't I just don't
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.880]   have a phone call comes in and I don't know who called.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.240]   I don't know how to get at my messages because and I really and it just sort of sharpens
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:56.400]   my awareness that there are people who it so I but I want to get I want to know who called
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   me.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.720]   What after I go to to get at that information?
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.280]   This is the sort of person for whom she wants to wake up that screen and see here are the
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:08.480]   things that have happened in the past 30 minutes or anticipating here are the things that we
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.880]   that we are after watching you operate this phone for a week.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.200]   We know that you're interested in if you're holding a device that's in motion at 2 p.m.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.040]   on a workday, we think that you're going to want to see this this this and this.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:26.720]   So the the the grid of icons I think is just getting weaker and weaker and weaker and it's
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.440]   starting to look a little bit like that.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:34.440]   Remember the remember the last the the last wave of film cameras uses that thing was actually
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:39.520]   called APS that was weird like new film cartridge that you could drop in and you could take
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.360]   a advanced photo system.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.360]   There you go APS and even even even if you're in the middle of the role it'll rewind or
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.120]   retract and you can reset it'll set the ISO automatically and really great ideas but if
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:56.080]   they're as revolutionary as it was it was trying to continue on a mode a technology that
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.160]   was not moving forward.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:03.120]   So a terrific last gas but it was going to be digital starting from two years from now
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:08.400]   no matter what happened and I think that maybe it's not doing away with app icons but
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.160]   at least not making them the center of the concierge of the experience that's really
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.280]   going to be what every operating system is going to have to do starting a couple years
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.280]   from now at least.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.200]   I think it might be time to tear it down and start completely start over and acknowledge
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:27.300]   that you know it does change and what people's expectations change and the phone really
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.000]   ought to be easier to use.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.800]   I'm yeah you know I'm I'm very interested to look at this and I might I guess I might
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.760]   have to buy an HTC first because is that the only one that this will be the the full
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.240]   experience on the first one.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.280]   Yes the first full it's a crappy phone.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.200]   It's like a mid-range Android.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.960]   It's not even Facebook branded so they won't even get any halo effect from Facebook.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.920]   I mean it's interesting from a Facebook perspective because up until now more social has been
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:57.040]   migratory people went from friends to to my space to Facebook and there's been some
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.320]   rumblings that cool kids are not as hot on Facebook as they used to be.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.320]   They're not.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.560]   Kids aren't at all.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.600]   No and it's a it's a web centric company in a mobile centric age and it's really smart
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.320]   that they buy things like Instagram and they try to spend themselves here because they're
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.560]   going to need and the way they did it was so interesting and I did an aliens analogy
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.440]   previously is that they almost like face huggered Google they just stuck on to Android and injected
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.880]   their DNA and it's not a complete OS they don't they don't do to Google exactly what
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.840]   Google did to you know the whole reason for Android was that Google was paranoid they'd
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:33.000]   get locked out of the internet by Microsoft first and later Apple and you know one day
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.520]   Android might become a Google plus and Google now box you know not really an open device
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.960]   anymore and Facebook getting their presence into mobile now seems like really good timing
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:47.720]   and a really good way to make sure that they have access to some part of mobile going forward.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:52.120]   App launcher this is from the if you go to Facebook.com/time you get a full tour of the
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:57.560]   features here's the app launcher get right to Facebook Instagram and other essentials.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:05.760]   See that's the interesting thing when you listen to that presentation like how much longer
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:10.680]   the idea is to I think is going to be as the months go by with all these monthly updates
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.840]   to make sure that you never go into the app launcher to launch a camera app why would
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:19.480]   you when when Instagram is so well integrated into Facebook now that you would never want
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:25.440]   to use an outside messaging app or an outside app for anything because why would you want
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.360]   to we've integrated that so nicely inside Facebook.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.560]   I think it's I think it's the same reason why Apple wants to have like their campus be
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:37.480]   one giant walled circle that their employees can't escape from what why would you go out
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.200]   for a burrito we make wonderful burritos here.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.240]   Oh I'll take that dry cleaning for you.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.080]   No need to leave campus to get your drawings cleaned.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.560]   It worked on the web they walled off the browser now they can wall off Android a little
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   bit.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.560]   It's a good strategy.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.600]   It's it's a backwards strategy because it's like AOL but remember who used AOL all
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.600]   the people who were confused by the Internet.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.160]   Yeah and it was easy right they could figure it out.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.920]   What if you I don't know somebody said in the chat room and I think this is probably
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.400]   true there'll be a cyanogen mod with Facebook home.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.400]   I can put on some phone.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:15.240]   Now that's now that really does give one pause the whole purpose for the cyanogen project
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.400]   is that you have like a two or three year old phone that's not getting ice cream sandwich
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:23.440]   not getting the latest builds and you really want Google now so much that you're willing
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.520]   to like root your phone and get this done.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.760]   I'm not sure how much work I'd be willing to do to give Facebook more access to my life.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:35.000]   I think that would be an indication of some sort of disorder.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.040]   What yeah you're right.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   I did but you know at least at least Facebook cares if I live or die.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.880]   You know who should really be doing this is Apple and I would hope that iOS eight or maybe
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:50.120]   this is maybe this is what's going on with iOS seven would be a complete step back and
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:54.760]   throw everything out and how should a phone look now now that we have all that horsepower
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:48:00.000]   we have that screen we have users that are maybe looking for something a little different.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.880]   What should it be now what I'm hoping for is you know Apple has the same problem that
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.440]   Windows had they have hundreds of millions of users that they really don't live the drag
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.520]   behind them and I'm hoping is maybe a blackberry ten style approach where that we like the
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:17.960]   inanimate approach where that app drawer is there and you know that can be your default
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.600]   home screen but with one swipe you can be in this area right now we have a spotlight
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.240]   screen that really doesn't do much but sit there and blank at us and there's so much
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:30.440]   more that they could do it to slowly create a next to like in this version there's a super
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:34.520]   spotlight page and the next version that's more of the home screen experience.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.920]   There's a lot of opportunity there's a lot of opportunity and that's the cool thing if
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.120]   they were to get rid of springboard or replace with something a little bit more modern that's
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:46.440]   something they could do without having to pull the rug out from the entire experience.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:51.440]   I mean for like this is this is the screenshot from Google now that I was using and just
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.560]   shows shows people how cool it is that I didn't have to set anything up just simply
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.560]   here it is.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.560]   It knows that I've I've I've scheduled an appointment with the rest set a calendar appointment
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:07.000]   for I need to go to this place in Chicago at 1 p.m. and it also knows that about four
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.640]   hours after that I have a flight so here's a map with directions how to get to my appointment
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:15.680]   here's my flight status for that sort of thing and but people don't understand is that
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:20.760]   this is actually I don't need to have Android 4.2 running on my phone it is really just
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.000]   the Google search app that I can simply download independently from whatever version of Android
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.080]   I'm running so Apple could decide to not revolutionize the entire operating system but to simply
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:36.760]   revolutionize their lock screen revolutionize their home screen and even just that would
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.640]   really kick.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:48.840]   I'm not not I would say when necessarily kick the kick iOS into the second decade of the
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:54.360]   21st century but it would definitely be at least in 2009 we'd definitely be in the Obama
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.320]   era of mobile interfaces if they were to do something as simple as that.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:04.120]   Well give us Obama give us hope that's all we want to hope and change hope and change.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:09.000]   I'm not going to say anything.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.640]   Let's take a break come back with more Renee Richie's here I'm more dot com and Iinaco
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.840]   Chicago Sun times and Iinaco dot com I should start using in not com should not that's like
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.720]   that's the site now.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.920]   It is your portable for everything you need to know about the NCA bracket coverage or
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   have another.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:31.200]   That's Tom Merritt said I've just about finished filling out my brackets.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.920]   Is it too late?
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:40.800]   I H N A T K O dot com I have no idea how to spell it.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.640]   I love that mnemonic.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:46.040]   It's it's you know I'm always delighted when someone I've never met can pronounce my name
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.480]   correctly I feel as though I need to have like some sort of like you know some some
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.720]   sort of blue Peter badge for them say you've won your pronounce and not goes last name
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.720]   correctly badge.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.640]   But it's 10% off at masking Robin.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.920]   Are you the kind of guy and I know people like this who say well no it's pronounced
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.880]   just like it's spelled.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.720]   No I was 12 years old before I could pronounce it correct.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.800]   But it is and I want to say pronounce just like it's spelled.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:16.200]   Yeah and the and the the dannable thing is that like my my of course it was my father's
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.640]   name and it was my father's father's name before that but he came from Western Pennsylvania
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.840]   so he was raised to like a pronounced ours a little bit more solidly.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.840]   But and an echo an echo is how you pronounce it if you grew up in the Boston area.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:34.600]   So although it pleased it pleased him to know when being of him being a father to learn
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:38.600]   that Apple had actually hardwired the correct pronunciation of an out go into the operating
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:45.520]   system until I said but but all these computers they're pronouncing our family name wrong.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.960]   Well how do they put out a Siri pronounce it.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:54.600]   Try it if you if you do text to speech cap spell my name correctly and capitalized the
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.440]   capitalizer correctly it will actually pronounce it correctly.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:02.680]   They I got an email from an engineer and sent them five recordings of my voice saying it.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.160]   So it weren't it weren't.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:13.040]   Yeah because La Porte is actually as easy as as it would seem pronounced in a variety
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.040]   of unusual ways.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:22.720]   He is not wrong that ball Renee would know how to pronounce it because
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:28.400]   it is a French Canadian name does not La Porte La Porte.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.200]   That's the Beverly Hills store version.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.880]   Yeah La Porte.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.880]   No it's just law port very simple.

[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:01.880]   No I lied because of course it is doesn't work on your Sony Vega your grand Vega it doesn't
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:05.760]   work on pretty much every smart TV I should say.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:11.120]   You can also try it on your Sony playstation 3 that's how I watch often the Apple TV's
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:16.720]   got a great new Hulu plus interface which is spectacular.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:23.240]   Roku's got it mobile phones tablets and more Xbox 360 and what do you get well you well
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:27.160]   by the way one of the things I really like is if I start watching on one device I could
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:34.040]   pick up right where I left off on any other device which is fabulous Hulu plus includes
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:38.000]   all the current stuff that you want to watch.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.560]   The daily show that's how I watch it.

[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.040]   Here's the voice Sasha Allen.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.680]   I like the clips because I don't want to for instance Saturday Night Live I don't usually
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.240]   watch the whole show but I can go see the clips on it and I love it.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.120]   Look how many I don't know how I got three thousand seven hundred seventy six shows in
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   my queue.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:25.760]   I'm a little behind but you can see the shows I watch.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.400]   It's just fantastic 30 rock.

[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:33.760]   click the banner on the twit dot TV home page so I was about to say Safari jumps to 61%
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.760]   of mobile browser share to confirm what you say and Renee which is that there's no reason
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:43.960]   to panic at Apple yet they are still dominant by a long shot number two the Android browser
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:51.680]   with 21% opera mini with 8% chrome with 2% IE which is as far as I know only use on Windows
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:56:00.400]   phone 1.99% blackberry only use on blackberry phone 0.91% so 61% percent is in some ways
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   more than it seems it's almost triple the next biggest browser interesting data from
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:12.800]   both of those charts though that people do not care about alternative browsers at all
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:17.120]   right the number one browser is the browser you get stock with iOS the number two mobile
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:22.280]   browser is the browser you get stock with Google on the desktop side the number one
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:26.920]   browser is still internet explorer the browser you get stock with the most popular operating
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:32.280]   system on the planet interesting though internet explorers number one with 55% but Safari is
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:38.960]   not in the top three it's it's five percent on the desktop and that also doesn't that
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:45.240]   point to it's I love tearing apart this data because I feel as though it's such a glaring
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:52.680]   it's such an interesting piece of data that the phone platform that is not in any way
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:59.760]   the most dominant mobile platform on the planet is kicking but on on web usage by a
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:04.520]   three to one margin on the number two number two user we're asked when you go to the desktop
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:08.880]   that more accurately reflects the percentage of operating systems that are that are actually
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:14.600]   out there so it really does teach you that it's not just a case of how much better iPhone
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:20.040]   sell in the United States to compare the competition how much better Android devices sell in certain
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:25.040]   countries it really does show that people who buy iPhones use the web differently or use
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.840]   them for different sorts of things that Android users tend to buy their things for it maybe
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.320]   it has to do with the fact that there's so many budget Android phones out there the people
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:37.080]   who are not buying these as a web tool as an Instagram tool as something to spend a lot
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:41.440]   of their mobile minutes on a mobile bandwidth on a traditional it really is just a phone
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:47.060]   for them whereas people have that deeper connection to their iOS devices interesting
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:54.120]   aren't going to see that which is basically wrong that says that I messages is opaque to
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:58:00.280]   law enforcement and there's a good response from the Cato Institute the libertarians over
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:08.120]   the Cato Institute said that's just DEA disinformation yes the CNET reports based on a note from
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:12.960]   the drug enforcement administration that they sent out to law enforcement intelligence note
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:17.560]   that says because I messages are encrypted and sent through Apple servers a conventional
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:22.520]   wiretap installed at the cellular's carrier facility isn't going to catch them however
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:27.160]   that's that's exactly what you would expect what they don't mention but the Cato Institute
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:32.760]   does point out is if you can recover your password after losing it from Apple which you
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:39.440]   can then it's Apple has every ability to get into your iMessages and of course a subpoena
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:45.120]   will deliver that information up to law enforcement immediately go ahead go ahead
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.360]   I'm sorry so we had our security guy Nick are not looking to the story to because he
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.760]   found it fishy and it looks like they didn't get iMessage just because they weren't looking
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:57.440]   at iMessage they had a big bunch of stuff and they said oh why are we missing some things
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:01.640]   and oh those were sent over iMessage not sent over SMS that doesn't mean that in a heartbeat
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:05.560]   they can't turn around and say oh look what's happening with these iMessage is sort of a
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:08.600]   we don't even know they might well be able to unencrypt them but it doesn't matter because
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:12.760]   if they want them they can get them directly from Apple just as they can get your Gmail
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:16.680]   and everything else from the other companies you know i don't i don't feel as though there was
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:21.880]   an ulterior motive to this to this alert going out i but it's i just i think it really kind of
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:27.160]   transparently shows off the fact that the the infrastructure for law enforcement to get access
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:32.680]   to text messages is very very old very very well established and very very routine
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:37.080]   they essentially have a drive-through window when they want access SMS
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:41.160]   brass iMessage is new enough that they haven't figured out the routines they make it very very
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:46.040]   easy to get that information as part of the normal scrum although the Cato Institute does point out
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.920]   that in fact law enforcement probably loves iMessage is because as law enforcement is often
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:56.600]   complained cell carriers only store text messages for a few days and some don't retain the content
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:02.920]   at all whereas we can presume that iMessage is restored for quite some time very handy if you're
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.320]   investigating it a crime it was just it was mostly i think misreported when the initial statement
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:12.120]   went out i think cnet misunderstood what was going on the fact that law enforcement can't wire
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:18.200]   tap iMessage does not mean they can't read them do not assume do not go out and start using iMessage
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.960]   is for your drug deals it's because they didn't doesn't mean they can't and and and also as bad as
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:31.080]   as bad as the the situation excuse me however you want to interpret the word bad as as as it is for
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:36.840]   a to allow law enforcement to get access to your personal and private communications
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:43.240]   usually that has to be fought and won in court right uh so that the fact that they already have
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.800]   the it's not just the technology to get access to your text messages it's also the fact that we have
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.640]   asked the law enforcement is asked for and receive the ability to do that under the right
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:57.080]   circumstances and sometimes this is something that that tends to vary and this is where i make
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:03.720]   sure i don't try to wander into niele uh to in deni patel's uh to her frostbabs yes exactly uh no
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.600]   no i mean that you know he's he's a lawyer and he knows this stuff and i i a person who talks to
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:14.040]   lawyers and tries to understand this stuff sometimes it really is as simple as okay now is this to this
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:21.400]   communications technology is it one in which the user instigates the communication deliberately or is
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:26.120]   it one in which they are receiving information without asking for it because those are in fact
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.400]   two different legal situations in which we knew which we'd have to follow two different
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:34.440]   procedures so sometimes it's not just the technology that needs to catch up it really is at some point
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.920]   someone putting of words on a very very nice piece of paper and finally it weighs on place
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.080]   very important that says yes it is in fact okay for the government to do this yeah i don't know you
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:49.480]   know what what kind of legal authority they need apple does say as nikar not points out in his i'm
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:55.240]   more article that uh in their privacy policy that they may need to disclose personal information
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.840]   if required by law so apple is not it is not going to stand above that and i wouldn't expect
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:07.320]   them to either and i love i love uh nik quotes uh security researcher moxie marlin spike and i
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:13.400]   just like saying his name so if you don't want it found don't create it to begin with exactly or
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.720]   be you know i think this just means there's still gonna be a good business in burner phones
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:24.440]   going forward but it is it really is interesting though because if if a local law enforcement really
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.960]   wants that sort of that sort of stuff they'll figure out a way to get it sure um there was
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:34.440]   there was a for instance san francisco uh rock music clubs are not required to maintain security
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:40.440]   footage of the people inside and outside their establishments uh the science if i'm remembering
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.760]   the story correctly san francisco police department tried to get that as a as a requirement but they
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.880]   didn't get that so what they started doing is simply putting that into uh the permit process for
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:55.720]   getting uh for getting your permits to operate the operate a club uh and so you actually really
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:00.280]   do have to fight very very hard to get that clause removed in order to open up your business and
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:07.320]   most people this just not worth their while uh there's one club owner uh uh jwz who's uh one of the
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:12.120]   people who built netscape and took cash out the right type and and and built a rock club you know
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:18.040]   it's a dna lounge oh it's a billionaire exactly the dna lounge and had a blog post uh just uh just
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.640]   recently about how he got a phone call from the police there oh just uh it looks like to remind
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:27.640]   you sir that uh you are required to keep your records and turn them over us uh no we don't oh
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:33.240]   yes sir i think you'll find that no we don't have to do that and then and of course the either
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:37.640]   the police was the this person was either completely clueless as to what the actual law was or they're
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.480]   hoping that they're talking to somebody who did not remember that they they're not required to do
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:47.080]   this so it is exceptionally tricky so you remember ron johnson used to run apple retail
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:56.040]   yep yeah and get a little bit of that magic ron johnson touch yeah remember him remember him
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.600]   very dusted and scattered either and young yeah because you know he would have made any
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.840]   what he did for apple he did a good job for apple and then then left apple to run jc penny and of
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:09.560]   course apple's gone through some people since not really found anybody to replace him apparently
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:15.720]   ron's out at jc penny after less than two years on the job he's uh he's stepping down so previous
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:23.000]   guys coming back huh the previous ceos come back to jc penny i don't know maybe uh ron johnson should
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:30.040]   come back to apple they're both single again you know they they've dated around different time
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:36.040]   it's a different place yeah it's like a niel simon play isn't it they they divorce they find new
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.120]   couples they they go they get dumped by their their new partners
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:44.920]   and then they go back to the relationship that they knew they were supposed to be in for the rest
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.800]   their lives to begin with i'm just saying girls and stockin al and stalker chanting i think
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:57.320]   i'm just saying those by on bbc he's available girls wasn't wasn't still i don't think that he
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.280]   should be uh embarrassed about the about the failure or certainly not uh you know made fun of
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:07.640]   for the failure i really respected that gutsy move about hey i'm at apple right now and i'm
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:13.400]   responsible for one of the if you name four titanic successes apple has had in the previous in the
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:19.000]   past ten years i am singular you're singularly responsible for one of those successes and saying
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.560]   nope i want to quit this job and take a job and have absolute down on its luck 10 minutes away from
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:31.640]   death uh retail establishment and take that new challenge instead there are not a whole lot of
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.680]   people who are already could don't need to work another day in their lives who would say i want
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.840]   to do something that's exceptionally hard that is not even likely that i'm going to succeed at this so
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:48.920]   marissa mire at yahoo that was a that was exactly that kind of move cannot can she save yahoo um
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:54.520]   just for fun i don't know if you saw it the untold story behind apple's 13 000
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:05.480]   operating system um this is a cnet story design specs contracts page after page of schematics
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:15.400]   and code all about uh apple's first disc o s of uh surfaced um these are 35 year old documents
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:20.920]   that it might be kind of fun to read if you if you visit uh they're uh housed at the digibarne
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:27.960]   which is up in the sanichris mountains which is really a cool computer museum um it's uh
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:35.480]   bruce don uh dammer uh dammer of the digibarne says apple was in trouble apples in trouble they
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.880]   were loading the operating system from cassette you had to wait and wait some of us remember this
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:45.800]   uh for it to load and it was often unreliable you'd load it and it collapsed they needed a
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.240]   disc operating system um but they didn't have anybody in house
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:07:02.200]   so the company looked elsewhere to find somebody to build it and uh all of that is uh is documented
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:07.560]   it's really cool it's really a very interesting uh story here if you if you like apple history
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:14.920]   um 13 000 for a disc operating system seems like a good deal no royalties either
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.920]   no royalties that's the that was the microsoft way wasn't it someone could have had his own pink
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:24.280]   tesla today had he asked for their esperrealities shepherdson microsystems they gave him $5,200 up
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:32.280]   front promised him $7,800 on delivery and that's all you get and it took up 35 days to write it
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:41.480]   apple's first DOS 35 days kind of amazing and remember i guess you're you're you have to run
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   the was floppy which was a strange interface um i just sat down and started writing
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:57.160]   lotan said it was written on punch cards put into a mini computer assembled the output was paper
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:05.400]   taped then we proceeded to debug it hmm unbelievable and that's only really it's 35 years is not that
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:10.760]   long that's what that's how we did it in those days and isn't it amazing to remember that there
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:15.880]   was a time when a guy could write an operating system yeah it's like okay yeah
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:25.320]   the project was based on specs app uh that was gave lotan for how to create a boot disc uh
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:30.840]   including a hand drawn diagram for the was controller yeah well say this is how i do it you
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:36.200]   just do it like this now you want you want to make sure you hold the etch a sketch level when
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:41.000]   you carry this home on the source guy got to go to the digibar and see this is up in the mountains
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.160]   it's hard to get to but it's worth it uh the margins of the source code have a series of
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:52.600]   notes explaining what's going on there the the remarks are handwritten uh things randy wiggington
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:09:03.480]   i mean this is so cool lotan is still around he's 69 he says it was a career highlight back in 1978
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.240]   pretty cool story a good story from cnet thank you for assuring that with us
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:18.920]   um written by um daniel uh turdaman at cnet maybe we should get this would be good to get this guy on
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.000]   talk to him a little bit about how you write an operating system in 35 days
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   uh also as long as we're talking about coding um brian Krebs who i love and who's had more than his
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.440]   sheriff trouble with hackers uh has an article on his blog Krebs on security who wrote the
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:48.440]   flashback worm for o s 10 taking advantage of a jaga java uh flaw um he quotes f secures uh
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.080]   broadrick ean a calino saying flashback is not only the most advanced but also the most successful
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:10:02.360]   o s 10 malware we have ever seen and brian does the work he's very good at this going back in time
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:09.320]   about how this is written by mavuk from black seo.com
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:18.360]   uh mav double ok he does the who is i'm a vuk finds a guy named maxim
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:26.680]   selekhanovich in seransk more adovia in the russia so it gives me excuse to use
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:35.560]   russia that's it. russia spazibo um i love this. i thought it was going to be one of those caribbean
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:43.160]   hackers oh no mosh i just did he get the right russian hacker? it's a russian hacker
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:52.520]   a russian hacker. ipad price cuts rene richy does that mean a new ipad is in fact imminent or what?
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:59.240]   i i heard they were trying for april but then i haven't heard anything since so either they're
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.680]   still trying for april or april didn't work out so good and they're trying for something later but
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:10.120]   there yeah price cuts is a good indicator there's some supply chain stuff it's a good indicator but
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:16.760]   it's it's so hard to tell these days because they apple is so fast that going from not doing
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:22.520]   it to doing it that it's it's really criminology like Andy described earlier and as you said last
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:27.800]   week and you proven right that ipad mini the fact that they couldn't get a trademark on mini
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:33.000]   was just a little uh clerical issue which has apparently been resolved and the patent office has
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.480]   now withdrawn objections to the ipad mini trademark as you said as you predicted that was a tempest
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:44.680]   in a teapot nothing wrong just kindly direct everyone to nile patel's post on the matter because i don't
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.480]   want to get in his cross here as either yeah he's the guy he's the guy when it comes to ip law he's
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:59.080]   an actual lawyer as opposed to us um there did you read the interesting kensiegal blog post he's the
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:05.800]   ad guy who spent a lot of time working for apple and was a little critical about apple's naming
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.480]   conventions i was too we all were with the new ipad what the hell is that
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:17.320]   um and what's what's the reason and he says you know and he's an expert in branding and naming
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:24.440]   apparently that uh the the s designations are a mistake they're confusing that the naming of the
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:32.360]   ipad is confusing he says what's wrong with ipad one two three four nothing you agree he gets
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:37.560]   a 18 it gets awkward yeah i guess i you know i i have to say i mean this guy is a creative
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:43.720]   director he's uh he worked at apple and next he named the iMac named the iMac so he came up with the
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.880]   i yeah i think they said what's jobs wanted to call it the mac man or something and he talked
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.240]   him down from that his book is called insanely simple the obsession that drives apple's success
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:57.960]   um you know i have to say i kind of agree with him and we were kind of used to it this is the
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:03.960]   thing about naming is even if it's a bad name like ipad which let's face it was a terrible name
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:09.080]   once you kind of absorb it it's a great name there's nothing wrong with it there's a particular
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:14.440]   problem when you're talking about something as stylish as a as a phone um there's a reason why
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.240]   hollywood screenwriters are told i know that you were the show runner on cheers for eight seasons
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.160]   please don't put that on your resume because people will think you're too old and you don't know how
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:28.200]   to write modern comedy uh so there comes a point which when you talk about oh it's the iphone eight
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.440]   it's the iphone nine it's the iphone ten that's not all you would you would much rather have you
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:39.880]   know it's the new no kia whack all right wak well htc they named their phone the one even a real world
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.120]   that's well they have the nexus one and then the one x and now the one they're keeping it at the
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.720]   first digit forever it's always going to be one but even microsoft has this issue i mean look at
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.720]   microsoft's windows naming conventions for a while they tried years then they realized well though
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.040]   that's terrible because if it's windows 98 in the year 2000 it's just old sounding and now they're
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:01.480]   doing numbers windows eight but that won't last you know that uh so it's it's hard this stuff is hard
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:06.360]   to yeah but his point and i think he's right is they should have had better names for the ipad maybe
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:12.280]   not numeric but the new ipad is really hard for everybody to distinguish between on the other hand
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.120]   i mean it's it's so easy to overthink that sort of thing where everyone they first announced the
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:21.080]   name everyone said oh my god they named them for a feminine hygiene product exactly and you get used
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:26.600]   to it and now ipad is you know it's it's it's an ipad it's called the ipad because that's what it is
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.000]   just like when you name your kid you know sylvester people win to the first week and then
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.280]   second week's like oh well that because that's clearly that's his name because his name is
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:39.640]   so so best right my point exactly you get used to names um but and people now kind of think well
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.680]   all tablets are pads but that but that was not the case until it was named the ipad
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:52.520]   um the s designation he says is kind of a problem um and i wouldn't be surprised to see apple drop
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:57.800]   drop the number and the s this year and do something new it's both a blessing and a curse i think
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:04.840]   originally the iphone 4s s was for speed sorry the 3 g s the s was for speed 4s was for syri and it
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.880]   kind of set expectations that yes it's not a new casing it's not a completely new foam but look
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.960]   it's got all these extra features so it's got a letter attached to it but that's his point is
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:21.800]   that it yes stands for sam san can bite a shiny apple one you don't scare me that can be any
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:28.600]   pro sam san can bite that s uh but he does point out that it kind of leads to this story which we've
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:34.360]   now all adopted of the tick tock development cycle and he says you know my vote meaningless as it is
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.080]   is that the next iphone should be an iphone 6 if it's worthy of being a new model it should be
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.880]   worthy of having its own number and you don't really necessarily want to underscore the presses
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.920]   desire to make this tick tock be you know written in stone it doesn't have to be a tick tock
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.760]   and one of his arguments though is that people aren't going to buy the next one but again you're
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:57.000]   in two years like contract cycles in the u.s. i'm in three year contract cycles in Canada so no
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.120]   normal person is buying every year's model although maybe if it was five six seven yeah but we'd be
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:07.160]   on iphone seven this year if they kept it in two one two if you could absolutely to incentive but
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.160]   then you have to think oh it's not really it's it's not really that good of an upgrade apple or ripped
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:16.200]   me i mean they're they're always sort of on the walking the fine line between expectations and you
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:21.720]   know it's tough and naming gets harder because all the good names get taken iphone iphone 10 with
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.520]   an x that'll be the whoo and and you know that was the point Paul Thorett made when we were talking
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:32.760]   about windows numbering his games he says apple hasn't changed o s 10 for years yeah well but then
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.960]   again they're calling it lion and then mountain lion and they're really not i there their times i
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:45.320]   really have to remember is are we on 10.7 or 10.8 right right well when we're on 10.15 Alex and it'll
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.360]   all be great it's i think the the eventual goals to make every product name look like an IP address
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:56.120]   well even car manufacturers have this trouble and you get some terrible car names too so i you
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:01.720]   know i don't know but the alternative i mean blackberry for years had 9,000 9,900 9,980 right
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:08.120]   which was incomprehensible to humans and now nokia has lumiya 526 27 28 20 and then just the brands
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:13.160]   get so long um there's something nice about just being iphone yeah they're doing they're doing the
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.880]   same thing that uh that apple had to do when they had to have separate skUs for sears and for every
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:23.080]   major retailer i think they're just an announcement of the nokia 928 which is a Verizon version of
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:31.560]   the nokia 920 so so uh intel yesterday announced a 20 gigabit per second thunderbolt people may
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:36.680]   not remember that thunderbolt is not an apple product it's an apple intel product just as fire
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:41.480]   wire was and that the original thunderbolt was not copper based as the thunderbolt is currently
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:49.320]   on mac and tashes but was uh fiber optic based and capable of a lot more throughput so the new
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:57.800]   thunderbolt called named falcon ridge uh is capable of 4k video file transfer and display so you could
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:06.040]   you could watch a 4k movie streaming over it 20 gigabit per second it is downward compatible that's
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:12.600]   good with the current version of thunderbolt technically the current version is uh uh 10
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.480]   gigabits per second half is fast that's the one you will need this for our retina display of future
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:24.120]   leo yeah we do don't get all excited though it won't be in production till 2014 and who knows if
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:30.040]   apple will ever include it i'm jumping in a tardis win a 2014 and bringing us both back retina
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:34.920]   to thunderbolt displays but jack good news is jack got his 30 dollar thunderbolt cable it's
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.840]   there it's here just bought it yesterday look at that 30 dollars ladies and gentlemen
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:44.120]   30 dollars for yeah a foot of cable is there any is there a chip in there anything that just
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.800]   yeah there's actually two chips so it was so one on either side of the thunderbolt so there is
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:53.400]   some smarts yeah i fix it's done a tear down of it and it's not just copper right right but
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:19:02.440]   to go with the new two terabyte uh uh drive that about good for a mac for a mac yeah you had a mac
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:08.680]   i say you build that hackintosh well that has a two thunderbolt uh ports on it as well all right
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:16.040]   nice and in my laptop is my mac oh what am i thinking of course yeah you have a mac laptop
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.640]   everybody here has a map we buy windows in the business side business division they're all dels

[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.800]   the fact that Alex Lindsey was gonna be on but his uh something happened to his bandwidth in dc and
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:56.360]   and uh so uh i guess you know some drone was eating it all up so and when Alex Lindsey cannot get
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:02.520]   video streaming from a location you know that stuff is going down he won't do it yes that's right
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:09.320]   especially if the location is the white house usa 1600 pennsylvania i don't know he wasn't i

[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:40.040]   two picks so one if you're listening today uh because i think remember you'll remember a few weeks
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:46.280]   ago when marvel comics and comicsology tried to give away 700 number one issues from marvel's current
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:53.400]   and back catalog and the the servers at comicsology did a super heroic effort but it lasted about a
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:26:00.280]   day before everything just went properly so they're relaunching that promotion with a sort of a
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:07.320]   sort of a scheduled scheduled thing so if you go to promo.comxology.com today good
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:14.120]   monday before midnight eastern time today you can secure a a certified slot in line
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:20.520]   and they will start letting people in on timed intervals to get access and do to get to grab
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.920]   all those comics and once you do i i was able to get in like on day one of the previous promotion and
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:29.320]   it really is you simply seven her there's seven her comics they're all on one page
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:34.760]   they are free you tap the buy button and you own it and forever even after the promotion is over
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:39.080]   with so it works whether you're using the marvel comics app or the comicsology app and another tip
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:44.040]   is that you don't have to download those comics the day that you're buying them so long as the
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:49.240]   transaction goes through and it sees that okay you have purchased uh amazing spider-man annual number
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.480]   one that's it you don't have to download anything just keep on going and that works but again you
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:58.840]   have to do you if you're you have to do this before midnight eastern today tuesday and they will start
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.720]   sending out invitations a couple days from now where you'll again you'll be given a window in which you
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.600]   can uh go to the site and uh and download whatever you want or buy whatever you want is it kind of
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.960]   unlimited i mean everybody can do this everybody can do this or i'm sorry i don't know i have to
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.240]   scroll down i don't know if it's available to everybody in the world or just everybody here in the
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:24.200]   hand land of the free home of the brave i got it in Canada there you go that's all i can
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.000]   it's all i can get in Canada who cares because it's it's it's it's all they should be is the
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.040]   United States or us adjacent they figure that i had to agree to take alpha flight number one is
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:39.640]   one of my picks but after i did that there there you go okay that's a comic joke right yes okay
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.680]   believe me there are a lot of john bern fans that are laughing laughing laughing
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:51.480]   somebody's already got my username who's already got my username maybe oh i signed up for this ages
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:55.720]   ago that's right i use my marvel unlimited login and actually alpha flight is one of my favorite
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:00.440]   series so i didn't mind at all okay good good classic burns and lots of lots of great stuff going
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:04.520]   started all the way from like recently relaunched series from two or three months ago
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:10.360]   all the way to you know fantastic four number one good play definitely try out superior spiderman
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:15.640]   definitely type the check out the new captain marvel absolutely check out the new hawkeye book
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.720]   these are those last two books that got launched actually all three of those books were just launched
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.320]   a few months ago and they're among my favorites uh as a matter of fact i wrote i wrote i wrote a
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:30.360]   i i've had i wrote a piece for tech hive uh that was supposed to run during the promotional period
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.400]   and then that had here a 20 number of these number one issues you should definitely have if you don't
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.640]   want to you know check out all 700 your 20 that are really really super excellent and so i think
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.400]   that that's going to be running like when those invitations start coming out so yeah i need that
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:48.200]   because i you know what i haven't read a comic since i was 11 i have no idea what to choose
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.680]   and you don't you don't just like get a batch of 700 year inbox you have to choose right
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:58.040]   you can i mean if you want a christmas tree the form and just tap tap tap you can do that
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:04.120]   okay you can do that i got on the promotion started on a sunday i logged in like maybe three
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:09.240]   hours later and as i'm like shopping saying you know what i really hate x books i've never oh god
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:14.280]   and that's like a mid like early 90s version then i realized that in the time that you're spending
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:17.880]   thinking about whether you should get this or not you should simply have said screw it by it and
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:25.320]   move on but the the the other the other pick the real pick is uh roger yerbert's memoir life itself
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:32.680]   which i've recommended at least once before as an audible pick of the week uh fantastic memoir it
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:38.760]   wasn't it's not uh this is a guy who loved to experience life who had an incredible range of
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:46.840]   adventures but it's not the story about how and then in 1977 uh susan and tawn came on to me at a
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:52.920]   party and we were making up in the back of a limo it's more like amusing on here is these here is an
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:57.400]   account my account of the seven decades i've spent on this earth and the things that i remember
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:04.120]   and the things that i've learned uh so it really is not only just a good read if it were a novel it is
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:08.840]   just a powerful piece of writing uh and there's going to be as a matter of fact a documentary about
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:14.040]   uh roger that's going to be coming out uh i don't know what's going to be coming up there's there's
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.160]   still shooting it right now produced by martin squirce as a part of it's going to be based on life
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:21.480]   itself really you really want yes they're they're shooting it in our fact during the memorial service
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:26.440]   and stuff like that the director of hoop dreams which is one of roger's favorite uh i think maybe
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:32.040]   one of roger's favorite movies of all time uh is uh directing it uh so it's going to be it's going to
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:36.600]   be something pretty special uh but again certainly one of my even if i didn't know roger this would
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:40.600]   be one of my favorite books of all time available in audio available in kindall available in old
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:45.560]   fashion paper uh but definitely don't get it i listened to the audiobook uh ed herman reads it
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:51.080]   thanks to you and your recommendation is really great highly recommend it uh rene richy your pick
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:56.520]   of the week my pick i i miscalculated my pick is only coming out later in the week so i am going
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:03.720]   to pivot and do a tip uh and i'm going to once again enlist the aid of the uh twit army so if someone
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:09.080]   or many people could twitter at mention me at rene richy one of the problems people keep complaining
[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:14.440]   about is that notifications on apple come down and they obscure things like the back button
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:20.280]   or game controls or something in an app that you really need access to and you have to wait for
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:25.960]   the push notification to show up but what you can do is and i haven't gotten one yet but you as
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:31.000]   soon as a push notification comes up you can tap it pull down a little bit and then throw it away
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.560]   so if you're leo if you're trying to update the simpsons and it's something is in your way you
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.960]   can just immediately grab the notification pull down a little bit flip and it is gone immediately
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:44.600]   and you can hit the back button you can hit the buy button you can toggle whatever control you need
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:51.640]   to do that's a nice tip i just hate having to kick this little x and the notifications to clear all
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:56.280]   i can never yeah that would be nice but this one um like if you're playing candy crunch or you're
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:00.280]   playing letter press and you just need to get to that button and i basically say no to everybody
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:05.160]   now yeah but you know i finally realized when it says would you like to allow notifications you
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:10.280]   don't have to say yes it doesn't break anything and so now i just don't allow don't allow don't
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:14.120]   allow and i wish i'd done that years ago because you can always go in and change it but it's just
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:19.960]   a pain in the butt so i should splock everything i hate to recommend another five by five host
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:25.000]   but it's since any anacos one and i'm sure in a witchy any minute now you're gonna get the call
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.760]   from dan benjamin but meanwhile till then there's a guy who does a show on five by five called teenage
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:35.640]   waistland uh you may be familiar with it dave pelle but i'm not recommending that so don't listen to
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:40.840]   his show god knows we've got enough competition we don't need to add to it but he does have an app
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:47.720]   that i think is actually really good called next draft world's worst icon but a really interesting
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:52.360]   idea and i got this from ome malak who said you know just it's a free app you just download it
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:58.760]   and uh every day you get a new like bunch of links not very many by the way there's like five
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:05.480]   links in here to interesting reads and uh sometimes they're tech but not always if you're if you're
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:12.040]   interested in just kind of some curated news i think this is kind of good dave apparently is a
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:19.160]   venture capitalist or angel investor uh don't know who he is but this is a little email newsletter
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:24.920]   that's very quick read in this case it looks like there's ten uh articles all with links
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:33.880]   it's called next draft and i think it's you know a good example of what curated news is all about
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:40.920]   despite the really ugly icon which is dave apparently that's how he looks with a plastic suit
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:46.360]   thank you everybody we do this show every tuesday 11 a.m pacific 2 p.m eastern time
