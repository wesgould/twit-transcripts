[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   where we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And finally, there is news from Apple,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   quite a bit of news.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   But just to reassure everyone,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   there is no Mac news, there is no HomePod news,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   there is only Apple iPhone, Apple TV.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   The iOS Clan.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It's the iOS Clan and the Apple Watch.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Alex Lindsay is joining me in the studio.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   He was here earlier today during the Apple event.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   We watched it live together.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   In fact, we have, if you haven't seen it,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   a video of it, you can watch our play-by-play,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Megan Moroni and Alex Lindsay and I.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Also with us, he was home watching with great interest
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   and the Enoco taking notes, writing, scribbling, scribbling,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   scribbling, scribbling, from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Hi, Andy.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Hello.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Renee, not with us because he's actually touching
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   an iPhone X right now.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   The thing is with Renee, I would understand,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I wouldn't fault him if he heard about the new watch bands
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   and said, "No, I'll check out the iPhone X at the end."
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Let me see those bands.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Look at those bands.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   That's what I'm really interested in.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Actually, let's start with the Apple Watch because Apple,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   they began actually.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Let's start with where they began,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   which is with a beautiful video, I thought,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   almost live of the outside of the Steve Jobs Theater,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   the Apple Park Campus Journalist coming in,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   but it was obviously not live because it was beautifully edited.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Everybody looked good.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It wasn't a race scratch in there, but...
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   We didn't recognize anybody.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   We didn't recognize anybody.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So who knows?
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It might have been taped three days ago.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   The only got the people with YouTube channels are camera ready.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   They didn't get the actual press.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   They didn't get the actual press.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Then they descended into the theater.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   There's nothing just to answer some of our questions that we had.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   The glass dome in the middle, there was nothing.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   There wasn't even a registration table.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I don't know where they registered.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It must have been somewhere before that.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   There seemed to be like a...
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   If you looked up, there was like a...
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Not a real constellation of stars, but they were concentric rings
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   with little spot-like white, super bright whites.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So of course, I spent much of the morning watching friends
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Instagrams of their...
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It was gorgeous.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   A little bit gorgeous.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Yeah, it does look like a...
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It's one of the least fun parts of those events
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   is the milling about time, where you're just all sort of crushed
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   into one place, and it's like...
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It's like cafeteria day at the high school where it's like,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   you don't know who you're supposed to be talking to or whatever.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It looks like there's a lot of space, a lot of air there.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So it looks like a really...
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It's going to be a fun place to hang out.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Yeah, really.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   There's those lights you were talking about on the world's largest
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   freestanding carbon fiber roof.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Just held up by the glass.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And it was completely empty.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I think the demo area is obviously downstairs.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   We were maybe deceived by labeling on the plans.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Really pretty.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Very, very apple.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Very much an apple low-power.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And that's what it...
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   The elevator, it's just...
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Nice job.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Very beautiful.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And everything about that space is hard.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Like when you look at it from a construction perspective,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   you know, all that curved and everything is registered perfectly.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I mean, it's just...
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   They're just showing off.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   First time ever on the new Apple Park with the Steve Jobs Theater,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   they began with a pre-recorded tribute to Steve Jobs in his own voice.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Quite moving and beautiful.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And quite appropriate.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Tim Cook came out and acknowledged, you know,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   this is the theater Steve built.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   It really was like consecrating a brand new cathedral that took 10,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   20, 30 years to build, where you could really see the emotion in Tim's voice.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And it really was a dedication, not just of the space,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   but of the legacy of Steve Jobs.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Essentially making it the apple mantra that one of the ways,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I think, that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands or hear their stories
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   or tell yours, but in making it, something is transmitted there.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And so a way of expressing to the rest of the species are deep appreciation.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So we need to be true to who we are and remember what's really important to us
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   and what's that, and that's what's going to keep Apple Apple.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And yeah, you saw the other line.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   There's so many lines that I really wanted to write down.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   He said, I love hearing his voice.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Steve meant so much, it means it's not a day that goes by,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   but don't think about it.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And then the line, it's taken some time, but now we can reflect on him with joy
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   instead of with sadness.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And they really did seem sometimes where he just needed a moment,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Tim needed a moment just to collect himself and move forward.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   It really was a beautiful way to, to, to, uh,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Chris and this new facility.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And I think Apple was rightly, and Tim were rightly excited about the products
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   they were about to announce.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I mean, not just a gorgeous new theater, $1.4 million per seat theater.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And, and, uh, I don't know.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   A couple of people tweeted it felt still very intimate, kind of felt like the,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   theater at one infinite loop, kind of small and intimate.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Although it holds a thousand people, only 350 journalists, I guess, in there.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   A lot of Apple people, board of directors,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Lorraine Powell, Job Steve's widow was there in the front row.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Wozniak was there with his wife, Janet.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Apparently I didn't see him, but Al Gore was there.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Johnny Ive was hiding under a baseball cap.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   So, you know, it was, it's, this was a special event for Apple,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   more than just new products.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   But, oh, and for the first time ever, Angela Arrence, the new head of Apple
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   retail, the woman hired away from Burberry came on stage wearing.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I didn't realize it.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   A Burberry coat, a pink lace Burberry coat.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   First time she's spoken, apparently she's very shy.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And what she talked about was a reinvention of Apple retail, which I thought was quite interesting.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yeah, I think that go ahead, Andy.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   No, I was going to say they really did expand the vocabulary about what they're doing with retail.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   This is the first time I think that I've heard them talk of, like,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   the town square concept where they, with, for the larger stores, for the landmark stores,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   they really are trying to create a gathering space, not just for people who need to,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   need to get their phones fixed, but for just your in the neighborhood, you need a place to meet
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   before you go to dinner, to go to the theater.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Hey, let's meet at the Apple store.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   They got Wi-Fi.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   It's pretty.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   They got places to see it set.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   They've got trees.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   The Grove, that's what they're calling the service waiting area.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   A place I wasn't aware of, that for local entrepreneurs and developers,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   they have a space they call the boardroom, which is a private place within the Apple store that they can
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   come together and collaborate.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I don't know how you reserve that place where you can get it for a kid's birthday party.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   The avenues, they call that that plane of light wood where they have those little shelves
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   with third party hardware.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   They call those the avenues.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   They're like designed to be like shop windows and change seasonally.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   It's not just for hanging out for buying stuff that we do photo walks where you walk around
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   the neighborhood led by people showing you how to take pictures with your phone, teachers'
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   day, sessions led by local artists in the bigger stores.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   They really were making a big point of rest before they would use it to say, "Oh, look
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   how big and beautiful our new store is."
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   We're doing a new one in Beijing.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   We're doing a new one right over here.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   It really is more about here is our theory of retail.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Here's why we do this sort of thing.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Really trying to create that impression of Apple as we're not just, we would love to sell
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   you a $1,000 phone, but we really are trying to, when we tear apart part of someone's downtown
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   to put a store there, we're trying to do something better than a Dunkin' Donuts.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   We're trying to create something that's going to be there for 10, 20, 30, 40 years and is
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   going to improve the neighborhood while still becoming part of it, not just dropping down
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   an Apple's place, but looking like something organically a part of it.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I was left very impressed with it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.600]   We were talking during the event, Alex, that it seemed like Apple was moving the stores
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.000]   from a retail location where you buy stuff to a place where you experience.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I think that experience has you buy more stuff too.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   You buy more stuff as a result.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   You're part of the club.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   You're part of the app.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   When you start buying Apple products in this environment, you're part of a community.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   A community that they have little community centers all over the world.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   These community centers are the best part of town.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   They have great artists.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   They have great people there to help you.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   They have places for you to learn.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   But the only way to really be part of that club or that community is to buy an Apple product.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You can come in, but you're not going to really get the most out of it.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I think it's a great model.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   When you see a lot of other retailers trying to figure out how they can pack stuff in
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   and how they can get as much in front of you, you know, Apple's approach to really making sure that they serve everybody with content, I think.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   There's the Carnegie Library in Washington, D.C. that they're repurposing to be an Apple store.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   That's a lot more space than you need for a store.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   A lot of other spaces.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   When you go to many of the spaces that I've been to Apple stores all over the world.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Whether it's Sydney or London or Paris or many of these other ones you walk in and you just go, "Wow."
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It's always like this kind of over the top approach.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Somebody wrote that they're really churches and they use much of the same vocabulary as churches do with the apps and the altar.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I think it's stretching the analogy, but I think you could say this is the Church of Apple and this is the Apple religion.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   If you want to place in every city where you can come to, you've put it as be a part of the community, I might put it as be part of the cult, be part of the Apple.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   You know, faith.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I think it's really leveraging on something that has always been there.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Apple, I mean, I think it works.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   But that's how they sell so much stuff.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   You know, Apple Watch, I would say, arguably, this is the first Apple Watch. It's truly useful.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   But they've sold plenty of them up to now on the promise of the future.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Well, and also, and I've said it a couple of times in the last show, the ecosystem, it's going to work with all the other things that I have.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And I think that that process is getting tighter and tighter and tighter between your computer, your phone, your watch, your TV, your devices in your house.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   All of those things make it, the lock-in becomes more and more intense as Apple continues to move that forward.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And I think Apple went away in the stores.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   They went away from the community for a while.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I mean, a lot of those theaters were repurposed into shelving in Santa Monica and actually in the San Francisco store before they rebuilt the new one.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   But look at malls all over the country, disappearing retail stores going away everywhere, Amazon taking over.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Because what they were selling, Apple was commodities.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Right.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   But Apple is something very different.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And I think that these are not just stores.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   This is indoctrinated.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   These are indoctrination centers.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Apple is something you can see that.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Well, it depends.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   That's a slant, obviously.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   I mean, I'm very kind.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's from a business point of view, it's really brilliant that they really are training people using positive reinforcement to say, don't buy an accessory through Amazon.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Don't buy an accessory through Best Buy.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Go right through us and buy it from us.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   So you're a capturing that sale.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Also, you are really reinforcing that here is a wonderful portal for every thing you need to do in meat space that involves an apple product.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Here's a place to go.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And it's not just here is a spot between what used to be a radio shack and what used to be a painter of light gallery store.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   But it's now shuttered.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It's no, let's go.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   It can even be an inspiration to say, let's just make a diversion to not even go to the one that's closest to us.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Let's just go into Boston.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Let's go to the one that sits right next to the park.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Let's go to the new mission.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Let's go to the new store in Chicago at Michigan Avenue that really does seem more like an amphitheater sort of thing.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   And it is an emotional connection, but they really are delivering a lot of value to people while they're doing it.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   So there's always going to be a certain cult of apples or a cult of iPhone, but you can't say, I'm very, very impressed with the fact that for a company that is retail company that is so famous for making the most money per square foot in pretty much any retail operation,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   they spend so much of that square footage on things that aren't making them any money whatsoever.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And just any big store, maybe Sears Roadblock is no longer there.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Well, what's well worth is still there is not still there, but you can still see the big magnificent building that they built in the 20s and 30s or the 40s to be their big city store to make it a pleasant place for people to come.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And that could be an enduring legacy of Apple.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   It's the American state religions capitalism. Apple's stores are its shrines.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   There's a great article I read a couple of years ago. This is an atlas obscure.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   We asked a cultural historian or Apple stores the new temples.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   They talked to Erica Robles Anderson as a professor at NYU.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And I think she makes a strong case.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   You know, she the feast of St. Jobs, you know, is today.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And if you look at, I mean, I don't want to overdrive this, but if you look at this image of Steve that was, you know, 10 feet tall, 20 feet tall behind Tim Cook on the stage as he's speaking,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   there is a certain amount of worship going on here.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   It's his context. It's everything. This isn't like Scientology.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Is this like Elrond Hubbard? This is your daily days.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Yeah, give it time.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   You're dedicating the theater that's in his name. And it's still a process.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Again, from the emotion that was in Tim's voice, this wasn't just a genuine.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   I agree.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Exactly. So I really think that they were building up to this and there was nothing that was going to knock down the importance of that relative to anything else in there.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   So I would imagine that they kind of want to keep the productive version of people's respect and admiration for Steve while knocking down the worship because the worship is counterproductive.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   The worship is the reason why people are saying if there's something that is marginally not great about a beta feature that they announced was going to be a beta feature when they launched it,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   that's kind of encourages people to say, Oh, well, you know, Steve, Steve would never have allowed that product to ship or Steve would never have shipped a phone that has these two OLED ears around a black sensor.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   So that's Steve Jobs worship as opposed to here is the here is the culture that Steve Jobs founded at Apple. And here's the culture that is still alive.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And everything you're going to hear in the next hour and a half after this is not a product of Steve's brain, but it's a product of the culture that Steve created.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   So that's not again, that's the difference between hero worship and saying you have to say that he did some great stuff and he's not being forgotten.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   I think that I think that you can definitely look at holy spaces and decide that you're going to base some architecture. I think a lot of people do that to give it kind of a feel.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   But I think that the problem that makes it not a temple, there's not I really don't believe that there's any belief system that was.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Oh, I disagree entirely. Look at no, wait a minute. Okay. No, wait a minute. There is clearly a belief system.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I mean, that's obvious that if you're in the Apple belief system, you when you and I have both been in this where you've said, I will buy whatever they announced today.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Make sure you put in order for each one. There is a definite belief system around it. And I think it's to the Apple's benefit that people believe people strongly believe that Apple is going to innovate that the next if they do a wireless charger, it'll be the best wireless charger ever.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   You still believe that in your heart of heart. No, I think that's true, but I don't think that evidence is there.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   But I don't think that no, but I don't know if if it but they're not telling me how I'm going to interact with my with my life with my kids with my wife.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   I mean, it doesn't make a religion necessarily. It's not a prescription for life.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   I think an underlined true believer in in the Apple. I have a hard time finding a real religion.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   I didn't invent the phrase cult of Mac. Oh, no, no, no, definitely not. But I think that that is as a as a former philosophy major.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I think that that's over over overstated. I always have the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially personal God or God.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   It's not that that's the traditional definition of religion. So I grant you that.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   So, but I mean, I think that Apple uses it. I mean, Star Wars was generated because, you know, George work with Joseph Campbell.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He wanted to make a universe. You know, so he, you know, how about this?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   A cult is a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I could be more cultish. Look at this. This is by the way, the angelic Angela Arons standing in front of what will be the new Fifth Avenue Apple store.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   She said the the cube will be back and it's a it's a special grove where you will go. I mean, I don't want to over over burden this metaphor, but it's hard not to see those connections.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Well, I think again, I think you always take an inspiration out of out of those the holy spaces around the world.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Don't you feel like a better person because you buy Apple products?
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   It's not important for me to be a better person is for everybody else to think I'm a better person because I just can't wait until until I find out what they think of me when I send them an animated emoji of poop.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   You know, like, like that's going to really there is there was the profane among us along with the sacred. We're going to get to that in just a second.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Let's actually take a break when we come back at the what Apple actually announced and we'll go bit by bit through it because after the retail discussion, Angela Arons doing her first stage tour for Apple.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And I think she did a very nice job for Apple. She's done a lot. I love it that she wore a Burberry coat and positioned the stores, not as stores.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   But as what's she calling town squares. She said, we don't call them stores anymore. We call them town squares. Might as well call it a cathedral.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   That's my opinion. Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.

[00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Go to it pro.tv/macbreak and show them that you saw it here. It pro.tv/macbreak and don't forget that offer code. If you want an individual subscription Macbreak 30, it's a great deal.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   I'm tempted to start with the iPhone 10, but let's start at the beginning and wonder way forward.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Seems like a very good place to start. Yeah. So they start off talking about the Apple Watch and I got to say that I think I was most excited about the Apple Watch.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I was probably even more excited about the Apple Watch than the iPhone 10 iPhone X. Whatever we're calling it now.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   I think you could make the case that this is the first really useful Apple Watch. This is kind of a breakthrough platform at this point.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I think that it was with the Watch OS 2, maybe Watch OS 3, it became better.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It's getting better and better.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   This is something that I tweeted out. The latest generation watch has a lot of really great new features, but no feature is as important to the success of a platform than the simple fact that the makers have now they have goals.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   They know what this thing is. They know who they're selling it to. They know what people are expecting from it.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And now that they're really leveraging it, it's a health watch. It's a fitness watch. It has other features as well, but it is a health watch.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   It is a fitness watch. And they open it up with a wonderful video that, remember that when they launched the watch, they're showing you video of, "Hey, look, I can open my garage door with the watch and I can actually watch video of the garage door opening."
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   We're asked today to open it up with a series of personal testimonials, a video of people reading letters that you would imagine were sent to Apple in reality, saying, "Here is how your watch has improved my life.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Here's ways that all the way from, "Hey, I can have more fun to actually go out and be active now without being so worried about being killed because I have illnesses and I have disabilities."
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And then really went into the first thing they're talking about, they just glossed over that, "Oh, well, yeah, I can do high intensity interval training and now there's a swimming and I can tap against a piece of gym equipment."
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   But they just went right into it. This is the most used heart rate monitor in the world and explaining how they intend to take advantage of that.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   So it's going to be not just launch an app and get your heart rate, but also it'll get your resting heart rate, your recovery heart rate.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   So throughout the day, it will tell you what your, if it sees that you seem to be not doing anything, it will record what your resting heart rate is and collect that data.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   It will also, if you don't seem to be moving around, but your heart rate has just shot up, it will notify you that, "Hey, there's something going on, it will also make a note of that."
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   So that that data will be captured. If there's a health crisis later on in the day or later on in the week, there will be data that your doctor can refer back to.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   And also talking about, I think that they're collecting data about heart rhythm and noticing arrhythmia when your heart is out of normal rhythm when there's an atrial fibrillation.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And so they're saying, "Well, that's going to be part of the research kit that is not a feature that you'll be able to use."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   That's what I was about to say.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   That Apple has been saying that they think that the watch has been very, very effective in at least surfacing the data about this.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   So they're also announced something they're calling the Apple Heart Study against, not a feature, but it is a study that they're doing that will notice these sort of irregularities.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   They're working with Stanford and the Food and Drug Administration to collect this data and use it to get a better map of how arrhythmia's atrial fibrillation's happened.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   It's predictable, is it an indicator of other problems?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   So it's not so much that you should be aware of that they're doing this heart study, but the fact that before they even got into the really killer features of the new hardware,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   they want to talk about this is the most popular heart rate monitor in the world.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And it seems as though they feel a responsibility to not just simply say,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   "And if we have a chart of how accurate our heart rate monitor is compared to everybody else's,"
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   No, they didn't bother with that. They're saying, "Here is what we can do with that information,"
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   to, again, linking back to how they opened up the event by saying,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   "We are in the business of improving people's lives and making the world better."
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   And you don't necessarily do that by having a $1,000 phone, but you can do it by having a watch that will say,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   "Yeah, I've been watching your heart rate over the past three weeks, and I'm not saying you should go see the doctor,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   but I'm saying that if you press this button, an ambulance will be buying about 10 minutes."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Yeah, again, not a feature that you can get right now, but maybe someday,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   they've got to get FDA approval for that.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Although we mentioned before the Alivecore Cartier from, you know,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   "Victendroacher is a Livecore," which does have FDA approval, and we'll do that,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   but you have to put your fingers on it explicitly.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And I do think that when we saw a Jim kit that they just kind of walked, they kind of went by.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Now, it only works right now, I believe, with cardio, so it's, you know, the Jim kit stuff that--
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Where you tap it against the machine? Yeah, but that's going to require specialized machines.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Right now, you go to the gym, there's some that are compatible with polar heart straps, and they will pair up.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   So, presumably, somebody's going to make a tap object.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   I think we're five years away from having-- you walk to the gym and you keep your tapping every machine,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   and all of them are tracking what you're doing, because that's--
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Jim, those are expensive equipment. Jim's don't upgrade them that often.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   We would see it in high-end gyms first, you know, because there'll be pressure from people who are--
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   It took a while. I mean, the polar straps were ubiquitous in gyms, and they all had--
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Polar monitoring became somewhat ubiquitous in gyms.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Also, people have Apple Watches have money, so that's another--
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Right. It's a convenience. I don't think that's as important as some of the other--
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   If you're really into working out, I mean, if you're--
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   It'll be nice to be able to tap it, but I could still do that with--
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Yeah, but it just keeps me track of how many reps you did and what weight, and all those things can be stuff that can be acquired automatically,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   which really makes it easier to track your workouts and figure out what you should be doing.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And what happens there is it allows AI to start being smart about, well, this is what you should be--
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Like, the next time you're working out, these are the exercises that you--
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Not right now, but if we look at three, five years down the road, imagine it watching your workout and making decisions about--
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   This is the kind of exercise you should be doing the next time to push your delt towards your wife.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   But meanwhile, you know, to--
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   In the world today-- What's they skipped over though? They skipped over was incredible.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Like, yeah, that is a glimpse into it. Maybe. Okay. When that happens, we can talk about it.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Right now, it has an altimeter, and it's-- The biggest thing is it added cellular for 70 bucks more.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   So they're going to start at 329 for the series.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   They say whether they're going to charge you for the cellular? I don't think they will.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Well, we don't know yet, but they'll charge you 70 bucks for the capability.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   It'll tie to your existing account and your existing phone number, but I think that's going to be up to T-Mobile.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   You sprint AT&T. T-Mobile won't charge.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Yeah. I don't know. I can see Apple using its influence to say that,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   "No, you're not going to charge for an extra line," even though technically it is an extra sim,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   but it's not something that they have to service, not anything they have to have to handle.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   If they're going to let these companies sell the watch through the storm,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   I'm sure they enjoy the extra traffic.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   I would expect that you'll be able to get it for no cost, but we'll see.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Don't forget this is AT&T and Verizon we're talking about.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   If they can charge you an extra 10 bucks a month, they will.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Apple is the wild card. They're the ones that can say, "No, you're not going to do that.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   You're going to just make it a regular accessory."
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Very important so that people know that you have spent the money and you have the latest greatest.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   There is a red dot on the stem to signal, "I have the new Apple watch."
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   I think it's more like a when you use this as an excuse to buy a new one
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   and give your old one to your spouse to make sure you don't leave the house with the wrong one.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   That's a good point too.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   With a cheap one.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Some question the Chairman has been saying this, and I don't see,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   although this, by the way, we should say everything except the iPhone X
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   is pre-order Friday on the 15th for delivery a week later on the 22nd,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   including these new watches.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   They don't mention 38 millimeter, and that may be how they handle the battery issue,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   because you're adding a lot of capability and they claim no reduction in battery life.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Maybe they are going to eliminate the smaller version, which will make a lot of smaller people,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   especially women, and happy.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   I'm sure they're not going to eliminate it.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   I'm sure they're going to just, at worst, make it not available in an LTE model.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I would not want them to see it in this.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   I don't know what's going on there, but it's kind of miraculous,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   given that they did all the size of the watch,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   the 42 millimeter watch did not change one bit.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   They said that the backing, the crystal on the back is now a quarter of a millimeter thicker,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   but it's like, okay, whatever.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Nonetheless, that the battery life is about the same.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   That's like, given that it's hard enough for any Android Wear watch without LTE
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   to be a normal size like that, let alone have LTE built in.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   It's like, I think this really just show off why Google seems to have put Android
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   burn the back burner.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   I think they know that they have problems in trying to build a watch like Apple has built,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   that they don't know how to solve right now, and while the market is such that people
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   haven't been convinced they need a smartwatch right now, it's just very much a lot smarter
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   for them to simply keep Android Wear current, but not really invest any money in it.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   That's going to be even harder now that we're brought to talk about the series.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   So let me just be clear, I'm somebody sent me a link.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   If you actually try to buy it, you will find a 38 millimeter available for GPS plus cellular,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   which is of course the more complicated choice.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   So they are making that available.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   In fact, there's a really nice picker on the website that lets you choose materials.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   They didn't mention stainless steel, but it looks like stainless steel is there,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   so it's aluminum stainless steel.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And of course, there's new edition watches for those wanting to spend $1,300,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   and those will come in gray as well as white now.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I have to say, I buy the cheapest one that I can get because I just know that I'm going to want to absolutely
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   be out of date.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Yeah, and so it's just not worth buying the game.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   No, you're right.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Well, but let's also point out that when the most significant things that the series one watch
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   is still available, and now they've dropped the price time to $249.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   I think that's a good one.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Which is right there with premium smart watches made by pretty much anybody else.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And so that is, I'm very, very pleased across the board.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   They didn't make a part of the presentation that is now less expensive to buy into the apple ecosystem,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   but with the iPhone, with the iPad all across this year,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   for now, if you got not a whole lot of money, you can at least compete with the middle of the range
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   in competing platforms.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And the fact that this is, again, ostensibly a device that can really improve your life
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   through fitness, and through actual just health tracking, I think it's really, it really does behoove apple
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   to make sure that there is a low cost option so that you can deliver that benefit to as many people as possible.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Actually, interestingly, the price quotes are all for the 38 millimeter version.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And if you want to get a 42 millimeter, you're going to be paying more than 250 bucks.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   You're going to be paying more than $12.99.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   You're going to be paying more than $3.50.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Well, not just a little. 50 bucks more.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   I will.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   I do find it interesting that for all the things that Apple's been doing with the watch,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   I still can't figure out why they don't let developers develop the watch faces.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   The faces.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   The faces.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   The faces.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   I'm curious, you know, with apps, they held onto it.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   I tell you, it's a nightmare on Android Wear because they do have an open ecosystem and a store for faces.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And some faces use more battery life than other faces and things like that.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   I mean, because I have to be the only reason I track it is because I just, you know, I work in production
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   and I just want a digital face with seconds.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Right.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   And for some reason, Apple has decided that is not something that fits within their...
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   I'm betting battery life.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   You have to update the screen more often with seconds, right?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   But they update it when they have the sweep.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   They have the sweep.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   They have...
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   They just for some reason will not show seconds.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   And it's just like one of those things like...
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   You will also have to have the watch match your phone's carrier.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Not only will you have to have an iPhone, you will have to have it be on the same carrier.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   So I guess that means you're going to be going to this store.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   I don't know.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I guess you'll choose the carrier.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   So by the way, it does not include things like US Cellular and some of these other carriers.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   You have to have an iPhone and you have to have an iPhone with a carrier.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   It's supported in China, China, China, UNICOM only.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   But later this year, two of the other big three carriers.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   I really hope that the fact that they now have one with LTE built in,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   with cellular built in,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   is that they're not going to have a battery.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   So you have to have an iPhone with a carrier that's supported in China, China,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   and China, China, UNICOM only.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   But later this year, two of the other big three carriers.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I really hope that the fact that they now have one with LTE built in,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   I really hope this is a step toward saying you don't even necessarily have to pair it with any phone.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   So long as you've got some sort of phone that the sim chip can either clone or just create a brand new,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   even create a brand new account with,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   the fact that this is now ostensibly a really independent device.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   It's got Wi-Fi, it's got cellular.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   It doesn't necessarily need to be paired with an iPhone.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And I keep hoping that Apple is going to one day do with this the same thing they did with the iPod
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   and what they had to do with the iPhone,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   and saying that this is not an Apple exclusive product.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   You can use this with any device you want to bring,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   because obviously we tend to think that everybody in the world who wants an Apple watch is going to have an iPhone as well.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   But that's not going to be the case.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And I think that to reach its full potential at some point,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   it has to have some sort of compatibility with Android where,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   excuse me, I'm sorry, with Android phones, and as time goes by as the watch OS gets more sophisticated,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   the technical reasons that make an iPhone an essential part of the ecosystem for the watch
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   get smaller and smaller and smaller.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   So I really hope that we're getting to a point where you can pair,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   if you've got an iPhone, it'll work great with an iPhone.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   I think it'll work with pretty much anything it'll back up to,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   it'll back up to your iCloud account, it'll back up to anything else.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   I think the challenge will be is that, if you look at the number of iPhones,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   an Apple sells the number of watches, that could be a decade from now,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   or 15 years from now, before they need to do that.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   I think it makes more sense to make it completely autonomous than it would,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   I don't think Apple would sync it with Android,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   and when we get back to religion, that's more of a religious issue,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   I think at Apple than it is.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   The blood is not, it's a little, some bad blood there.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   What more do we get, if you have, and many of us do a Series 2 Apple watch,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   is it worth the upgrade?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Because it isn't an upgrade, you buy a whole new watch.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Is it worth the cellular for you?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   For the cellular, I like some.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Also, if you don't get the cellular option, this one is waterproof,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   this one is a much faster processor, the battery life, I think,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   is going to be a longer processor.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   It'd be interesting to see, as you were pointing out,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   any challenging to get all of these new features in without reducing battery life.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   The watch is the same size, the same case.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   It'll be interesting to see when people get their hands on these.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   There wasn't a whole lot of fudge in how they described things during this keynote,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   but it might have been just my perception,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   but when they were talking about how you don't necessarily need to have a phone on you
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   to use the Apple watch, they seemed to be painting a picture more along the lines of
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   while you're going to the beach, you can leave your phone back at the beach house.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   But not all of a time.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   While you're going for a run, you can leave the phone back.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   I'm not sure if they were suggesting that if you really want to use this to have,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   if you really want to use this to have hands-free calls through your,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   through your AirPods, if you really want to use this for the stuff that you would use a phone for,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   even in a minimalist sort of sense, it might be that you will only get six or seven hours
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   if you leave the phone home all day.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   So that'll be...
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   I'm surprised. I will say, going to be...
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Just being able to go to somewhere like the beach or a concert or whatever and feel like
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   you didn't have to have your phone is just revolutionary.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   I mean, I think that's worth buying the phone and buying the one.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Well, Megan was saying that as a parent, the idea that she's reachable or as a runner,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   the idea that she can get help is huge.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   And there also the other, another new feature.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   I don't know if it's LTE exclusive,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   but they're saying for the first time Siri can talk back.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   So that's another way to not only extends the importance of Siri,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   but also extends the importance of the watch because that small screen is going to be
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   really a hardwired limitation to what you can do with that watch.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   But if you can, if you can have the watch read a text to you,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   if you can have the watch give information to you without having to scroll and tap and squeeze and twist,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   that's going to be a really big enhancement.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Anything more to say about the series three?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   I mean, this, to me, as I was watching this, I felt like the watch has come of age.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   It's a whole new level of tracking now that you have LTE for government agencies.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   They do, man.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   That's a good point.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   It's got a microphone.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   All it's missing is a camera.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   It does support Apple Music.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   No word about anybody else.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   What do you think?
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Andy, will a Spotify be supported down the road or is it going to be an Apple Music device?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   I think it's going to be an Apple Music device.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   When you talk about what a streaming app has to do, I think they're going to want to make
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.240]   sure that when you do get back to your house, to your phone, you're not going to be left
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.720]   with just 10 seconds of battery life left.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.360]   So I wouldn't be surprised if they've made it exclusive for now.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.200]   And just, I think that there are a lot of things with the watch, including custom faces
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.440]   that they're, it's okay.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.400]   They feel internally as though there are things that are important for us to solve right away,
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.120]   like, again, improving the health features, getting LTE on the thing, making sure we're
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.760]   preserving battery life and designing new bands and preserving that sort of thing.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.560]   There are other things that I don't think people are, I don't think we're losing any
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.360]   sales because you can't get custom watch faces.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.960]   And I don't think we're losing any sales because you have to use Apple Music instead
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.960]   of Spotify.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.440]   I don't think they're going to lose any sales that way.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.040]   And so while that's on the board, that's why they want to do, I don't think that's something
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.920]   that was important for them to do in 2017.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:40.520]   I do think that it shows you the strength of a huge company kind of slowly wading into
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.920]   a market where this could become, over time, a real uphill battle for Spotify when you
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.600]   have a lot of people that might move to Apple Music because they want to use it with their
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.560]   watch and say, well, maybe they'll have both of them and then maybe they'll just move
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.360]   over to Apple Music.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.000]   Yeah, why not?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.040]   I mean, doesn't Apple do that?
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.280]   I mean, isn't that kind of an Apple-y thing to do?
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.320]   Yeah, I mean, just that the ecosystem becomes hard to turn down.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:12.200]   It's especially vulnerable with something like Spotify where there's only a limited
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.600]   number of months that someone's going to want to pay 10 or 15 bucks a month to two different
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.240]   organizations for the same music library ostensibly.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.640]   And I think the only thing that's keeping a lot of people in Spotify is the question
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.040]   of how do I move my playlists from Spotify to Apple Music?
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.480]   Or all of my friends are on Spotify, not all of my friends are on Apple Music.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.560]   And I like swapping playlists with people.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.560]   Right.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.160]   All right, that's the watch.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.680]   Now we move to Apple TV 4K.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:46.800]   And by the way, we should point out, I don't think there was anything that wasn't in the
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.520]   leaks, right?
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.920]   Did we learn anything all day that we didn't already know except maybe pricing and availability?
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.320]   I think we got more detail.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.320]   We got more detail.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.320]   We got more color to it.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.400]   Certainly the Apple TV 4K was well-telegraphed before its announcement.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:06.880]   And it's pretty much what we thought it would be a 4K HDR compatible Apple TV.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.360]   Price is better than maybe some speculated.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:18.680]   The 32 gigabyte version is 179 and then 200, 199 for the 64 gigabyte version.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.440]   Before we go any farther, is there any reason to buy the 64 gigabyte?
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   Do you?
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.880]   Are people putting so many games on there or something that you need it?
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.880]   No.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   Because everything else is streaming, right?
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.680]   You don't store TV shows and movies.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.960]   You store games, that's it.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   It will.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:39.720]   The only thing that, yeah, it depends on if you start taking advantage of 4K content,
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.120]   the buffer may, you know, it might be nicer to have a larger buffer.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.560]   You know, that might be the only, you know, to have a lot, because it's a lot more.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.560]   It's not RAM.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.560]   It still needs to buffer it though.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.440]   It's not not buffering in RAM, but it still needs to hold a certain amount of that data
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.440]   there.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   32 gig should be enough.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   How big is that going to be?
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:07.240]   I do think that if you were a manufacturer that had a lot of non-HDR TVs, this along
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.080]   with some of the other pushes, I think, makes a hard HDR going forward.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.880]   4K HDR is the only way to buy a monitor.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.880]   They do support.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.720]   I was pleased to learn this.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.400]   Two of the big HDR state, the biggest two, HDR 10, which is kind of the open, widely supported
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.960]   format, but also Dolby Vision, which is something that is better.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.360]   We have a winner between the two.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.920]   I think Dolby Vision is better.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.920]   That's the one that's going to win.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.760]   I don't know if it's going to win, but it's definitely those two are going to be formats
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   that are going to get to the bottom.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.400]   And then there are, there's an IMX format.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   There's some other HDR formats.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.760]   There's a bunch of other formats that are going to have a really an uphill battle now.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:43.240]   You know, as Apple and other companies start picking winners, you know, from their perspective,
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   it gets harder and harder.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   I was disappointed.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.960]   I didn't see a new user interface in one of the reasons I don't have a lot of apps on
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.720]   my Apple TVs, because then you would just have to scroll through pages, pages of like
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.720]   guns.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.360]   I guess it has folders, but it's just not, it's not a great user interface.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:06.240]   And as some are pointing out, a little disappointing that Apple did not change the fabulous remote
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.760]   that is so widely filed.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.320]   That's, that's, that's here to stay.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.120]   I think the people who hate the remote are going to be using their phone.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.960]   I don't think they regard that as a problem that they have to solve.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.680]   There were rumors that maybe they'd put texturing or do something on that, but nothing is the
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680]   same.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   Yeah, I know.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.960]   I think they're going to do a bigger change than that if they decide that they actually
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.960]   need that.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.120]   But there's, there's some, there's some other cool stuff there.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.200]   So I don't, I don't think they necessarily had to redo the interface because I don't,
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:36.640]   I don't think that this is a, I don't think this is an apps are important on the Apple
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.400]   TV to the extent that they are on an iPhone.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:44.000]   I think that there need to be hundreds of hundreds of apps so that I can find the four
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.160]   to maybe maximum of eight apps that are, that are important to me.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:53.680]   And they also, they, they were also very, very smart and the, they, you'd think that
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.960]   the big announced would be, oh, now finally it's 4K, but they say, yes, 4K, but they really
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:04.160]   put a lot more time and effort and the demo about talking up HDR saying that, no, it's
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.680]   better pixels, not more pixels.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.360]   So they're really, that was very, very smart.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.000]   That's the thing that people are really going to, it's going to blow people away.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.680]   The first time you get an HDR capable TV, it's like the, the 4K set, it's great when you're,
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.480]   when you set it up and you're sending three feet away from it with a remote control saying,
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.920]   oh my God, it's so much detail.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.560]   But when by the time you walk back to the sofa, you've kind of forgotten all about it.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.000]   It's HDR that makes it a much more, a much more pleasant experience.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   I like it.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   I agree.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   I think that's a huge deal.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.400]   They did, they did a couple of nice things where they're saying that if you bought that
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:40.320]   4K movies are going to be the same price as HD movies and all the HD movies you've bought
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:44.440]   the content you bought through the iTunes store will be upgraded to 4K for free.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.440]   And that's huge.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.640]   I'm not suggesting that that was not a trivial conversation.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.560]   I mean, the movie, we knew these negotiations were going on in the movie industry said,
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.920]   you're going to have to charge more if you're going to sell a UHD movies.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:02.840]   And to say you've already bought, I bought, it constantly annoys me, I bought the undersea
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:09.920]   world of Steve Zisu, the Wes Anderson film, and S.D. years ago when it came out.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.320]   And it's always bugged, or maybe it was a real Tenen bombs.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.840]   It's always bugged me.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.840]   Will it be upgraded?
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.840]   I don't know.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.840]   That would be nice.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.640]   I don't think so because only the HD stuff.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   Okay.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.520]   And the, what I'm going to buy it again, I think that the leverage, that Hollywood's
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.040]   leverage is slowly waning.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.040]   I think that Apple was able to go to them and say, well, we're going to have, you know,
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.400]   Netflix is going to be 4K.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.760]   Did you see the studio that we bought and just thought of reminds you, it's really nice.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.720]   Like, you know, we don't need, we're not going to need you for much longer.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.040]   You better make this easy for us.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.520]   You know, I think that that is, that is the conversation that's starting to happen.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.400]   And they got leverage, leverage.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.760]   And it didn't need to be that way.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.280]   You know, they got put that way because people played, played hardball and they thought that
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   they'd be able to cash in.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   And now it's sliding out from under them.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   I'm thrilled.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   Especially, especially now that Disney has been making rumblings that, hey, you're not
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.880]   going to be able to get Star Wars, you're not going to be able to get the Marvel movies,
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.480]   you're not going to be able to get the Disney movies on any streaming platform, but the one
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.320]   that we want to create.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:10.480]   And you can't help but notice that every single image that was in every single screen was a
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.680]   Disney movie in some way, shape or form.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.720]   Even when they're talking about like the history of the history of color, color TV,
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   they use the image of an old fashioned TV running like a 1960s TV show.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.720]   It wasn't bewitched.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.000]   It was Disney's wonderful world of color.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.400]   So I think Apple is going to be first, first on the line to get whatever streaming service
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.400]   that is.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.800]   So that is a lot of leverage that they've got against against whatever company that they're
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.160]   trying to negotiate rights for.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.480]   So speaking of other companies, they did mention that Amazon Prime is coming still quote later
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.160]   this year unquote.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:50.960]   So maybe not next week as I was kind of hoping because I didn't realize how much content
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.360]   I've got on Amazon Prime until I started.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.520]   So I installed it on another set and said, oh, that's right.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.320]   I did buy that TV series.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   And oh, that's right.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.000]   There are these three documentaries that are only available on Prime now.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Oh, no.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.120]   I stand corrected.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:13.160]   People who have been pixel peeping the images from the event say the remote has been modified.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:18.320]   It now has a menu button and the menu button has a white circle, a lit white circle around
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:19.320]   it.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   Maybe it's not lit.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.160]   Maybe it's just white.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:25.560]   But that will very much make it easier to figure out which end is up.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:30.280]   So maybe that is that is a little bit of a response to people's complaints about that
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.280]   remote.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.880]   It'll help you to find out what end is which it's not new that menu button.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.480]   I think that is a menu button was there.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.120]   It's just the ring around it that's different.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.120]   All right.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.360]   Yeah, still doesn't help when it gets in.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.440]   When it starts changing the channel, when it's in between the seat cushions.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.480]   I can tell you I'm not in a drawer because I accidentally hit it all the time.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.160]   I will say that I have a bunch of stuff going into my TV.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.160]   So I have a harmony control hub is great.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.960]   And you have a whole new respect for that.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.680]   This is the little Apple controller when you have the harmony one because you're like click,
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   click, click.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:08.440]   Oh, you have the, you have, you need the harmony hub that does, that's either a phone app or
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.480]   your voice with Echo.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480]   That's what you need.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.600]   Go out and go high V to a store.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.600]   Yes.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.200]   Anything else to say about the Apple TV?
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:23.600]   They did mention that the TV app will have live sports and eventually live news.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.600]   Live sports.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   Three is PN.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.600]   Right.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.800]   So I think it's just about like your favorite team is a game starting stuff, also stuff
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   like if it's a close game that you're not watching, you'll say, oh, by the way, there's
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.760]   stocks Yankees game is in the 11th inning right now.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   And that's cool.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.360]   There are even three brew barbs that you want to check out.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.560]   That's that's that's that's that's the TV app, not necessarily through Apple TV.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.180]   But it may be people get, they still get, they still have to create a reason for people
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:56.580]   to do something with the TV app except for drag it into that folder.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:00.200]   Like with the stocks app and the other apps that they don't want to, they would they
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.720]   would reinstall if they could.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.620]   I do have a folder for all those apps.
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.200]   There's the I think I call it legacy apps.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:11.060]   Here's the the footnote on the Apple TV.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.640]   There's a footnote next to the live.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.240]   See it says here and streams, live sports and news, footnote one.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.660]   So let me go all the way down and read footnote one.
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.320]   Subscription may be required to add some content, live sports, subject to blackouts.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:30.020]   No, not all kind is available in 4K HDR, 4K resolution requires a 4K cable to be TV.
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.740]   Playback quality will depend on how we're in a connection available on iTunes title,
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:36.220]   availability, subject to change some applications are not available on all areas.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:39.380]   Application availability is subject to change.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:44.980]   Emperor, if DSC member, if DSC battery is not included.
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.660]   So I'm parsing that, but it sounds like you'll have to subscribe to something.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.660]   I'm fine with subscribing something.
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.940]   If I don't have to type in my stupid, you know, I'm a cord cutter.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.940]   I haven't had.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.320]   I don't have to log into XFINITY all the time for me.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.320]   I can't do that.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.240]   So I'm just like, okay, well, that doesn't exist for me.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.400]   You know, like, just like if I have to log into that, I'm like, you know, as soon as I hit
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:10.240]   that, Showtime asks me like every three weeks, I have to reactivate the Showtime anytime.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.240]   So it's really frustrating.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.240]   I got like HBO now because like it's better.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.280]   HBO now I pay my 10 bucks a month and then I'm done.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.280]   Is that all?
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.280]   I thought it was 15.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   I don't know what it is.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.640]   It's a credit card.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   It's plastic.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   It's not money.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.120]   It's not real money.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:29.760]   So the Apple TV models will, I guess they'll continue selling the non 4K Apple TV with it,
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.420]   but the new remote, the ring ring around the price on the non.
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.420]   You want to know the price?
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.420]   I'll tell you right now.
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.420]   49.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:41.620]   So 149 for the original Apple TV, 179 for the 32 gigabyte 4K and 20 cents.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.740]   For 20 bucks more you get another 32 gigs.
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.940]   Yeah, why wouldn't you?
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:47.580]   So you should just say go for 64.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:52.400]   You don't know now, but it's not like you're going to add a SIM card and put more memory
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.900]   in there.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.800]   You'll be vision HDR 10, 2160 output.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.800]   It's nice.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:03.520]   They put the iPhone 7 processor in there, the 10X Fusion chip.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.920]   Yeah, I'd like to.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:12.480]   I'm probably going to get one to test and that's there are some apps that aren't necessarily
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:17.680]   optimized well that on my first generation, excuse me, on the current generation Apple
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:24.260]   TV, it can't stream something that I've recorded directly off the air at 1080 off of my file
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.260]   server here.
[00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:29.380]   That's the one where I've got other other boxes that can stream it directly through
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.380]   Plex.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.580]   Others, it's well just it'll choke after like two or three seconds unless I transcode it
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.580]   to something else.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:38.820]   I'm wondering if that 10X processor will help me to be able to stream that thing directly.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.940]   Apple also, and I'm really puzzled.
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:47.640]   They announced the successor of the iPhone 7 and 7 plus, the 8 and the 8 plus, which
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:52.400]   are, you know, they've got glass backs so they have wireless charging now.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.800]   The camera, the wide angle camera is a little faster.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.680]   I think it's f1.8 now.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.080]   They're minor improvements to this.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.560]   Of course iOS 11 brings a lot of improvements, but they bring those to any iPhone.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:11.040]   Who's going to buy this phone with the iPhone 10 looming next September?
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.500]   Inside that have just drawn a line and they're not going to spend $9.99 on a phone.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.480]   I mean, I think they're just going to, there's some people that are just going to like,
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.480]   that's too much for a phone.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.200]   You know, I'm not going to go down that path.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:24.080]   I think that's who buys it because otherwise why would I, and some people may want, I think
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.740]   also there are people who are going to not going to want the base ID.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:28.740]   They're going to want to specially.
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.740]   Right.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.160]   Well, you still have such ID.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:38.540]   You also will get besides the new processor, presumably new augmented reality capabilities
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:41.000]   because of the new processor.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   Not really.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.120]   I don't think the iPhone 8 really has a lot of, and to be honest with you, I don't think
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.120]   the iPhone 10 does either.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:51.000]   I don't think it has other than being able to animate people's faces.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.200]   It doesn't have an outwardly pointing depth sensor.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.240]   So it's not really, it's only one face.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.240]   You can go like recognition.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.440]   Yeah, you're not going to get the tango like, you know, quantization of the world around
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.440]   you.
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:03.440]   Right.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.640]   But also don't they both have the same A11 bionic chip?
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.120]   A11 bionic, maybe.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.840]   I think that it would be the same.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   Faster chip.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.840]   Right.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.680]   The same onboard neural network.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.720]   Also, true tone display in the in the eight.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.560]   I decided we're going to get rid of all of our color accurate monitors and just put
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.560]   the iPhone.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.280]   True tone adjusts for ambient light, right?
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   Is it more accurate though?
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.640]   Is it DC IP three?
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   Is it?
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.640]   I don't know.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.640]   We don't know.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.640]   I think it.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   Are they still saying?
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:35.360]   I seem to remember the point I was talking to them about it when they first did it, that
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:39.280]   they weren't willing to say that it was a standard, but they're willing to say why?
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.400]   As if they engineered it to meet that standard, but it was not certified for that standard
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   for whatever reason.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:49.280]   Well, the reason I ask, at least and I both have iPhone seven pluses, I was just talking
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   to Lisa.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.480]   She says, I don't I think I'm not going to get the eight.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.160]   I'm going to wait for the 10.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.800]   I'm wondering how many people are going to do that.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:04.480]   I got to say that I wasn't terribly there was nothing about the iPhone X that made me
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   think, my God, this is a game changer.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.920]   I think you weren't roll over.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   Let's not.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.920]   I want to save the X.
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:12.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:18.520]   No, no, I'm saying compared compared to the iPhone eight, I'm saying that the I see a bigger
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.240]   improvement between the iPhone seven and the iPhone eight between the iPhone eight and
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.920]   the iPhone 10.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.680]   So I mean, it's it's it's it's not necessarily the money.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:33.080]   It's just that and we'll talk about this when we go to the iPhone 10, but it really didn't
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:38.760]   seem like they certainly built this up about I think the line they used to introduce this
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:44.880]   was that there's a again, this iPhone 10 stuff, but they really set it up as we're want we're
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:49.080]   in a revolutionized phones as much with this as we did with the original iPhone.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.960]   And I see a very well made very beautiful phone.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:57.440]   I see what I was sort of anticipating a few months ago before the major leaks hit, which
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:02.480]   is that they're going to make a very, very beautiful product that aesthetically it's it's
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.520]   going to be beautiful to hold in your hands can be beautiful to look at.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.880]   It's not going to it doesn't seem like something that is going to change the way that I use
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.880]   a phone.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.800]   However, so I'm I really think that it's going to be an interesting question to see who's
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   going to spend the extra two to $300 to get the iPhone 10 over the iPhone eight because
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.880]   for people who are still using what's an iPhone six or an iPhone five who buy phones
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.080]   let's say every two or three years, I don't know what I would tell that person if they're
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:32.520]   asking me should I buy the iPhone eight or the iPhone 10 I think that I would say buy
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:38.640]   the iPhone eight unless a you have you hold the new one in your head the tenant your hand
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:44.080]   and it's so gorgeous you got to have it because again it's nice to have nice things in life.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:48.320]   I don't think that it's people are going to be disappointed that unless unless their
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.400]   job involves them requires them to wear gloves and they have to keep taking them off reduce
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.440]   touch ID to unlock their phones.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:58.240]   I don't think that this is anything that's going to really change the way they use phones.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.120]   So that's just my opinion.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:04.680]   So Apple will be offering and I mentioned during our live stream this is kind of like
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:13.520]   late day iPod SKUs they'll be offering probably the largest number of iPhone SKUs ever's they're
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.920]   going to keep at least apparently according to the webpage in this keynote they're going
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:22.240]   to keep the SE as at three twenty nine the low price leader they're going to keep this
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:29.040]   surprised me a little bit the six S and six S plus they're going to those are the ones
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.240]   those three have a headphone jack.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:35.760]   So that's for the people who need headphone jacks they're going to keep this really strange
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:40.360]   to me that they're going to keep the seven and the seven plus because those are so close
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:46.240]   to the eight and eight plus but they're going to have the eight and fusion chip and then
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:53.000]   you can go to the eight and the eight plus with the eleven bionic chip or and we'll talk
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.800]   about the iPhone 10 a little bit later so that is that is three six eight models and
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:04.120]   within those eight models you know lots of colors lots of this is a this is very much
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:10.840]   like the late days of the iPod we had you wide I think I rarely say this go ahead I
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:16.120]   rarely say this but I would say that you know this is not something Steve would do.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.560]   Yeah you know like when you look at this like this is the same as Lee that's the first
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.520]   thing he did when it came back to apples the cut all the skew I think the problem this
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.320]   is creating is exactly what the advantage that Apple had for a long time which was that
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.440]   I don't have to make a lot of choices over this I remember the the mid 90s when Apple
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:36.400]   had so many versions of a Mac that were that I I couldn't understand which one I want to
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.840]   buy my parents when I ended up not buying one because I couldn't understand like I
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:42.080]   goes like oh this one's got a CD rom and this one's got this other thing and this one's
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:46.000]   got another thing and and I think that there's I think there's too many notes you know I think
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:52.160]   I think I think this is an indication that they're seeing a lot of data from the Android
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:56.960]   side of things I love the fact that you can the minimum buy in for an iPhone is now 350
[00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.080]   bucks I think that's wonderful I think that they're covering every single price point
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:08.200]   that's out there now they have price competitiveness with the complete Android lineup there except
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.440]   for the really really inexpensive ones but I don't think that they have the capable even
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:17.280]   the capability of doing a $200 iPhone the way they want to make one but we're we're in
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.000]   a world right now where a really really good Android phone costs three to four hundred
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.920]   dollars not six to nine hundred dollars and I think that reflects that it also reflects
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.880]   the fact that they're selling iPhones all over the world not just in the United States
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:34.040]   of America and we're asked we tend not it seems as though the market here will bear six to
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.640]   seven seven to eight hundred even a thousand dollars for a phone there are parts of the
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:44.800]   world where six hundred dollars is the less just screw the kids education let's just let's
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.400]   just let's just have a blowout and spend five or six hundred bucks on the phone and it's
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.800]   also I think a point that there are going to be places where markets where you have to
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.680]   have a headphone jack you can't get by with having a phone that does not have a headphone
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.800]   jack so I would be surprised if there were this many these many models this time next
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:06.120]   year but I think they're going to collect a lot of data over the next year about which
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.800]   of these phones sell where they sell and what features people buy them in and then we're
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.880]   going to see you a few models drop off the price list but I think that part of this
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:21.960]   is just Apple not only innovates in hardware by stuff we're going to be talking about with
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.040]   the iPhone 10 but also the innovate and as they keep building more copies of this they
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.160]   figure out how to make them less expensive without changing the component count and if
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.920]   you can suddenly if you have your five hundred dollar phone or six hundred dollar phone that
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.560]   you can now sell for four hundred bucks that's almost as good as creating a brand new product
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.640]   so I think this is good news again it really does address what has been my long standing
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.240]   gripe about Apple which is that you don't want their the the the the subhead of their
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.800]   slogan to be go be poor someplace else we don't care and they seem to be addressing
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.480]   that really across the board here except for with Max and I would expect the six and seven
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.520]   to go away next year I think that the six and seven go away next year the eight will go
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.720]   to a nine and then the nine will be the last one in that series you know I wonder once
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:13.680]   people get used to a bezel this display if the displays with these ears are going to
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:20.520]   start to feel very old fashioned and sooner than maybe apple would acknowledge I don't
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:26.360]   know I mean I look at people with an se thinking what are you holding small I think I think
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.560]   the bezel is the best is it's it's it's a text into what we're talking about earlier
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.640]   about the stores it's if you buy something if they're you buy something the apple store
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.800]   online you can tell yourself that you know I see these two the the ten and the and the
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.920]   eight and you know what I think that I can just I think the eight is big enough for me
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:46.760]   I think I'll just buy that one if you go into the store and you hold that edge to edge display
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:53.400]   it really is so cool to have a screen of that size and advice is not bigger than what you're
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.400]   used to and also the presence of it in your hand that's that's one of the reasons why apple
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:03.240]   wants you to come into a store because you can't be that the psycho toxins they that they coat
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.640]   every single one of those phones with that makes you think what what what what what what
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:12.440]   what does not work through the IP addresses yeah I do think it's interesting when you look
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.160]   at these phones next to each other how much smaller the the the 10 is from the eight you know like
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.800]   it you know without you take all that stuff away and you end up with a smaller phone or
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.920]   a more usable phone in a lot of ways yeah it really is a big difference
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:32.520]   incidentally p3 displays on the eight eight plus and x so that is yeah that's what
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:38.680]   wider color gamut mums is p3 that's a that's a video standard though isn't it Alex DCI it is
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:44.520]   yeah yeah digital cinema initiative or something like that but it is a it is the color gamut of
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:50.440]   them of the mac and tosses and it is apparently the desirable color gamut for at least for video
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:58.360]   editors and perhaps for photo editors although I think Adobe sRGB or yeah there's so many
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.200]   as well I don't know I mean you just you kind of open it up and you have to use like oh yeah
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:10.440]   this is accurate I don't care all right let's take a break and we will get to the juicy part we'll
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:16.040]   pull out the plumb the iPhone 10 which I did not think it was going to be called the iPhone 10 I'm
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.560]   shocked shocked I tell you I thought it was going to be the X I thought it'd be the pro
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.120]   I'm just I don't know why they would well we'll talk about I feel I feel like I should
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.560]   have I feel like I should have predicted the X that seems like the only thing that could have
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:33.240]   called it at this point really because it's 10 the 10th and it's so natural also it's it gets
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.200]   the job done of not being a number so they can keep now they can say we have the iPhone X
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:44.520]   2017 the iPhone X 2018 the iPhone X 2019 without having to keep increasing the number and tell
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:49.960]   he said it's 10 not X so they're gonna have to call it the 10 2018 and the 10 oh 29 he's just a
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:59.400]   Latin scholar and he has to read his life I want the m m c d l x i i iPhone

[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:22.360]   think we can sing happy birthday although I was the other day I was in a chevies and they still
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:26.520]   sang that silly song that they sing oh yeah because they don't want to pay for happy birthday I think
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:32.920]   that is now part of the manual yeah that's hard can we change that I know it's the part of the manual
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:40.600]   it's in the manual we got the video we got VHA's tapes in every single store right iPhone 8 5.8 inch
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:45.880]   display the biggest display apples ever offered the first time apples ever done an OLED display
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:52.760]   it is bezel lists there is no lip at the bottom no shoulder at the top but there is a rother
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:58.760]   why iPhone 8 or iPhone 10 did I say 10 these are eight see this is why it should have been the
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:05.400]   iPhone pro i'm just saying hey groobers group do you read groob about that leak somebody somebody
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:12.360]   an apple employee it's believed gave out the super secret URLs of the soon sold master apple
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.000]   and probably and probably excommunicated from the country and of the gold master of iOS 11
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.040]   apparently that had all the information including the names of the phones and apple says the worst
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.880]   leak in our history is terrible you know mg seagler wrote a good piece on medium saying look it's
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.680]   the job of the press to report this there's a lot of interest from everybody from potential
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:38.520]   purchasers to financial markets you can't expect the press to do the job of the PR and you know
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:44.200]   not say a word that employee will probably be fired if they can figure out who it is and I
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:49.960]   have no doubt that they can figure out I thought I thought it was a honey pot right I thought oh
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:54.760]   no no that's not the real numbers they put that out so that whoever released it now is but no it
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:10:04.120]   wasn't it wasn't there's mg's column how do you like them apples so it is the 10 it's an x but it's
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:11.400]   Tim said 10 just like but see they dropped the 10 from Mac OS right it's a final cut pro 10 is 10
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:17.640]   is it still 10 okay and I personally thought well they've got pros for every other product in the
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:23.160]   line the Mac Pro the iMac Pro the MacBook Pro the iPad Pro why don't they have an iPhone Pro it seems
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:28.440]   but maybe they don't want to imply pro maybe they just in fact in a way x implies like the
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:37.640]   x factor or like uh you know like google's x you know uh rnd division it's kind of the future phone
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:44.120]   so maybe that's yeah or the Tesla x Tesla it's good it's it's you you easily when you when you call
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:49.000]   something like the iMac Pro or the MacBook Pro people kind of know what you're talking about
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.320]   you're talking about hey it's got kickass CPU and this is kind of have more expandability
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:11:01.000]   what does a pro phone mean you know so it's it's i mean it's not important but i i feel as though
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.120]   yeah i feel as though if i give it more thought i know i i know i didn't give it more thought i
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.200]   felt as though that said that would have been a very very good bet to have made um x you mean
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.920]   but ten ten x i you know you've got me i've actually made a note to
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:21.000]   to the emails and i'm sending people i know at apple saying is it the x or is it the ten well
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.080]   that's one of the reasons i didn't think they would name it that because for years people have
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.800]   called it mac OS x when it's clearly OS t i think well i think it's always well just like mac OS x
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:35.560]   it's never remember that they didn't call the mac OS x i you know when they when they when they
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:43.000]   went to mac OS 11 uh they still mac OS x well actually actually they it was always mac OS 10
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.560]   they changed they changed it to mac OS nothing right now it's nothing that's true but there was
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.360]   always mac OS 10 it was always wrong to call it mac OS x uh i would like to find our heads they've
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:12:00.360]   won but tim i listened he said uh iphone 10 it is the 10th anniversary iphone so it makes sense in that
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:07.000]   respect but i agree i agree Andy that the the letter x even if it's not pronounced that way
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.240]   does reflect better on what this phone really is and i have the experimental the extreme the
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:18.760]   future phone i also think that that will iphone 8 or iphone 9 will be the last one in that series
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:24.120]   so i think that that's the you know the i think you'll get one more that looks like the iphone 8
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.920]   before the iphone 10 is this kind of and i think what's interesting about what apple did there is
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:33.720]   that you know like a lot of us got upset i still have my old macbook pro because i don't want to
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:39.160]   give a bite they they jumped pretty far ahead with the macbook pro and there's a lot of people
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:44.200]   that resisted that whereas if they if the if the iphone 10 was the only thing they had released i
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.680]   think it would have been there would have been a lot of blowback i think they're gonna want to do
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:51.880]   that one more time and then i think that that and then i but i think that the form factor that
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:57.240]   you see with the iphone 8 will have one more that kind of ties that that group together and the iphone
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:02.200]   10 then represents everything for the next decade no blush gold just silver and black
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:09.640]   no rose gold the rumors had a third color but we also heard from minkchi quote in the wall street
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.920]   journal they were having a lot of difficulty making this fact minkchi quote says they can only do
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.920]   about 10,000 a day which means this will be in very short supply in fact all of them all over the
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.360]   game went all over the game went all over the end of october and won't arrive till the beginning
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:26.840]   of november so you can't even get one next week right everything else we mentioned so far
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.880]   you can order this friday september 19 and obviously i doubt that was the plan i think it's just the
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:37.000]   manufacturer is so complicated yeah you also i i still wonder how much of that is just due to the
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.400]   reject rate on the screen for instance right you have this weird kind of cut that screen really
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.840]   because i feel like these OLED screens have been made for so long they're not making them they're
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:50.120]   buying them from samson and lg and they're well known these are not this is not new technology by
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:54.360]   any means i think that i think sensors the calibration i think there's a lot of right there's well
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:59.080]   the wall street journal said they're a month off because they tried to put a fingerprint reader in
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:04.360]   and it failed right and so that just put them back a month that's all nothing nothing more
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.600]   complicated than that i don't know i mean where where would they put a fingerprint reader on it if
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.080]   they were committed to that full-size screen you're limited just putting in the back under the screen
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.320]   that under the screen that was the that was the technology they wanted to implement there are
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:22.360]   patents for such technologies not apples okay and apparent and the story from the wall street
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:30.120]   journal is they tried and tried and ended up scrapping it and that set them back a month in the production
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.640]   cycle i don't i don't know it depends on it depends on what their timeline was for having to lock down
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:41.160]   that decision because i really doubt that they would have done face id plus touch id in the same
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:47.240]   device especially given that they were made the point that that this is uh there's a in terms of
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:53.240]   chances of accuracy of having someone who is not you unlocking this phone with biometrics by face
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.120]   id is one in one million and they put it at one in fifty thousand uh for touch id it really does
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:02.600]   seem as though they were moving towards touch id excuse me face id as a replacement for touch id
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:08.440]   all along i guess when we'll we'll we'll find out a lot when uh when i fix it does their tear down
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.160]   because there are times where you take you do a tear down of a phone and you say isn't that interesting
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:18.040]   that they decided to route this car this wiring harness this way it's almost as if there was room
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:22.520]   for something that they didn't put in at the last minute uh yeah you're right that would be the
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.960]   i mean i i'm sure i'm sure that i'm sure they have their sources i'm sure that the wall street
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:31.400]   journal is sure i'm just i'm just putting in the context of i don't understand how they could how
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:38.680]   a touch id underneath the screen could have proceeded that far and resulted in a iphone 10 that we saw
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:44.200]   that's been delayed for a month as opposed to something that was delayed until january or something
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.920]   that or something that doesn't have face id and it's not merely the delay because the other question is
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:54.280]   is it is mingsheet core right they can only make ten thousand a day because that's only three
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.520]   hundred thousand what is no three million a month is what is ten thousand times thirty yeah
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:04.760]   uh and so three million a month is not three hundred thousand a month so that's not coming
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.680]   anywhere near to what the demand would be for this phone right and i think that might be the reason
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:14.360]   people buy the eight is because they can't get the ends yeah you know i think the ten could be i mean
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:19.080]   i'm gonna call it the x just to drive apple crazy and they can be happy but you're looking at only
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.320]   three or four million capacity right now i mean obviously they could increase the capacity but if
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:28.520]   they if they can only make three hundred thousand a month well but that's see but that's also even
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.160]   in a year even in five years you don't make it enough to well that's where they're at now
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.720]   this is this is again so it could definitely just we just finished talking about how there
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:43.880]   have never been more models of iPhone in the price list ever so that in itself can be a way of
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.560]   addressing here's hot here's here's how we're going to address shortages by making sure that
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:52.440]   people who don't necessarily want an iPhone 8 but they have to buy it because we don't have the
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.760]   iPhone 7 still in the price list they can still buy an iPhone 7 i really think they are going to
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.960]   still be walking people towards the iPhone 8 as the default purchase uh and we're also assuming that
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:08.280]   if they had the ability that they can think about all the different pieces of hardware that are now
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:13.080]   new pieces of hardware that are on the iPhone iPhone X that you have to have this new IR
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:18.040]   IR emitter you have this new uh aluminum you have this new dot projector you have to have this new
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.800]   all this stuff that has to be in there these are all components have to be sourced and that have
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.440]   to work and so it's very possible that they just simply cannot get enough of these projectors or
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:31.960]   enough of these whatever it is uh to meet that kind of demand and especially for something that cost
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:38.600]   a thousand dollars at the at the minimum buy-in that's perfectly okay by apple if people who
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:43.240]   everyone who they they're still probably enough profit in there that they'll still get their money
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:48.600]   back and then some uh as well as elevating the prestige of the entire iPhone line this one the
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:55.640]   reality if you get even in the limit if let's say they limit it to two two iPhones uh for the first
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:01.400]   six months you'll probably able to buy two and sell one for twice as much as the retail value and
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:05.720]   and and and have a free phone uh you know that's I mean I think that that's gonna because I
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:10.600]   so what about face recognition how uh what do you think guys think about that does it is it
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:15.160]   kind of what we thought it would be is it going to be effective and secure are you uh
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:20.520]   accepting apples promise that it's only one in one million people that unlock your phone I
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.040]   know especially all the time yeah they did they did they did a lot they they touched a lot of
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:31.800]   really good bases there things as simple as it does not work if your eyes are not open it does not
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.600]   work if you're not looking directly at the phone so that means that the stuff that I was
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.040]   worried about a few weeks ago which is what if you're at at uh customs and border control and the
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:46.280]   agents will simply picks up your phone off the desk and simply thrust it into your face and then
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.880]   then they've unlocked your phone and they can do what are friends friends if they want on it
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:54.040]   that your kid is not going to be able to unlock your phone while you're napping on the couch to buy
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:19:01.640]   games uh they it's uh it's a does a dot projection and so it has it has to be a 3d object it doesn't
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:07.960]   look like it necessarily has to be a living 3d object because they uh had at least one part of
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.280]   the uh part of that act was showing how they got yeah how they made these really photorealistic
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.080]   masks so they're not necessarily looking for this thing to be throwing off heat well i know they have
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:23.160]   an infrared camera there so they could they make sense yeah there's an infrared camera there
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.640]   we've seen devices that do that uh in fact i think windows hello does that there's an
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.880]   infrared system on the on it so that it should be able to know whether it's whether it's warm or
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:37.240]   not yeah well they remember that the it's that's there because the the dot projection has to be
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:42.120]   invisible to the naked eye so if you if it were sensitive if it were super super sensitive
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.360]   it has to be always has to be make sure that the dot pattern is much much brighter than whatever
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:50.920]   the heat level of the person's skin is i'm not i'm not saying this is that it would be even practical
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:55.400]   for somebody to try to create a 3d mask of somebody to unlock their phone i'm just saying it's
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:00.360]   interesting just it would be interesting to see how far they went into it but they did they also
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:05.800]   made the point that if uh the things that will increase uh false positives are if you have an
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:10.840]   identical twin they did have these Spock and Mira Mira universe Spock uh and also implying that
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:16.760]   family members with a very close facial recognition facial uh similarity uh this is why a strong
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:23.560]   password is always is always a good idea but it did it all in all all it did it did leave me it
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:29.480]   oh i'm sorry a couple other data points uh that uh 30 000 infrared dots are used to
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:34.280]   decorate the map uh uses multiple neural networks for face ID that are on the device so it's not
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:41.320]   saying it's not sending your face map elsewhere uh also it's storing your face ID map inside
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:47.640]   inside the uh secure enclave just like with touch ID so all the things that made touch ID
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:54.680]   secure and trustworthy uh will also work with this so i'm i'm given that they given that they said
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:59.320]   that pair this with a really good password it's not a replacement it's for passwords it's just
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:04.120]   replacing for touch ID and i'm pretty happy with uh what what they said today and i also believe
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:10.520]   with iOS 11 you are able to tap it five times one of the buttons and it will actually go to lock
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:14.680]   it'll lock it to a you can't use the police button yeah yeah so you can you can just sit there and
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:21.560]   line and and tap it and you would uh be able to force someone to get the code from you which is the
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:26.200]   you know kind of the security angle they also they also added something by the way uh i think
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:32.200]   this came up from the uh from the o s leak from last week uh they also added something so that you
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:38.120]   you can no longer simply when you plug it in a usb on a on a mac or pc
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:43.640]   whereas it just simply said oh i'll unlock that phone uh or uh the phone is locked uh we can't
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:50.120]   access until you unlock the phone now they've actually made it so that uh it's it will it will
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:56.760]   require new biometric on excuse me it will require a password unlock not a fast and casual unlock
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:03.400]   uh to get in there so that i think something to do with having it expire uh some i some temporary
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:09.160]   id very quickly but it was designed specifically to foil law enforcement and people doing forensics
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.560]   to say that just if you if you get if you get this person's phone they've unlocked it recently
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:18.520]   and it's and you take it into the back room the fact that you've now plugged it into usb means that
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.640]   it no longer trusts you it will require an uh a new authentication before it will mount uh on the
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:27.960]   it will mount on the desktop and be visible to desktop apps so it's just this is for everything
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:34.440]   this running uh ios 11 so it just makes everything very much more secure apple does uh how now support
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:39.400]   chi charging both in the aa plus in the uh okay can i can mention one more thing uh they also
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.240]   mentioned specifically that it works with glasses you can take your book what you got like that it
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:48.200]   learns always hats you the face idea if you got a hat on you had off if you grow a beard that's
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:52.520]   no problem with that's a big deal because windows hello does not recognize me even if i just put my
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.960]   glasses on no it talks that's a big deal it talks about being able to do that while you're
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:59.880]   while you're uh it's constantly doing it while you're changing what i'm curious about is if you put
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.880]   your phone down and came back three weeks three weeks later and didn't say whether it would that's
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:09.240]   too much of a change over a period of time i'll test that well if if you put it if you put it down
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.080]   three and came back three weeks later it would ask for your password anyway right so right that's true
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:21.480]   uh apple's not above a little fud a little misrepresentation a little exaggeration for
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:28.680]   instance battery life on the iphone 10 they said well and we do all this and we get two hours better
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:35.880]   battery life than the iphone seven but note that the iphone seven's battery life was not nearly as
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.200]   good as the seven pluses and they don't compare it the seven plus and that's because even though
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:46.360]   as big a phone is a seven plus it does not have the seven pluses battery life talk time's the same
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:51.960]   but internet use is an hour shorter video playback an hour shorter and this is according to apple's
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:57.880]   own numbers so it's somewhere in between i would guess the seven and the seven plus
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:03.000]   yeah but just to that because the seven plus is fabulous but the seven's less it's probably do
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.960]   that OLED screen it just it will lead up a lot of uh a lot of uh battery and all the other stuff going
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:15.560]   on i mean you got it yeah uh not to mention this new a11 bionic which includes artificial
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:21.640]   intelligence processing isp an isp processor which all the phones will have someday
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:26.840]   yeah i'd also think they this is the first they said this was the first phone which they created
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:31.880]   their own gpu uh which is going to be a bigger and bigger deal as time goes by because remember
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:37.320]   the gpu is not just about gaming it's also it's also the artificial intelligence chip
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.880]   you know they put the uh the company that makes their gpu's out of business uh when they announced
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:46.760]   that they were no longer going to use their services right uh that company basically had a
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:50.760]   shutter because it was his their biggest uh company you know biggest customer with the danger of having
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:56.760]   one big client yeah uh but apple has more than a thousand processor design engineers and they
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:02.760]   have the capability absolutely of of doing this they they of course start with the arm design but
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.200]   then they add to it and change it and modify and the advantage and i think we're going to see apple
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.600]   continue to slowly pull a lot of these manufacturing back in not all of it but i think that there is
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:15.560]   a lot of advantages from from a private you know security perspective but mostly in interaction
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:19.800]   when you're the more you're controlling of the hardware and the software the more you can get
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:23.000]   these all the kind of work together much more efficiently and i think that we're going to see
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.400]   them do a lot more in that area camera is very impressive in the iphone uh 10 some of the features
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:36.680]   don't show up in the iphone eight nape plus as well but this is a uh extremely capable uh camera
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:43.240]   um the relighting looks pretty nifty i really love that now is that in the eight or not it is
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:49.720]   it is okay so this is the ability to but only i think the won't be as good in the eight i believe
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:55.160]   the eight is only in the rear facing camera not in the you know not right so the front camera will do
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:03.000]   it on the 10 right so the idea is that you can go through it's it's it's not portrait mode but it's
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.560]   it's another it's a lighting what do they call it the portrait light portrait lighting mode yeah
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:12.520]   which allows you to change the lighting in real time of the person you're taking pictures of
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:18.120]   to the point of eliminating the background entirely yeah the stage so i would call it so
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:23.240]   on the iphone eight able to use the dual cameras to do depth perception and then also use machine
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.760]   learning to identify what the human face is and not just simply do like a burn and dodge but also
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.880]   figure out anticipate what the contours of the face would there would therefore be and so give
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.120]   you sort of the effect of i've got a really dramatic key light and i've got the the background
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:43.000]   fading into black and we'll show you that sort of stuff live and it's also adjustable whereas if
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.760]   you've got the iphone 10 which which will act which actually the front facing camera actually can do
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.280]   3d mapping a sense you would assume that would do a much better job there but just like the
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:59.400]   original portrait mode they're releasing it in beta mode so you can assume that whoever reviews
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:04.200]   this feature and says that it's not doesn't work very well that's they have they're not thinking
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.920]   very hard because it'll it'll be oh it'll be very good i think when it gets released and then after
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:16.440]   six months time it will be as good as what portrait mode looks like right now but there's a also
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:20.920]   it's so they're also it also shows that it really is about computational photography
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.160]   more than anything else they didn't they didn't spend as much time talking about the changes they
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.880]   said that we that on the iphone even they're using a brand new sensor but they used to say
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.520]   here's how the here's how it exploded diagram of how our sensor works here's an exploded diagram
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:40.200]   of how our lenses work whereas they were have their content to simply say that we've got
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:49.080]   brand new sensors still still 12 megapixels still of one point scrolling here still 1.8
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:56.120]   and 2.8 sensors they said that it'll let in the sensors better it's larger and faster we'll let
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:00.840]   in 83 percent more light it's more power efficient deeper pixels a new color filter
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:07.320]   wider dynamic range and lower noise there you go so it's 1.8 aperture as just like on the
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:14.440]   iphone 7 1.8 aperture in the normal lens 2.8 on the on the telephoto lens optical image sensor
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:20.600]   image stabilization only on the normal lens not on the zoom one however on the iphone 10 you've got
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.640]   OAS on both of those things so when you're using the zoom mode you will still get that stabilization
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:32.360]   you won't have to go to it won't have to go to a higher level of noise in order to make it
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:37.960]   light sensitive it just it they also they also made a change so that on the iphone 10
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.920]   iphone x i should be consistent 2.4 aperture in the telephoto so it's a little bit faster
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:50.360]   better true tone flat flash on that thing so it looks it doesn't look a note that i made is
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:55.240]   when i was thinking about this it really does seem like there is a bigger improvement between
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:00.440]   the iphone 7 and the iphone 8 then between the iphone 8 and the iphone 10 so if you're expecting
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:03.640]   that this was going for an extra two or three hundred bucks you're going to get this the most
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:10.520]   kick butt camera ever made ever made it looks like it'll be better but won't be i don't think that
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:15.640]   for my money it would not be the reason to get the iphone 10 to get a better camera no i i think
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.760]   that they're going to sell as many as they can make over the next year oh yeah no i think that that's
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.720]   i mean like that i think that for the i i i do think that you know they're only limit to how
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:28.440]   many iphone 10s they're going to sell is is how many can come out of the factory i think we'll see
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:32.600]   them backed up probably almost until next summer i think that the it's going to be like the air
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.520]   pots actually the air pots have been backed up for almost a year now yeah and i think that
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:39.880]   because they're truly doing things that are really hard doing all of the stuff and making
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:44.280]   it all actually work and i think that when we start seeing what i was really one of the more
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.640]   one of the things i was more excited about than almost anything else was the scene that snapchat
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:55.080]   was able to use the the depth sensor so that means that there's a third part of the API that
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:30:01.480]   the 3D map that is massive because what you can do with that you know with the ability to scan the
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.720]   face and track the face huge is going to be massive i i do think that you're going to see
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:12.440]   um you know small lum and pop or even medium sized companies doing animations for you know
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:18.360]   literally facial animation is really really hard to do really well and that was some great
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:22.840]   facial animation that there are a point of those emojis yeah being able to do let's say motion
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:28.440]   capture with or or some animation but being able to have actual an actual facial capture
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:31.160]   i think you're going to see that on youtube videos i think you know people are going to
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:34.600]   someone's going to put that out where you can put and and when you think about combining all
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:41.400]   of these things the AR the you know imagine being able to scan your face and imagine that emoji
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:46.280]   being your face so right now they're just showing emojis what we haven't seen is the next step
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:50.920]   which is that that things already getting color and data information about your face there's no
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:55.240]   reason why it couldn't build an emoji that was your head and then when you talk it would if you
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:58.040]   little you know i think that they stayed away from that in this presentation but when you talk
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.560]   yeah talks you're talking you know i think imagine doing that or this to this show where
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:06.520]   we're all a bunch of voting heads i think i think that'd be kind of creepy i think i think that
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:10.920]   it would be great snapchat proof that they don't they don't want to see Alex Lindy's
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:16.040]   Lindsey's like animated 3d face they want to see Alex Lindy's real face but vomiting rainbows
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:23.240]   you know that's but yeah but that's that i had the same sort of reaction especially if they had a
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:29.640]   new version of iMovie where i want to add in a character and to to to be the concierge should
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:34.040]   be it i want to create an animated character and i want to give it dialogue and i can do this by
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:39.320]   simply recording what it needs to say just by holding up the phone and then it will simply
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:43.880]   create this drop in this character there but what i what i wanted to know though was this is
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:49.640]   another thing i got to ask my people at apple is that what does the when you open it up to developers
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:55.720]   do they have the ability are you giving them the ability to simply use that same camera to build
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:01.080]   its own face map or are you giving it access to the map that the phone has already built
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:07.800]   through the secure enclave but without telling it is it an api that's that so that tells the developer
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:11.560]   you don't need to know what the face map is just tell us what needs to be laid over it and we will
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:15.960]   do that for you about while hiding that data from the from the developer yeah and i there'll be
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:19.480]   interesting because i don't want to get needs to know i don't think it needs to give you all of
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:25.800]   that information to be useful it's gathering 30 000 points to animate a face you need maybe
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:31.160]   20 or 30 you know so there you know it can it could dumb down that information uh fairly
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:35.000]   effectively and hand that back to you but it will be interesting to see if it's only letting you
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:42.120]   um animate something based on it um you know it'll but that means all the things they could do with
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:48.360]   this just do yeah uh it's this is to be sure it's not again it's not like a project tango where it's
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:53.160]   designed to be a 3d mapper no matter how you're using it this is designed to map a human face that's
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:59.000]   from a phone that's being held like a foot from the face but nonetheless there are even just from
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.960]   the point of view of fun if there were if if a developer were able to simply say if you want to
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:08.840]   scan a figurine that you've got on your anything you can put anything that will fit inside like a
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:14.680]   one foot by one foot by one foot box right that would be a cool thing to be able to get
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:22.120]   if in the ability to scan somebody's face and then have that data that you can then send to a 3d printer
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:29.720]   or use for graphics or whatever it's it's it's it's really really interesting i've although that
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:36.520]   does come up with another my only worry about uh about the face unlocking is that like uh
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:44.680]   barack obama to because he's the digital president a sat for a 3d portrait and so you can you can
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:51.880]   download a 3d a really good 3d model of uh a bust of barack obama so good that you can 3d print it
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:58.920]   and will be like a museum quality bust so could i then could i then like print this bust and just
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:04.680]   like keep it in the truck in my car just in case i'm out for lunch and i see barack obama is having
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.600]   at the other table and he's gone to the bathroom and he's left his phone behind i could simply like
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:13.880]   grab the phone take my 3d bust of barack obama i've been creating around and because it really is
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:19.480]   a 3d scan unlock his phone with it uh steven cold bear did something like that too uh where there's a
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:25.880]   3d printable uh scan of his face that's available so it's like are we gonna have to be really really
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:30.360]   careful about like what we do with 3d models of our faces well i don't think and again i think that
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:36.040]   they said in the in the presentation that you they those masks actually did not work um as far as
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:39.400]   opening those things so i think that there is a heat element there but i think that what's more
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:45.320]   interesting about that is is that uh imagine those 3d models that you have there of of steven cold bear
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.600]   or whatever being able to be animated by um you know being able to be animated by your face so you
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:57.880]   could take you could map steven go bear or or obama's head and map your animation to them and then
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:03.080]   theoretically comp that back into footage and it's true we're truly you know we're barreling
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:06.440]   towards an area where you really can't believe anything that you see you can't believe that people
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.640]   are saying what they're saying you can't believe you know all those things it doesn't matter if you
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:14.760]   could do it with my phone to be honest with you yeah people absolutely could do it with it that
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:20.760]   stuff computer but it will and and and you can generate um it doesn't take if you get multiple
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:28.680]   angles uh of just video frames especially as we move to 4k of someone um giving a speech you can
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:33.320]   derive the 3d model of their face and then you could be doing you know it kind of takes bad luck
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.320]   reading to a whole nother level yeah no being able to add stuff i have to say the animojis
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:43.160]   were that perfect they were pretty good they're better than saturday morning cartoons
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:49.160]   um i don't know i don't think the lip sync was all that good really oh do we have video of that
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:53.560]   karstin we can look at it man doesn't matter they're very very low resolution little models
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:58.760]   yeah or something that's being done live yeah well that's the point i mean you could do it perfectly
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:04.680]   if you weren't live somebody in the charams said that uh the reason you couldn't take out the
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.440]   obama bust is because in addition to mapping 3d mapping all the features there might be a
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:15.560]   thermographic map right we don't know that but there might be a thermographic map which would
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:21.400]   also not work with a bust uh you'd have to have blood vessels in exactly the same places and you'd
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:26.520]   have to right heat them up and all i'm saying that george washington had better improve the
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:33.400]   passcode on his phone from now on yeah uh let's see all right i was also i was also having some
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:36.840]   you know as as i'm thinking about this i'm thinking that maybe you can have like two-factor
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.720]   authentication by like buying a pair of grocho glasses and like setting it up so that you have to
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:46.600]   be it scans your it scans your face wearing the glasses so unless it's not just enough for to be
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:52.360]   my face else be my face wearing grocho marks glasses i do think that the anemoji might be the killer
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:58.040]   killer feature i think anemoji is not available on the front camera for the iphone 8 and the
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:03.480]   plus i'm just gonna say you might want to wait till november i i will make a prediction i think
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:09.400]   that the anemojis are going to be every bit as ubiquitous and popular as sending sketches to
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:15.000]   one another via your apple watch okay you're right i don't know i think that oh i know it depends on
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.880]   the age group but i my kid would my my daughter would she gets ahold of one of these phones remember
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:24.680]   photo booths like every that was like the great mac demo you know you just fire up photo booths not
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:30.040]   only the kids love it people goes oh i gotta i gotta have that computer right that's the one i want
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:37.080]   right turn me into an alien kershiv all seen snapchat now so i don't i don't see i now now you got me
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:42.200]   sad because it's it is going to be really fun like uh feature for kids i don't want to think about
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:48.360]   the fact that i live in a world in which someone is buying their 10 year old child not only the
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.280]   thousand dollar iphone but the thousand dollar iphone they had to spend three thousand dollars for
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:58.520]   because it is unattainable yeah it's what will the what will the aftermarket the ebay market be
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:04.600]   two to three x really i bet you yeah especially because if you want it for for the holidays you know
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:11.480]   it'll be intense yeah yeah it's it's gonna be it's certainly has changed some of my plans because i
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.680]   was already planning on buying one uh on the as soon as they become available just in case they're
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.760]   in short supply and i'd have to wait like several months to get a review loner and then just simply
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.240]   return it when i'm done with it now i'm like maybe i'll buy it and then when i'm done with it sell it
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:29.880]   and then you could yeah you know buy it for all the phones for the next five years
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.520]   buy a second buy a second hand me out of it we're looking
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:38.520]   all right final thoughts coming up in just a second because i do want to move on we've got another
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:45.720]   show we're sta- they're stacked up uh landing here at uh air twitch like a rainy dado here
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:51.480]   i showed they brought to you by word press that's where i make my home on the internet and if you're
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:57.560]   a business and you say well i don't need a website because i've got a facebook page or i've got a
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:03.720]   twitter account eh eh eh eh no no no first of all you don't want to predicate your whole
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.840]   internet presence on a company that could knock you off the internet with just you know a whim
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:15.400]   you need a page you call your own do you want when somebody searches for your restaurant do you want
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:21.000]   Yelp to be the first thing they find no that's why you go to wordpress.com and you set up
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:26.200]   your stunning website and i know why you haven't done this because it's a lot of what you say
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:31.240]   oh i don't want to become a web designer it's a lot of work no wordpress is easy whether you're
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:36.280]   looking to create a personal blog or a business site or both it's a simple thing to do they've
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:41.240]   got hundreds of templates beautiful designs to choose from you don't need experience and you
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.840]   don't need to hire someone although because wordpress is so dominant 28 percent of all the websites in
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.680]   the world 28 percent run on wordpress it's easy to find somebody who can help you but frankly you
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:58.840]   can do it i have confidence you can do it yourself choose a wordpress.com plan you'll be joining a
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:03.720]   lively community that's the other reason i love being on wordpress.com it is more than just a
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:08.440]   hosting company that is more than just the wordpress software it's a great community of other blogs
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:15.640]   and other businesses and of course great expert support 28 percent of all the websites run on
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:22.440]   wordpress find out why the web's most popular and most powerful platform i am my blog leo
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:28.760]   la port.com i'm a big i'm a big supporter of wordpress and by the way i've set up the blog by email so
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:33.720]   when i go on vacation i can just email my if because the internet slow sometimes when you're out in
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:42.280]   the real world away from this oasis it's 10 gigabit oasis wordpress.com/macbreak gets started today 15
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:52.920]   percent off your new plan yeah 15 percent off at wordpress.com/macbreak i i'm a i've been using wordpress since
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:41:00.760]   the two thousands and i love it wordpress.com we don't need to do pics this week unless you guys
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:08.920]   have brought any i think the pic is a new apple watch a new apple tv three new iPhones including an
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:15.800]   iPhone 10 which everybody's gonna want but cannot order until the end of October what is the actual
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:23.160]   date October 27th i think so yeah and then if you order October 27th you'll get it on November 3rd
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:28.040]   third yeah a week later you'll be the coolest person in town and you will be the one of the few
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:31.640]   the proud the broke how many people are going to be sitting there it gives everybody enough time
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:38.760]   to build their schedule around the fact they're going to be there at 12 1201 and our advice of course
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:44.440]   Friday you can order all the other stuff and our advice is to use the app on iOS right the i i
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:50.760]   store apple store app because that seems to be the best way to get into this yeah thanks also
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.400]   there are there are few people who are using that using the app to order so that in itself gets to
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:01.880]   the headline you have an advantage so suffice to say there are going to be a lot of people who are
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:07.000]   a lot a lot of people on October 28th are coming in late to work because they're up until 4am
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:17.240]   wondering oh no is it is it is it to 27th California time is it's it's it's California it's 9pm
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:23.720]   9pm east coast oh no it's so 3 3am east coast 3am oh you poor guys you got to get up early i
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:27.400]   remember actually i was on the east coast last year and i remember having to get up at 3 in the
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:33.320]   morning oh i uh i will be in france this year so i don't even know what time that is
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:38.920]   uh i think i will i don't think you'll have to get up do you will you have to get up this friday at
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:46.360]   midnight i don't know any short supply i don't think so i think it will be at all it'll always
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:51.400]   it'll always be do you want if you want to get the iphone 8 that is the color that you want the size
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:57.160]   that you want and the capacity that you want then and you want to have it as soon as you can get it
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:02.760]   on day one then yeah otherwise i don't know i think i i think they're kind of on top of it i think
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:07.000]   that maybe you'll as usual it'll be two or three weeks before you can just simply walk in the
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.760]   store and pick up whatever you want but there's but there are a lot of people for whom it's uh
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:16.120]   day of release is very important to them so yeah i wonder if the iphone 8 we now i think inevitably
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:21.160]   apple will say in in a month it's the fastest selling iphone we've ever made right of course but
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:27.640]   it feels like there's you know there's always that hovering over the horizon the next iphone but
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:32.200]   now it's actually tangible right i wonder if that's gonna impact it i think they can you know the
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:35.480]   great thing for apple is that they can afford it they can you know they can take a risk they've done
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.960]   before they kill the ipod with the iphone right but but they did it slowly this one is like they
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:44.200]   they can be taken a risk and just saying we're going after something and even if they didn't
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:48.680]   have a great uh a great quarter they would they be fine but i think also selling the watch and the
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:54.440]   apple tv at the same time before the end of the quarter you know in in hopefully good supply i
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.440]   think really put some in a position where it would be great it'd be great news for apple to say hey
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.920]   we didn't make as much with the phone but we have two other things that made a lot of money because
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:07.080]   that's something that a lot of investors worry about it matters it's the next thing well is that
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:11.080]   other things are coming in and you know i think the watch is now really growing into that other
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:18.280]   other i have to say this to me the series three not not that series zero one or two were bad but
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:23.320]   series three feels like the watch is coming into its own i think i think this is what apple envisioned
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:27.240]   this is what they wanted and they had to cut down to you know i think it wasn't there they weren't
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:31.080]   ready this is this is the watch that i think that they thought of when they started making it
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:35.560]   i don't i don't i disagree i think i think that what happened was they had no idea how to build
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:39.640]   this they had no idea what features it should be they had no idea whether they should sell it as
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:45.000]   this is the most wonderful accessory to your phone it took a it took a couple of years of watching
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.080]   people buy these and watching how they're using them to realize it uh-huh all we have to do is make
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:54.440]   it an amazing health app amazing health device and anything else is going to be a bonus and like i
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:59.000]   said earlier it's the the fact that now that they this this team now has a direction and a focus
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.320]   and a point of view that says that what can what can we do to make this a better fitness device a
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:08.520]   better health device and anything else can just go pound sand until the other health features are
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:12.920]   done so it really it really is super exciting to see what's happening with the apple watch like
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:17.400]   i said earlier i think that of all of all the things that were presented that's that's the product that
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:22.440]   really got me most excited that's not even necessarily because of the new hardware will you buy a new one
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:29.080]   i might i mean i i'm an android person and i like this apple watch so much that i bought i did buy
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:33.400]   i bought my second you have an edition are you that's the edition you're wearing is no no no this is
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:37.640]   this is the generation this is the first generation okay just basic aluminum one but i just bought but
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.440]   i bought a brand new like you know oh it's the band where it makes it look fancy yeah because they
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:47.080]   i like i still like my rainbow band but it makes it's it's kind of loud and sometimes you want to have
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:52.360]   something kind of simple but you know i mean that's your dress band the fact that i use it in airplane
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:58.840]   mode 24/7 uh and without connecting it to uh and i connect it to the phone maybe once or twice a
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:05.320]   week just to sort of boost up data uh between it shows you just what a great watch it is uh and also
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:09.160]   by the way if you keep it in airplane mode you get like two or three days of use out of it you don't
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:14.920]   have to get like a day and a half so i'm really excited for the day when apple simply says that
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:21.000]   so long as you introduce this via bluetooth to some sort of an ipad or an ios device sometime
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.360]   we're good or even better so long is at some point it's on a Wi-Fi network where you can access
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:31.880]   whatever server we need to simply get the help data off of it we're good uh because even as a
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:37.080]   device that does not connect it to any computer uh any uh phone whatsoever it's a really swell watch
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:42.920]   and i i guess i am sort of tempted to see the maybe in a few months time get the series three
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:49.880]   uh and maybe even get the lte version because uh as the the breakthrough with the apple watch i think
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:55.480]   even for apple to realize is that all they had to do was build a cool watch because there are 400
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.480]   dollar cool watches that aren't digital that uh aren't smart watches and people buy them and they
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:04.600]   love them and they got here they became the number one they they announced during the keynote this
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:09.560]   we are now the we used to be the number two watchmaker in the world now we're the number one watchmaker
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:13.800]   in the world again they didn't get there certainly by features they got there because it's just a
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:21.640]   cool watch well number two is rolex so maybe maybe not dollars per unit correct so
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:28.040]   so how many watches really how many watches does rolex so how could i was surprised i didn't see
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:32.280]   swatch or timex they're down there they were there they were there but what number two was rolex
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:36.280]   which really surprised me unless i misread that i'm out of misread maybe so maybe maybe the
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:40.280]   arc going by dollar volume just simply dollar units dollar i'm happy dollars i don't i'm gonna
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.960]   buy a red dot and put it right on there and then we're gonna make one i don't think you have the
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:49.400]   buy one that'll be my new watch no i i definitely want the new watch and uh i have to say there's a
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:56.040]   4k hole uh under my tv oh yeah i'm ready for then you know apple yeah i think the only things that i
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:03.240]   that i wish i saw when then in the in the uh iphone 10 was of course i really want a stylus because i
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:09.800]   you know i i have to like to entertain things no days i know i was coming out of my mind so you know
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:15.560]   being able to do a stylus also a uh a front front facing depth camera was something that i really hope
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.800]   for from an ar perspective as an ar developer i want to see this only rear facing right now it's
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:25.160]   rear facing so what is front facing matter because right now between those two cameras they don't
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.760]   really get a lot of great like they don't really understand the scene they're looking in that's
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:34.600]   why ar kid is kind of where it's at i have to say we thought this would be and everybody said the
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:40.280]   breakthrough in ar wait till you see what apple's doing show another game you know and again it's not
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:45.320]   it's isn't even technologically sophisticated as you pointed out as google's tango no no it's
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:51.880]   definitely not but it's also it's got but it's got but google had to go back and had to simplify
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:57.160]   you know you are had to simplify the ar solution because of that the i think that um tangos is
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:03.000]   as we've been doing with both both platforms and tango is a much more advanced uh understanding of
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.600]   the scene scenery around it i think apple's saying well we don't need to do that right now
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:11.640]   i was hoping to see something that was a surprise that that was gonna be a breakthrough in ar though
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:15.560]   i mean people is a riggan and now embrace it or is this just another pokemon go moment i mean
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:20.600]   people no i think that well ar is gonna you have two you have three of the largest companies in the
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:25.640]   world that are competing head to head for the ar v or google and apple before i guess because
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.040]   it's like facebook as well i mean facebook is also doing that and so i think that uh there's a lot of
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:34.760]   money getting flushed into the system and it's going to be there for a lot a while these these
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:40.360]   folks are looking at this as a long-term development um i think that a lot of these ar solutions exactly
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:46.200]   what we saw on in the demo was someone holding up something to play a game that is not compelling
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:49.800]   to me yeah i think it is not compelling to play a game where i'm holding this phone up i mean
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:54.200]   eventually your shoulders are gonna get tired you're gonna get you know so to me there's a lot of
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:58.920]   over the room but well there's a lot of great ar solutions if i know what this room looks like
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:02.840]   there's a lot of ar solutions that i can say i want to put this on the table or that on the wall
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:09.560]   but right now the phones the tango knows what that means but the but uh the iphone doesn't and
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:14.680]   that makes it much more it makes those games that they showed really cool it makes a lot of the
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:20.360]   real features of ar um not not available so so it it slows the ar the fact that it didn't happen
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:25.160]   it'll slow ar development down all i can say is i'm just glad i don't have to buy robert scobull
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:32.200]   dinner in paris thank god i don't think that was a hard bet no but again my mistake was not
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:37.640]   saying what are you gonna give me if you're wrong i forgot that right right i always forget that part
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:43.720]   uh mr andi and aqua chicago sometimes i'm sure you want to get off and file you've been taking notes
