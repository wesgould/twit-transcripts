[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly as we wait, we wait on Tenter Hooks for Apple's Q1 earnings call.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   We'll talk a little bit about what to be looking for, what information would be useful, what would be good, what would be bad.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I think it's going to be pretty good for Apple also.

[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   So, um, should we just wait?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Let's just sit here.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   We'll just sit here.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Have some coffee.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I think we should just say reckless and irresponsible things that are simply speculative because we don't know where it's going to be.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   We got no last opportunity to pull things out of our butt.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   That's Andy Inako. Chicago Sun Times. That's how a real reporter works.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Andy is also the, I don't know, what else? You're so many things.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The purveyor of fine blog posts at cwob.com.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And he does many other podcasts, including a knock-coz almanac.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   God bless the people who are silly enough to pay me to express my opinions in both writing and audio form.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Isn't that nice? Isn't that a nice thing when you're in search for it?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Keep the scam going for another 30 years.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I know. You know how I feel here. I feel like any minute now.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Pretty sweet, isn't it?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Yeah, it's sweet. But any minute now, they're going to find out.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Also here, Renee Ritchie, he's no longer in Winnipeg.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He has now moved his operations to South Beach.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   South Bay. I'm beneath you, Leo.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   South Bay. You mean like San Jose? Oh, you're like near the fruit company.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Yeah, I was hoping to make it up to the brick house, but I just couldn't get there in enough time.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It was very sad.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Whereas Merle and Mann calls it the paper company.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So you're not, you actually thought it would be a good idea for the quarterly earnings report to be in Cupertino?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Oh, it was completely coincidental that this one. I had actually forgotten that it was this week.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Okay. All right. Well, we know you have to...
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   In sunny Winnipeg in two weeks, that makes everyone feel better.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Nice.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Nice. Also here, Alex Lindsay. Hello, Leo.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Nice to see you, Alex. Good to be here.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   The pixel core picks core.com.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Apple, the reason there will be news is the quarterly earnings come out today.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   This is Q1 for Apple. Historically, not a big quarter, right?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   No, no, no, this is the...
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   This is the big one. This is the big one.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   This is the one that reflects the holidays sales. Okay.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   What are we looking for?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Billions.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It turns out they probably made a couple billion dollars, at least.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   That's what we hear. A couple billion.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   The sad thing is that they're going to make record money.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   They'll probably make the biggest quarter ever, but all everyone's going to pay attention to is the presumed shrinkage in the second quarter.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Well, and the interesting thing is, is that when we say they're going to make more money,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   that doesn't mean the most ever for Apple. I think that's the most ever for anyone, right?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yeah, but Wall Street doesn't care about today.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   They want to know what's happening tomorrow, and tomorrow, I mean, the bigger the iPhone gets, the bigger it has to fall.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Right.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   The guidance is the big thing, like what's going to happen.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Right.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Okay, what should we be looking for, Renee?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   So, the interesting thing now is that people are presuming that there's a lot of economic pressure in general.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   The global markets are down. China specifically is down.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And the iPhone, every quarter, people think that iPhone is going to hit saturation, that there's just nowhere left for it to go.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   There's not enough upgradeers, not enough cross-graders, not enough new customers.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It's going to get to a point where everyone who has an iPhone wants one, and then inevitably that's going to stall.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And the problem is that Wall Street keeps looking at Apple as a company that needs to grow more.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   They look at it almost like a widget vendor. They don't look at it like a services company.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And they don't look at it like an established company like Coca-Cola or Gillette, because, you know, razor blades have been around forever.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So, the pop has been around forever.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So, for me, it's mostly a perceptions problem.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But I think that for Wall Street, when you're not looking at, when you're investing in a company, you're not looking at where they are right now.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   What you're looking at is how much more are they going to keep on growing?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   How much is my stock going to go up when I put money into it?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And if I don't think that it's going to keep on going up, it doesn't matter whether it can still make...
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   a trillion dollars a year. It doesn't matter. If it's not growing, it means the stock is not going to necessarily go up.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So, unless it's going to give me back dividends, which Apple has done a little bit, which I think is a waste of money,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   then the stock is going to start.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   You know, people are going to start stepping away from it just because it's not a good investment.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It's not growing. And it's not producing anything, any kind of return for the investors' money.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   That's absolutely true. But the problem Apple has historically had is that everyone assumed the next quarter was going to be destruction.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Like, this quarter was great, but next quarter, it's like being in Vegas and the guy next to you keeps winning.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And you think that every time you wins, like, the next chance is going to be even bigger chance that he's going to fail,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   even if he's really, really good at what he does. And Apple has the same chance every quarter.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Just, you know, the law of large numbers, what goes most come down.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   There's a lot of stereotypes that get thrown around.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   But I think Wall Street's lost a huge opportunity on Apple for the last decade just by presuming doom and gloom every quarter.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And I think that, you know, at some point it has to slow down because they aren't really diversifying enough yet.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I think that, but, you know, when we look at the watch or whatever, I think the watch is doing probably, I don't think we've seen numbers yet,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   but probably as well or better than the original iPhone did.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I mean, you know, I think that we're not much behind it.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   So it's something that, you know, that could evidently, I mean, eventually build up.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I think the stuff that with where they could go with Apple Pay, I think is pretty interesting.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I think we looked at a couple of things coming out and I think that diversification could yield a lot down the road.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Yeah, I don't really care what the stock, I mean, the stock market thinks because they have different interests than we do as Apple users.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Right, right.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Apple followers.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   But I guess we have to pay attention to the stock market because, first of all, if it weren't for the stock market, we'd never get these quarterly reports.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Right.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And we wouldn't get any information at all.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And when the stock goes down, it's a good opportunity for Apple to do buybacks, which I imagine we're going to see more buybacks over this quarter.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   They have a lot of cash at hand.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   That's the pressure they've gotten.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   You know, what I'm hoping is they don't waste time on dividends.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   They really just keep on doing buybacks because I still think it puts Apple in a position that at some point in five or six years, you know, they've whittled down that the stock a lot.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Right.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So I think that that would make more sense for that.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And it's a good bargain right now, I think.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's really interesting to someone who doesn't have, I think, under-
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   The price of earning is only 11 bucks.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That's pretty low, isn't it?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's $10.88.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Price to earnings.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Price to earnings.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   That means the earnings are high, the stock price is relatively low.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Yeah, I think it's a good value right now.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I mean, and that's the beginning of someone doesn't own any stocks.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I don't own two stocks.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Well, it would be, yeah, I don't, I just do, you know, funds.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   But you're baskets.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.200]   And the larger the basket, the better as far as I'm concerned.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   What would be it?
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   Let's see price to earnings.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.400]   Let's compare it to Ford.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.200]   Ford would be a good one, which is F. Ford has a good letter.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   It's price.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.600]   It's price to earnings is almost the same, $10.27.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600]   Yeah, and the Apple Apple.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.880]   So it's kind of like a- If they become a value company over a growth company, then that's
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:44.640]   the kind of, you know, that's the kind of ratio you'd expect.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.040]   Google is- Or Alphabet is $33.42.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.840]   Yeah, three times with Apple.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.440]   It's theoretically- It's theoretically it's considered a growth company.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.280]   Wonder what Twitter is.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.880]   Apple's problem is that it's profitable.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.880]   If you don't make a profit, you can hope that eventually the profit will be super huge.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.080]   But if you make a profit, there's nowhere to go but down.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   Isn't it funny?
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.680]   It's kind of a no win.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.480]   Twitter, I can't- Twitter doesn't even have a price turning.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   I don't know what that means.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   Oh, for Twitter.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   It says Dash.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   It says Dash.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.480]   What does that mean?
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.480]   Dash.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.280]   It's not a good day to look it up.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.480]   Is that mean negative?
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.480]   It could be negative.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.880]   No, it can't be negative.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.880]   Oh, it could be negative.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   I think it is negative.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.680]   That means you're making less- It's rough.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.880]   If you have no earnings, then the price turning is negative.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.000]   That's not a- It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It's not a good thing to laugh.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I think Apple has to go past the phone at some point.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   The computers are noise at this point.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   iPads are a little above noise as far as revenue goes.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Maybe I want to take a guess what Amazon's price turning is.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Three Quazillion.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Just a guess.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   52.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   867 dollars.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   23 cents.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   So that would be an overpriced stock.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I think so.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   They never make a difference.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   It's got potential Leo.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.520]   So that's part side.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:33.080]   I think the reason it's so high is because they have a lot of gross and they never have
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   any net.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   So it creates this really, really high.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.080]   They're very low profit.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   They just keep on reinvesting.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.080]   They just control it.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   They have a knob.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.080]   There's a little knob in Jeff B. A.S.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.080]   It's just...
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.080]   It says let's not make any money.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.000]   Let's keep offering them.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.840]   But I think that the car, I think that Apple's moving down, it's an entirely new and
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.000]   new industry to disrupt.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.520]   What are you going to be looking for, Renee?
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.000]   You're going to be looking for information about sales, right?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.600]   Well, mostly I'll focus on next...
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.280]   It's going to be interesting this quarter just to see the amount of stuff sold, but also
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.560]   what the ongoing, for example, how many people switched from Android again this quarter?
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.520]   How many new owners there are?
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.240]   App Store revenue, because that's been going on a consistent growth curve.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   What iPad...
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.400]   They're not going to break out Apple Watch, but Apple Watch is going to be glumped together
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.640]   with a bunch of other stuff, but it apparently has had a very good holiday quarter, so has
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.640]   the iPad.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.640]   And they're going into next quarter.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.280]   That's going to be interesting, because iPad's been down, down, down every quarter, quarter
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.440]   after quarter for a couple of years.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.640]   And so this one thing I would be looking for is is the iPad Pro going to staunch the bleeding?
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.120]   Well, also a lot of companies said that iPad was a big seller.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.040]   It was in the top 10 for Best Buy, very close to the top of the top 10 list for Best Buy
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   over the holidays.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.880]   It is sort of like one of those seasonal purchases.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.120]   People do get you a tablet for the holidays.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.640]   Maybe we now know what the product cycle is for a tablet.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   Maybe it's four years or something.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.080]   Well, I don't think it's such a different product.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.560]   I don't think that that's going to be very relevant.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.960]   Also remember that a lot of the hard rivers and really short supply, when people were
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.920]   most eager to go out and grab it.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.480]   So if the numbers are less than what we think it, what we assume they should be, I don't
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.600]   think that's going to be terribly significant.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.760]   And I think that...
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.440]   I think we could see explosive growth in the iPad if we saw things like the iPad Mini with
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   pencil.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.560]   I think going away from that whole...
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:29.120]   I just feel like my iPad is a completely different device with the pencil.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.280]   What I find is that the Pro is bigger than I want to carry around, but I still want to
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.560]   be able to draw stuff out.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.320]   And I think that we could...
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.720]   Adding all those features back into the smaller iPads I think could end up with a lot of people
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   upgrading.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   You're just taking their...
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   I'm jumping from one to the other.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   Absolutely.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.320]   Apple pencil is the iPad with Force Touch is to the iPhone.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.120]   It'll be nice to have Force Touch on the iPad, but there are more people who will buy an
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.680]   iPad to get Apple pencil than there will be for people to get access to Force Touch in
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680]   that device.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.320]   Just a note, we do know our websites down.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.320]   We're working on it.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.920]   I didn't pay the bill.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.920]   144.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.920]   I've been there.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.440]   It wasn't for the website.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:14.480]   It was for the Redis Labs cash, but when that goes down, everything goes off.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.480]   But no, I...
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.480]   That's what that TV is working.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.480]   It's hard to keep...
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.400]   That's why I've got payment for my domains 10 years in advance.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.400]   Well, I would have done that.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   I had no idea.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.840]   It was tied to my personal credit card.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.840]   Exactly.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.920]   It's almost like buying a house where it's like, "Okay, great.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.240]   I've written the check for $378,000.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   Oh, wait.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.040]   I need another person to check for $1,700.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   Oh, wait.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.040]   This is the person who needs to get a check for $420.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.040]   It's...
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.120]   You know a site that is down right now, I'm just going to say this is sad.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.280]   The Abevagoda.com site is down.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.840]   Abevagoda finally passed away.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.840]   Sorry.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.840]   I...
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.960]   Because everybody like me is refreshing it just to see if they got updated.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   They didn't.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.960]   There was...
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   And Paul...
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.000]   I think Paul Kudrowski on my Twitter feed posted, "You had one job."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   And he linked the Abevagoda.com site.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.720]   And I went to it and said he's still alive.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.080]   But unfortunately, the news set...
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.440]   But he lived a good life, 92 years old.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.440]   Yep.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.600]   It was an internet meme for a long time because people thought he was dead years ago, decades
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   ago.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600]   Right, soon.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.960]   And he's not.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.600]   The great Abevagoda, who is not merely one of the stars of Barney Miller, the TV show,
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   was of course...
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   I see it.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.960]   ...in The Godfather and was brilliant in The Godfather.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.920]   He did get killed in the first movie though, so...
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.600]   Tell Mikey was nothing personal.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   Oh, he's nothing personal.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   I always liked him.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.120]   Yes.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.360]   Here's a picture of him dancing in a wombat suit at a fish concert.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.360]   There's that.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.360]   The issue.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.360]   92.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   You know, for all the crap I give Twitter, where else are you going to see that?
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.600]   The first place that you find out about these things is on Twitter.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:09.800]   And that's also the first place you see people dancing in a wombat suit on a fish concert.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.080]   Like we go to the stock news in just a moment.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.880]   I do want to say, "Who told me about these pins?
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.880]   My pins came."
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   This one online.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.880]   This one online.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.880]   From Milk.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.680]   Remember this, we said that these guys would be put out of business quickly, but I guess
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.680]   no.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   Tessio.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   That's it.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680]   He was Tessio.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   What's that?
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   Is that what you said?
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   I didn't hear that.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.680]   Honey, I would expect that from Cemento.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   Cemento.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   Cemento.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   No.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680]   Tessio was always smarter.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680]   Is it smart?
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:42.880]   Great triangulation yesterday where we interviewed the fourth employee of Apple, Bill Fernandez,
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.840]   who was instrumental in building early model Apple IIs left briefly in 1978.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.880]   He was the guy who introduced jobs and was.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.840]   He had some great memories.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.680]   I asked him if he'd seen the movie and he said, "No, I'm not going to see the movie.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.120]   Steve was my best friend.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.480]   It's too painful for me to see a movie about Steve."
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.480]   Right.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.960]   It says, "One more pin."
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   Isn't that great?
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.360]   Isn't that great?
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360]   You know, I got two.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   I'm going to give you one.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.360]   Oh, thank you.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   I give you all one, but I don't have four.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   I didn't bring it out for your whole class.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.560]   That was a good reason to come up here.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.000]   They probably already got the C&D, so.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.080]   This might be a collector's item.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.760]   Actually, we can continue.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.200]   Have we said everything there is to say about the quarterly report?
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   I don't want to belabor it.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   We'll know in an hour.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.120]   The only thing I would have wanted to add is that it's always interesting because I
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:42.160]   can't think of another situation in which you hear Apple telling their own story, but
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:49.280]   they're not in front of a crowd of five to 600 people of whom 100 or 200 are Apple employees.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.200]   It's not real PR.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.080]   It's where the stuff that they say in this venue, they will get sued if it's not open
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.720]   and accurate.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   There's a chance for people to ask them direct questions and get direct answers immediately
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.720]   afterward.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.960]   But as though you're rifling through Apple's desk drawers here, but it's always interesting
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.240]   to see what they say, what they don't say, and what they want to lean towards as they
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.240]   go.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.720]   I'm really curious to see if they say anything about iPad Pro sales.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:25.800]   Really curious to see if they try to put a finer point on Apple Watch sales, but it's
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:31.480]   always a good time to pay close attention and it would be very, very, very good at spinning
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.160]   to make sure that the things that you were saying about Apple for the past three months
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.600]   are actually proven by whatever numbers they are going to go and release today.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:45.560]   Also, I think very interesting that I would like to hear about, because I ads was killed
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:51.400]   just a week ago, if they talk about that, about Apple News, because they were under
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:58.600]   reporting subscriptions to the publishers for a long time, a couple of issues there,
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.880]   and I'm very curious what they say about Apple Music.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.120]   So I'm going to be interested in what they say about services.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.200]   Of course, I want to see Mac sales up because I mean, I still love the Mac.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.040]   I don't want to ever give up on the Mac.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:15.400]   iPad sales, I'm my gut is iPad Pro is not going to be a big seller.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.560]   Those who love it, love it.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.320]   And boy, the new GarageBand and iPad Pro.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.960]   But I don't think that iPad is a big part of their business.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.560]   It's really about the iPhone now, isn't it?
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.560]   Well, I think it is.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.600]   I think they need to move past that, some degree, but I think what will be interesting
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.520]   is also how much they talk about encryption.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.640]   This has been a big push and I wonder if they'll use this as an opportunity to say a couple
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.040]   of things about the importance of it.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.320]   It seems to be something that they talk about pretty much every time you let them talk in
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.320]   public.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.200]   And Tim Cook has said, and somebody in your chatroom pointed this out, we don't look
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.840]   at, we don't go quarter by quarter.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   We're not that kind of company.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.600]   They don't have to be what you have $200 million in.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   And they shouldn't be.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.360]   I mean, that's kind of the bane of, you know, a business in America these days is this kind
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.040]   of focus on the short term results.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.960]   And it's great that Apple doesn't have to do that.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.760]   Well, and I think the advantage of them, whether they ever decide to become private or whatever,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.720]   I think one of the advantages of doing stock buybacks is that the impact of the stock on
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.560]   the company is reduced every time they do that.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.840]   And so as they do it more and more and more, it really makes them, maybe they don't get
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.920]   rid of all the stock and stay a publicly traded company.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   But the fact that people are selling or really becomes noise to Apple if they can continue
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   to do buybacks.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.400]   And when the stock goes down, it gives them an opportunity to do that cost effectively.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.680]   I wonder if there might ever be a time where they wouldn't announce that they're going
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.080]   to have a couple of down years, but they're saying that part of our plan for the future
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:46.640]   is to focus on this big stuff that's going to take us two or three or four years to even
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.040]   engineer, let alone bring to market.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.720]   And so we're perfectly okay if people are upset with us for not having record profits
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   every quarter as usual.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.880]   And if you are so upset by that that you want to sell some of your stock, that's great.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.280]   There are going to be people waiting in Cupertino to buy it from you.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.120]   And I think that the, again, I think that there are many things that they're working
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.040]   on or that are rooming to be working on that I think it could be really a big deal.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.760]   I think that the cars have done well.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.160]   I mean, I think the Tesla's exciting.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.160]   It's really expensive.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.160]   I just bought one.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.160]   You bought a Tesla?
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   I don't have it yet.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.560]   You know, that's Tesla's one of those things where you buy it and then a couple of years
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.560]   later you get it.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.680]   I was going to buy, I was thinking about a Tesla and then I decided to buy an encoder.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   It's kind of like that.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.040]   Oh, no, it's exactly like that.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.000]   So, but I would, but see, I was a dumb, I figure only these three years, it's going to take
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.240]   Apple a few years to get it.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240]   No, no, I'm project tight.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.240]   No, I was very close.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.240]   Four wheels.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.240]   I got the X.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.240]   Did you really?
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.240]   When does it show up?
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.840]   The giant iPhone charger is what it really does on wheels.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.840]   Is it a 90?
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   It's got a 90 kilowatt iPhone charger.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   Nice.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.240]   I think I'm charged for the day.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   It will also drive.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.200]   It turns out it also drives it once in a while.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.800]   Not only that, but if the studio ever loses power, it will just voicely like park it against
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.840]   the wall like one of those Tesla home.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.840]   Exactly.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.200]   Leo, it might be delayed a bit.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   Why?
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   Oh, crap.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   It's been a fire.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   It's been a fire.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.440]   Tesla factory in Fremont.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.440]   You know what?
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.680]   I'm just snake bit.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.720]   My boss just got his Tesla X. He's been showing it off.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   He did?
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.560]   See, I'm trying to keep up with your boss.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.360]   Yeah, he put up a video.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   He was pretty happy.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.160]   He's been talking just to Winnipeg.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.160]   What color did he get?
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.160]   Did he get it?
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.600]   Okay, so I was thinking, so I'm driving a car from the future show.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.080]   It should look like it's in the future.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.320]   So I was going to get a white car with white seats, so be like riding in the Disney model
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   rail.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   Right.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   But then Lisa talked to me and said you shouldn't do that.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.480]   It's a very bad idea.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.880]   Anyway, I'm kind of a black man.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.240]   Now that there's a fire at the factory, I think it may be even longer.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   I tried to call them.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   I hope it's on a battery fire.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.240]   I tried to call them.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.200]   I realize now what a doofus I must have sound like.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.080]   I was trying to find out when it was going to, like, okay, so when will I get it?
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   I don't know.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.760]   I said, but, well, but I kind of need to know because my lease for that in September,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.760]   will I get sooner?
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.760]   I don't know.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.760]   Will I get a layer?
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.760]   I don't know.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.760]   Is there anybody there who knows?
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.760]   I asked.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.760]   I don't know.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.640]   So he said, I'll send an email.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   But now I realize...
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   Now I evacuated the building.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.320]   She was telling the absolute God's truth.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.800]   No one knows.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.040]   How long do your boss wait?
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.800]   He must have gotten a signature.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.680]   He must have gotten the signature or something, right?
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.680]   I'll stick to it.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   I have the video.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.200]   I was trying to stick it in the comments for the...
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.760]   I don't want to make you worry, but did you buy this car on Kickstarter by any time?
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   Sorry, it's not an awfully familiar one.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.760]   I did just order.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.380]   I think there's something wrong with me.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.160]   I did just order floating Japanese Bonsai.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   I saw that.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.780]   I really want a floating Japanese Bonsai.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.020]   Bonsai is wrong!
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.360]   Don't buy anything.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.660]   It's like, funding something on Kickstarter is like giving up a loan to a personal friend.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.920]   You do it on the principle that I will never see this money again.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.080]   I'm cool with that.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.300]   That's why almost the only thing I ever fund on Kickstarter are great projects where even
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.840]   if I never get the book or the CD or the video, I am pleased that I'm at least funding
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.320]   the development of this thing.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.360]   The funny thing is that the Kickstarter stuff comes out so much later than you funded it.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.000]   It's like Christmas because you just get this box in the mail.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   What is this?
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.440]   I didn't order anything from G&H and then you open it up and you're like, "Whoa!"
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:45.060]   I don't have any USB ports on my computer anymore that work with this.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.060]   Okay!
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   Exactly!
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.060]   Wow!
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.060]   Centronics!
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.060]   50 pin!
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.860]   It's got an 80B port!
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.860]   Hmm.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:57.580]   Yeah, it's great when you get an iPhone 4S accessory when you just bought your 5S.
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.980]   That's where it takes the charger.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.980]   It was white-ly.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.980]   I'll wait with a black trim that you see.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.740]   I almost did that too because again, it's like the future.
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.720]   But instead I got some boring color that just looks like regular car.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   But it's okay.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.400]   I can't make that kind of a loss of firm commitment to always wearing clean clothes.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   I can't.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   Right!
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.400]   That's what Lisa said.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   She said, "You don't get white.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   What are you crazy?"
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   We have a 13-year old.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.920]   I'm not going to get a swab, but exactly.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.800]   Two years later, it's just the slightest non-white.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   That's what I thought.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   It'll yell at that.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   That came off my mind.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   But Elon says it won't.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   Elon says, "No, no, no.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.800]   These seats.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   This is space-age material.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   He calls it vegan leather."
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:43.520]   I have that on the 1999 sedan that I have.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.520]   That's what I wanted.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   Is that what your boss got?
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   I called it vinyl.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   No, no, this is the guy.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.920]   Yeah, this is another guy.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.320]   Look at the fob is the shape of your Tesla.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.440]   That's when the doors work.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.440]   That's what they look like.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.440]   I have the 16th Stormtrooper.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.440]   Does that look like a Stormtrooper?
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.440]   Yeah, my wife.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.440]   I just took the video in the...
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.080]   I want to let me buy the Stormtrooper version.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   It looks pretty hot.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.080]   It'll be fun.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.240]   All they can tell you, the white seats in general are...
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   Yes, a bad idea.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   I know.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.240]   We shot something for Virgin America before they were flying.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.920]   They have those white seats in the first class.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.720]   One of the guys left the mark on it.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.160]   There's a lot of stress.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.320]   There's a lot of stress about it.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.320]   Keep talking.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   I'm in contact with the redest labs.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.320]   I'm trying to get our same work.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   Yeah, so you guys...
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.320]   Pretty much after that...
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   Take it from here.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.440]   Pretty much after that shoot that I decided I never want white seats ever.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.440]   Since...
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.800]   If we're going to need to kill time, I also bought my own vehicle, a brand new vehicle
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.880]   on Friday, just before the snow.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.840]   It is first new vehicle I've bought like ever.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.520]   And it is a beautiful 2016 Trek 7.2 FX bicycle.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.000]   Very good.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   And technology, it moves in all directions.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.360]   And if you blink, you'll miss it.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:09.960]   I stopped riding the swear to God, the 1983 Univega I bought in school because 10 speeds
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:15.280]   were not enough to get my butt up hills as of like 10 or 12 years ago.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.800]   So here's the video, your boss?
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   Oh, let's see your boss's Tesla.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   Oh, it's the same one.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   We already said that.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   That's not your boss.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   Don't play that.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   That's okay.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.840]   So it's zero to 60 and never?
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:37.680]   It's just that with 10 speeds on that old bike, I would ride around and at some point
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.520]   there'd be a hill where now I'm transportation for the bicycle because I have to get off
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.720]   and just push the bike up the hill or die.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.080]   And I thought that it would be less embarrassing to push the bike than to be not failure to
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   resuscitate.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:59.120]   But I took this thing for a test drive on Friday and I was actually looking for like hills
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.040]   and like there's so many gears in this thing.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.640]   It's like at the very, very worst, I'm going up that hill at the same speed at which I would
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.440]   be walking but I'm still riding the bicycle.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.440]   And I can't ride it.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.800]   And it's also like I've got the it's in the shop because I've got them like installing
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.520]   a whole bunch of things at add-ons on it.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.480]   But it's like I'm in on Google Maps training for, okay, well, I often go there.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.480]   That's within bicycling distance.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.520]   Okay, well, when I need to drop something out of FedEx, that's within bicycling distance.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.240]   And you feel dumber and dumber to realize that pretty much I almost never go anywhere
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.480]   that I couldn't conceivably ride a bike.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:40.040]   You know that with enough fortitude in the right weather, the twit houses in bicycle
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.040]   distance.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.400]   I mean, you just have to from anywhere.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.640]   Yeah, I mean, a lot of hotel stops.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.320]   But yeah, yeah, you know, a few significant portages at Great Lakes.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.360]   Maybe you could do it.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.360]   You could do it, Andy.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.360]   You could do it.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.360]   You could do it.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.360]   You could do it.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.800]   If you get like if you like your best Western to sponsor me, I will go from Boston to the
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.000]   twit to the brick house.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.520]   I'm working on it right now.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.520]   So I want to.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.520]   I'll be thinking about it.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:12.320]   I'll be thinking about a Panera card and a Chipotle card.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.640]   I will eat a Panera's in the morning Chipotle.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:21.320]   Now to get back to Mac issues though, do you have car play in the in the track?
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:26.440]   Really, really inconvenient to have that car battery in the rear deck so I could have
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.280]   that big Pioneer head in the bars.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.960]   But it on the test right it worked kind of.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:37.400]   But that is kind of the fun part of this because I've been walking like forever and like always
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.640]   never using like the bike button on all these different apps.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.080]   And now I'm like, okay, well, what kind of electronics do I want on this thing?
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.680]   And the nice thing about the Trek is that it actually has like built built into like the
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.440]   part of the frame is an actual like pod that you can insert like a sensor so it doesn't
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.440]   hang off the side.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.440]   Right.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.440]   Of course that will that will be weather sealed.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.200]   It will communicate by Bluetooth.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   But now it's like it took me all of about.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.640]   It's not as though I decided in five or ten minutes.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.560]   But the wire cutter, this was the wire cutter's recommendation for a commuter bike.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.040]   And the more I read about it, like elsewhere, the more I was sure that it was least a good
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.040]   starting point.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.080]   Then when I wrote it, it's like, okay, perfect.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:23.120]   Now it's going to take me like eight times as long to choose an app for my phone to communicate
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.840]   with this pod thing because I unfortunately, Russ, I don't know anything about bicycles.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.000]   And I was willing to trust an expert who is a very good communicator with these.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.840]   So I know about apps and I know how things communicate.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.040]   I know about battery life.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.000]   So I'm going to be the expert here.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.640]   It's like you're you come to appreciate you like someone who will just simply say, if
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.360]   you don't want to read very, very far in the first three sentences, I will tell you just
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.200]   get the Trek FX.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.480]   That's why I like wire cutter, right?
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.760]   The whole idea is, you know, there's, there's one.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.120]   This is, I mean, I'm probably going to do a blog post or a column about it.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:02.280]   It's like the for things that I don't know, I don't feel as though I know much about it.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.680]   I'm now at the point where I will just simply buy whatever they tell me to buy.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.880]   And this is, this is it.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.640]   I didn't just go out and this is like a $450 bike.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.520]   So it's not like I just like, okay, whatever.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.560]   I did like, you know, look at message boards and talk to friends were vice versa.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.960]   But for everything else, I bought the rack that they recommended.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.800]   I bought the lights they recommended.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.360]   I bought like all the other accessories that they recommended.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.040]   I didn't buy the helmet they recommended, but only because they couldn't, I couldn't
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.560]   find it locally.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.680]   And I definitely wanted to try it on locally.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.840]   But I read their entire description start to finish where they said, look, even if you
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.040]   spend just 20 bucks for helmets, lonesome has a certification, they're pretty much all
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.040]   the same.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.840]   It's all about comfort and convenience.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.280]   And so I can't say enough nice things about wire cutter.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   Awesome team.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.920]   And they've grown now to do home and everything.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.840]   And I friends who, and I friends who, it's another thing that's nice thing is having friends
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.840]   who work there.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.120]   So you know that, oh, isn't that okay, so I trust these people.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.880]   They're not idiots.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.960]   By the way, it does.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   It does.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:05.760]   I do remember Steve Jobs in the Walter Isaacson biography talks about buying a washing machine.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   You remember that?
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.760]   Yes.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.640]   And they were just testing for weeks.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.840]   Making his family research.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:16.840]   And they would just have discussions at dinner about which washing machine they can't.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:22.800]   They finally settled on one that took a very, very long time, but made your clothes really,
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   really soft.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.000]   And then he had no furniture for a long time too.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.400]   He was setting for that side.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.240]   It had to be perfect.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.920]   So yeah, I'm more like you, Andy.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   Just tell me what the best one is.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.920]   I'll get that.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.160]   And I realize that too on the radio show.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.080]   People call in and ask for recommendations.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.520]   And in the past, I would say, well, you know, Lenovo's good.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.520]   Dell makes it pretty good.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.520]   No, I'm not.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.520]   Just say one.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.520]   And that's it.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.520]   But why are you going to buy it?
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.520]   I did.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.560]   I went through the same thing when I was buying my camera a few years ago where this is like
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.480]   the intersection between I feel as though I know a lot about digital cameras.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.080]   I also feel as though I know about a lot about photography in general, but I was also
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.240]   through a lot of opinions that I really, really value.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.120]   And it was also giving me a lot of every technical review was giving me so much information
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.200]   that I thought, OK, let's take a look at this low light comparison.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.800]   Let's take a look at this graph that DXO has.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.160]   And I really came to realize that it really affected the way that I write my own reviews
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.400]   in which I really feel as though it's my responsibility to make sure in the first couple
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.520]   of paragraphs, I at least let you know where things are going.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.240]   And if I'm sure if I'm going to be talked about three or four, I will say right at the
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.880]   top, this is my favorite keyboard.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.640]   And here's why, but I'll show you exactly why why these three are pretty good.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.240]   It looks like it looks like it's at some point you get so bogged down in graphs and
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.240]   starts the camera stuff.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   I was putting myself through hell.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.040]   I found this perfect one, but it's like this is unnecessary information.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.240]   I felt guilty for the way that I was reviewing cameras earlier because I came to believe
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.280]   that I thought that my reviews were, I do think my reviews were positive and helpful,
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.480]   but there were details that I maybe could confuse people like, here is this picture
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.640]   blown up to 400%.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.080]   So you can see this bit of noise here.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.440]   But I think that one of the things I'm thinking about starting, I stay in a lot of hotel
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.040]   rooms and I've been threatening to review hotel rooms, you know, and because it's like,
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   that's a good idea.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.040]   And that's very useful.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.520]   Thank you on behalf of everybody on the internet.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.440]   All right, I'll start doing my own little reviews.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.800]   I'll take a little pictures and everything else.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   That's great.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   And Amazon reviews are good.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   Those are good.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   But people, everyone does something different.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.200]   My whole thing is, is here's the deal.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.160]   I'm going to, I'm going to nick you if I don't get a full size ironing board and iron.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.160]   Okay.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   I'm going to nick you.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.160]   You know, if you know, there's certain like things that you have needs beyond those
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.160]   and more.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.960]   But I'm going to say I'm just going to have a little charge.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   It says, it's just me.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.960]   It's just me.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   No, you can decide.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.440]   I'm just going to tell you, I went to the hotel room and these are the things it had.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.440]   These are the things it didn't have.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.520]   And then we can talk about all the subjective stuff.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.560]   And this is Lisa, not me talking.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.480]   Hotel rooms that don't have electric plugs in the bathroom.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.840]   Because then you can't blow dry your hair.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.960]   She has to go out in the room and blow dry her hair.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.360]   And apparently it must be because we asked, we were in a very, very fancy French hotel,
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.800]   the Mandarin in France, in Paris, beautiful hotel.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   No.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.720]   Brand new went down to the desk.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.440]   Is there, am I missing something?
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.080]   Is there not a plug in the bathroom?
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.720]   They said, no, no, is not safe.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.720]   Men, no, Mr. Leball.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.720]   Is not safe.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.960]   So I noticed that I very rarely see them in 220 hotel rooms.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.800]   Yeah, that's because it isn't safe.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   It's 220.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.000]   No matter what the circuit is, you're still going to get a shock.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.440]   So the more and more rooms now are putting USB ports in the room, which I do it by the
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   bed.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   It's going to be nice.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   That's nice.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.400]   So in Singapore, for instance, all the hotels have those ultimate, like every plug can go
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   into it, into the wall.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.840]   No matter where you come and what country you're from, except for maybe South Africa,
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.160]   because you guys are crazy.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.800]   It's like this combination, I think I haven't had one.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.240]   Of course you have one.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   What were you saying, Renee?
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.880]   I was saying, a lot of hotels still don't even have a plug near the bed.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   So if you want to try to--
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.880]   I know.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.880]   It's ridiculous.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.960]   Like the plug is across the room on the floor hidden behind the dresser because they
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   don't want you to use it.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.960]   So I unplug the clock.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.960]   I mean, this is what I--
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.560]   That's what I carry two of those.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.340]   So the thing is, though, in Singapore, I've never been to a Singapore hotel that doesn't
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.360]   have this-- every plug looks like this.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   Because it has--
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.360]   Because every-- here's a news flash.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   If you're a hotel, people are coming from other countries.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.360]   Right.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   Please.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360]   All you have to do is do this.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.360]   So it's a weird plug.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.360]   It looks like an alien human.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   Right.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.720]   But it has enough holes in it that you could plug in almost anything.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.840]   And this one will actually fit South Africa.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.560]   South Africa is the hardest one because of these huge browns.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.560]   Those British ones are weird.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.760]   Well, the British one-- the British one is easy compared to South Africa.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   British will work in that.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.760]   Yeah, it makes me and we have to fit one of these.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.760]   Both British.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:38.880]   Both British, French, Zealand, slash Australia, which is those little three prongers.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.760]   Just about everything fits into this one.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   And this-- I thought you were going to promote this power shard.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.760]   Mine has a USB port, so right there.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.760]   Yours is--
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.760]   I'm always afraid of putting USB ports in these things.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.760]   I just want to--
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.760]   Well, this is kind of just a presser, though.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.760]   No, I'm afraid of--
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.760]   It's a three-plug search suppressor.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.760]   It just scares me.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.760]   I want to put the USB thing in it.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.760]   I think I bought that in its own wall work.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.120]   I don't want to have a-- but this one-- we have lots of these.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.240]   But the big thing is, I told my wife when we were built a house, there we go.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   That's good.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   Every outlet.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   Every socket.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.240]   Because you get a lot of international visitors.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.240]   I do, actually.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.800]   By the way, I think Twitter also didn't pay their Redis bill because Twitter, apparently,
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.400]   it's just gone down.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.600]   That's a bad day for everybody in the web.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.600]   Everybody in the web.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   Everybody in the web.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   My Facebook didn't think.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600]   Twitter was Abe Vagodid.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   No, just--
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.760]   He was using a South African plug, Alex.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.760]   He is-- you know that Renee South Africa.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   I know.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.760]   You've seen those plugs.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.600]   Man, I tell you, we use them so that Americans can't come here and plug things in.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   Love itself.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   Love.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.600]   I can't use that here.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.600]   Love it.
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   Love it.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.600]   Uh, da-da-da-da-da-da.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:51.200]   Redis Labs has-- I finally tweeted, which I know is a mean-- it's kind of a mean thing
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.200]   to do.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.800]   But nobody's in the office.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.360]   So you get voicemail and I've been leaving voicemail all morning.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.600]   Well, it's not like you-- I think the big thing is that you just didn't really spend
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.920]   very much money with them.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.560]   Apparently, it's cheap.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.200]   Redis is cash, right?
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.680]   So everything else is working.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.000]   The cheapest thing is the caching, which is using Redis to cash.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.360]   And it's like 30 bucks a month.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.600]   But the credit card expired in September and I didn't know that.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.040]   And because I wasn't-- I got a lot of email from-- and it all goes in a pile of Redis
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.440]   email.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.440]   And my fault.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.720]   I'm totally my fault.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   I-- you know what?
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.400]   Totally my fault.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.600]   But yeah, literally, for 144 bucks, my whole site is down.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.080]   It's funny, Leo, but I didn't get back to Amazon for like a month.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.640]   I ordered a camera that never arrived.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.640]   No one would get back to me.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.640]   They'd always say they would.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   They never did.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.640]   I tweeted within 24 hours.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.640]   I hate to--
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   Yeah, I hate to-- that's the nuclear option.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.640]   I understand.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.640]   I win in a month, though.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   I feel like that's fair.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.640]   That's fair.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.040]   And I hate to do it.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.480]   So if you're in the chat room and you're going, where is my Twitter-- live.tv is still
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.480]   working.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   All things Twitter, Twitter.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   Twitter.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.480]   Yeah, Twitter's down.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.480]   It's a-- it's a--
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:57.480]   Twi--
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   Apocalypse.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.480]   Stupid.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   Actually, Twitter's back up.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.480]   That was apparently just a result of your message.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.400]   Yeah, it was a brief message.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.840]   I couldn't resist the joke.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.600]   Our show today brought to you by something that will keep you from ever going down with
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   your storage.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.720]   Drobo, love my Drobo.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   This is the new Drobo mini, which is super cool in so many ways.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:21.520]   This one is USB or Thunderbolt.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.600]   And it's-- you know, small enough that you could-- if you were a photographer, a videographer
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:31.080]   and you wanted a lot of high capacity, reliable, redundant storage, just two pounds, but it
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:35.640]   does have four drive bays for the smaller laptop size drive.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:40.240]   So that means you could get up to eight terabytes in there of redundant storage.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.000]   And what's great about Drobo is it's so easy.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.760]   You know, you just-- it's just-- you pop it out.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.080]   And if you're-- if-- so this is-- you can mix and match.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.720]   You guys don't have to match in Drobo's one of the things I love about them.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.880]   This drive is I think 512.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.000]   Actually, I don't see it anymore, but I think it's 512.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.080]   But let's say I need more capacity.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.240]   Even while it's running, even while I'm using it, I pop out of drive, put in a new one, it
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.520]   rebuilds, and I'm good to go.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.520]   It's so awesome.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.520]   They also make other units.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.040]   The 5D is a desktop unit.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.080]   That has space for 5, 3 1/2 inch drive.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.800]   So you get up to 64 terabytes.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.480]   This is really sweet too on the Drobo mini.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:22.160]   They have a little slot for caching SSD.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.720]   So I put 128 gig caching SSD in there.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.960]   And that really speeds small file writes up, which is really-- it's just-- there's just
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.920]   all sorts of cool features on this.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.240]   Drobo's been around for a while.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.560]   We've talked about them for years.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.720]   You know about them, I'm sure.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.720]   I just want to let you know they're getting better and better.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:43.880]   This MSATA SSD acceleration bay is just one example.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.120]   Really works great with Lightroom or Apple Photos.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.560]   The 5N is their network attached storage.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.680]   It's a media server, a file server, a backup solution.
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.640]   You just plug it into your switcher router.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.880]   Boom, you're just going.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.160]   Apps let you back up data to two different cloud service providers.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.040]   Or I love this.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.040]   They now support BitTorrent Sync.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:04.520]   Nice.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.680]   Really great.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.720]   It also works well with Plex and the new Apple TV.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:15.720]   Drobo's been advertising a Mac break weekly since, I think, the very beginning.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.440]   So we're really--
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.200]   I have lots of them.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.560]   Proud to be associated with them.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.600]   It's reliable, it's expandable, it's simple.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.960]   They're colored lights in the front of the Drobo that let you know exactly what's going
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.720]   on.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.880]   They're also just fun to look at.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.360]   It's nice to have a Drobo on your desk.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.320]   Put a Drobo on your desk.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.880]   DROB.com/twit.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.640]   And when you use a code TWIT 100, you're
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.800]   going to save $100 off the purchase of a Drobo Mini, a Drobo 4-bay, or the Drobo 5N.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.080]   What?
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.440]   100 bucks off.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.400]   Drobo.com/twit.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:53.200]   We love Drobo and we thank him so much for their continued ongoing support of Mac break
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:53.760]   weekly.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:41:02.040]   20 minutes till the first-- you think about 1/15, or Pacific 12/15?
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   What time do you think we'll get an hour and 20 minutes from our first information from Apple?
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.320]   The conference call is usually at 2 p.m. Pacific.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.320]   So the press release goes out half an hour before that.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:14.320]   OK.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.320]   So around 1/30 p.m.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:15.600]   OK.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.320]   So we've got a little time.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.920]   An hour and a half.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.120]   Still time to speculate.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.640]   A couple of betas came out.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.040]   iOS 9.3 beta 2 came out.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.920]   And today, I think OS 10 and OS 10 beta came out.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.400]   Didn't it?
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:29.760]   Where am I?
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.480]   Well, I think earlier this week, they all came out.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:31.840]   They all came out.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   They all came out.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.360]   They all came out.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:32.840]   They all came out.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.360]   They all came out.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:33.840]   They all came out.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.840]   Anything to report?
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.440]   I mean, again, it's beta stuff.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.120]   The one that was really interesting was the Apple TV.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.600]   They pushed out a pre-beta release.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.960]   So there's a general release for everybody.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.800]   You can go get it now and get the podcast app, finally, which is nice.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.480]   Yay.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.920]   That's for the TV.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.840]   But that-- OK.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.920]   It's pre-beta.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.520]   What does that mean?
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.120]   So they put out the new beta or the Apple TV,
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.040]   but they also put out a release version of one--
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.480]   I think it's 9.1.1.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.760]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.960]   So you don't have to wait for the beta.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.880]   You can go get that now and you'll
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.600]   get the podcast app immediately.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.600]   That came out yesterday.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.040]   So get it.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.400]   Install it.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.680]   You can watch all of us at Macbek Weekly
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.920]   right from the official app.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.760]   There are now a lot of ways to watch.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.920]   You could be there four total, I think,
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.480]   Twitter apps on the Apple TV thank you to our fans who've
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.800]   written those and done such a great job.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.000]   The only big advantage to the official client
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.320]   is that if you subscribe and iTunes on your computer,
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   it'll sync your status and everything in between.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.560]   Well, Patrick just told me there's now five apps.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.560]   Plus the podcast app.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.920]   There's six so many options.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:29.720]   I love it.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.400]   See, we've been begging you for an app store for so long.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.720]   It was pent up demand.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.320]   Well, I think this is going to be a great little--
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.840]   I mean, now with the US support for Bluetooth keyboards,
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:43.240]   I mean, you end up with this kind of lightweight computer
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.440]   for a lot of folks.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.920]   And as these apps start to proliferate,
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.960]   I have to admit, I go up to the app store probably almost
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.000]   every day to see what's new, what's new that you could do.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.640]   And then someone's figured out to do with the Apple TV.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.560]   I have some good news.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.600]   I finally broke down in order to case for my 12-inch MacBook.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.840]   So that means there'll probably be a new one any minute.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.440]   Large.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:03.880]   You think--
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.800]   I probably will be.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.880]   Yeah, but this guy like--
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.360]   I mean, I thought I was hoping this guy like
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.880]   M would be much better than the current Broadwell M
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.560]   and doesn't look like it's going to be.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.680]   Boy, Microsoft is having a hell of a time with the Skylike.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:22.600]   They're Surface Pro and my Surface Book.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.200]   The power settings and stuff just are broken as hell.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.400]   They call it the hot pothoracos of the hot bag syndrome,
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.680]   where you sleep it, you close it, you put it in your bag,
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.040]   and you take it out an hour later, the battery's dead,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:36.840]   and the--
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:37.680]   It didn't turn off.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.200]   Shut down.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.040]   The laptop's really hot.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.040]   And all of this, Microsoft's blaming on Skylike.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.600]   They're saying it's a difficult computer science problem.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.400]   It has nothing to do with the Patriots.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.280]   Sounds like a freshman in computer 101.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.880]   I guess it depends on--
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.720]   Apple's the Skylake, I think, on Apple
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.280]   is still restricted to the iMac 27-inch.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.040]   I don't think they've put it in anything else yet.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.360]   So we'll see when they go to Skylake with the rest.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.000]   But I mean, the dirty secret in the chip business now
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.600]   is they're all pretty much the same.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.720]   Intel's advantage, much like Microsoft's advantage in mobile
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.400]   is evaporated.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.880]   Samsung's gotten really good.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.360]   Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.000]   has gotten really good.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.320]   They're all in these processes now.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.480]   Qualcomm feels like they're falling behind, especially in IP.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.040]   It feels like Apple is doing better.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.200]   ARM IP, then Qualcomm is now, which, if you told anyone
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.880]   that five years ago, they think you're out of your mind.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.080]   But it really is a different world now.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.840]   And Intel just can't be taken for granted
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.360]   to be making good chips anymore.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.560]   They have to earn it, like everybody else.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:34.560]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:43.640]   So those chips may appear in a 5SE as well.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.360]   So March, you sounds like we do think there's
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.440]   going to be a March announcement.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.280]   And one of the things Mark Gurman saying
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   is the iPhone 5SE will be announced then--
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.560]   we've known this for a while.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.360]   This will be a 4-inch.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.720]   But the thing that's interesting is he says,
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.920]   likely to have the A9 and M9 chips.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.560]   And his logic makes sense, which is--
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.080]   this is going to be the low end of the Apple line.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.200]   But you wanted to have the same capabilities as an iPhone.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.560]   And will it have the fingerprint reader?
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.600]   So it allows the Apple band--
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.840]   And the H.L.O.M.O. always on H.L.O.M.O.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.080]   Well, so that's the big thing.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.960]   It's such a small screen that they don't really
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.560]   need to push around that many pixels, which
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.120]   is the big problem on the iPhone 6 Plus.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.040]   It's almost a iPad size pixels they're pushing around.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.560]   But for this, what the A9 does is it
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.640]   allows-- is a better image processor for the cameras,
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.640]   which is nice, but it enables H.C.E.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.920]   because the processor is integrated into the die.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.440]   So it allows for much better efficiency.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:44.480]   And do we expect the same resolution on the camera?
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.200]   So whether they go with a 12 megapixel
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.960]   like the iPhone 6S, probably not.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.240]   I mean, for Apple, there's two things
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.160]   that people think of when they think of the smaller screen.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.400]   There are some people who just want a smaller screen.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.160]   That way, their thumb can reach all the way across,
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.360]   where it fits in their pocket better, or whatever the reason.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.760]   They just really want an iPhone with a smaller screen.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.680]   But other people equate small with being less expensive.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.720]   And that's kind of weird if you grew up in electronics,
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.080]   where miniaturization was always super expensive.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.720]   But if the iPhone 6 Plus is 100 bucks more,
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.200]   people think, oh, the iPhone 6 minus is going to be 100 bucks
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.320]   cheaper.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.320]   So there is something to be said for component cost control.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.960]   And getting Apple to make A9 chips becomes cheaper the more
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.800]   that they make.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.640]   And using the Canberra family from an iPhone 6
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.200]   instead of an iPhone 6S is still cheaper
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.520]   from a component standpoint for them.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.800]   And I think it'd be fine.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.160]   I mean, I would love to have a cheaper option for buying,
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.680]   for instance, lots of them for a company or for my kids.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.480]   I just bought them for my--
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.520]   I just bought two for my kids, my older kids.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.200]   And they were very expensive.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.400]   When all came down, I was like, it would be really nice
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.000]   if they had a cheaper version of it,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.040]   especially if you buy them outside of a plan.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.040]   You get kind of the real cost of these phones.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.920]   So I think that definitely seeing something in the $600, $700
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.920]   range or without a plan would be--
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.840]   I think it's $450, I think, as a spot it takes.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.720]   Because it'll replace the 5S, the 5S,
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.520]   the prime out.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.880]   And they don't want to move the 6 down.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.400]   Because then you have-- well, everything
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.280]   looks like an iPhone 6.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.600]   And there's 4.7 and 5.5.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.320]   There's no 4-inch option anymore.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.200]   And all marketing is about controlling perceptions.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.520]   You have the cheap phone that gets everyone in the door,
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.440]   the medium phone that almost everyone buys,
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.960]   and the expensive phone that people who are obsessed
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.440]   with premium stuff buy.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.480]   And usually you want to sort of manage margins
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.160]   so that as many people as possible fall
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.320]   into the middle bucket.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.040]   And part of doing that is having that sort of in-the-door
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.440]   introductory model being at the lower price point,
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.560]   but having lower specs that will turn off your premium buyers.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.240]   And I have to admit, I'm pretty happy with the S,
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.080]   the S, not the plus.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.800]   I mean, I had the plus on the first one.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.400]   It came out thinking I tried the bigger one,
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.360]   but I went back to the smaller one and just more convenient.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.480]   It's in more of my pockets.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.080]   I think that's the issue.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.600]   Given that I wrap it with basically a wallet,
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:58.560]   I realized I'm actually become the Merlin man guy.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.280]   You're talking to my wallet.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.760]   I like-- and I think it was you who told me about this,
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.720]   Renee, the Just Press Record.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.520]   I really like that.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.280]   I can do this voice memos on my watch now.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.600]   It is awesome.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.720]   So awesome.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.160]   Yeah, no, it's absolutely terrific.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.440]   Anytime you have an idea, that's why I like the whole moving
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.720]   into Siri and notes and just press record,
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.520]   because you're driving or you're busy,
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.680]   and you just have this great idea,
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.760]   and you know that you're holding up,
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.600]   that you're going to forget it,
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.520]   and you forget that you haven't had an idea,
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.880]   and being able to record it any time, in any place,
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.760]   it just-- it lets you relax and not worry about
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.240]   remembering everything.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.960]   Right.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.000]   It's phenomenally good stuff.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Phenomenal.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.240]   Yeah, I'm excited for that, Phil.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.400]   And as much as I find small screens claustrophobic now,
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.440]   because the human brain is remarkable at adjusting.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.520]   So the minute you get something big,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.880]   everything else looks small.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:47.760]   The minute you get something smaller,
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.560]   the thing else looks big.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.040]   But there are a lot of people who really love
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.880]   that small screen size, and it's nice that Apple's going
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.600]   to be not only maintaining it, but having
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.160]   a newer version of it.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.640]   I do like being able to type with one hand.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.160]   Like being able to hold the iPhone,
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.880]   which I just can't do with the big--
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.680]   my hands are not big enough for a 6S+ to actually--
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.440]   And it's the weight.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.240]   I mean, because 6 Plus is not just the size, it's the balance.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.000]   You hold it at the bottom to type with one hand,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.120]   and suddenly it's super heavy.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.720]   And it sounds silly because it's such a small thing,
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.480]   but trying to walk and type and drink coffee
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.560]   at the same time, that weight makes a huge difference.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.160]   I do think it's important to have all the phones out there
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.600]   supporting Apple Pay because I think that's going to be a big push.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.400]   Although the thing I'm most excited about with Apple Pay
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.160]   is the web--
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.760]   being able to pay over the web with Apple Pay.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.640]   And send payments would be nice when they introduce that.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.200]   It would be awesome.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.240]   They could send down 10 bucks.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.440]   Yeah, really quickly.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.480]   I think peer-to-peer is great.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.800]   I think the big thing for me is that I
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.880]   realize how many times I walk away from a site because I'm like,
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.840]   oh, I don't want to do--
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.240]   I don't want to put all my billing stuff back in again.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.160]   I don't want to deal with that again.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.720]   It's why I buy so much stuff from B&H in Amazon
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.120]   is because those are my two sites that I've
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.960]   kind of stopped buying anything important--
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.680]   video, audio-video related from Amazon
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.800]   because I don't know where it's going to show up in my yard.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.480]   But for the general stuff that I don't care about being
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.000]   rained on after on track, not after on track,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.800]   leaves it somewhere in the vicinity of my house,
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   like within the same block of my house,
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.480]   that when that's OK, then I order it there.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.040]   But I noticed that I go to other sites
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.320]   and I really want to see if it's on Amazon or B&H
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.040]   because I don't really want to deal with a new thing.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.680]   I think that-- I know Google Wallet does that,
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.520]   but I think that Apple might be able to expand
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.080]   to the Apple users to be able to do that easily.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.280]   And it's way better because I don't
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.960]   want to trust all these different sites
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.560]   in my credit card information because invariably they
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.560]   get compromised and then my credit card has to--
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.640]   and with Apple, they're just giving a one-time use token.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:37.120]   So even if that site does get compromised, it's going to allow you.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.280]   I just saw what happened with my Bank of America card.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.720]   They quietly just said, we're going to send you a new card.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:43.600]   There was a compromise.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.360]   And then they just sent me a new card.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.640]   And they just turned my card off.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.200]   I was in Africa.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.360]   And they just turned my card off.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.480]   My card just stopped working as an emergency procedure.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.200]   And it turned out I didn't think it was Hilton or hi.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.240]   I'd got hacked.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:59.080]   And I just think that the future is definitely one-time access.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:50:59.520]   So--
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.000]   There was a great article, Craig Hockenberry,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.280]   from the icon factory that people make
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.880]   Twitterific wrote an article for us
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.920]   because he was away on vacation and his card was compromised.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:08.480]   And then you went just appeared on Apple Pay.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.880]   He didn't have to wait for the physical card to arrive.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.040]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:12.640]   It was terrific.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.560]   He didn't lose anything.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.760]   He was able to pay for anything he needed.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.120]   Oh, that's really good.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.920]   That would have kept our website up.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.960]   Next time I'm using Apple Pay, I'm not interested.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.160]   And I still think-- when we talk about growth,
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.200]   I mean, I know I sounded crazy when
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.560]   I talked about cars five years ago
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.880]   that Apple should be getting into cars.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.520]   And I still think that Apple Pay, the end result,
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.240]   somewhere down the road five, 10 years from now,
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:40.120]   is an Apple Bank, where Apple does say,
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.440]   Apple only serves you to see its own loans for its own products,
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.960]   would be a good business.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.360]   Just simply, an Apple Pay puts them
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.960]   between the consumer and the banks.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.560]   I hate that idea.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.240]   But I think that that's--
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.000]   I just feel like--
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.240]   I think it's the obvious.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.400]   Because there's a lot of people.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.440]   I mean, I hate to say it.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.640]   I drop B&A and be a bank.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.080]   Pretty soon you're going to have an Apple car.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.200]   You're going to have an Apple credit card, Apple counts,
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.120]   Apple--
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.680]   And you know what?
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.760]   They'll all work well.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.320]   Be a marshmallow world.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.440]   I shouldn't say that.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.680]   They'll all work well together.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.320]   They'll all just kind of like everything
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.680]   will sink, everything will work.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.400]   There's a lot of people that just don't care about--
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.560]   You know who wants to make it a Microsoft world?
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.240]   Microsoft.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:24.080]   They just launched today a Bing powered News app for iOS.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.360]   News Pro.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.840]   That now-- and they have their--
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.040]   I don't know why anybody would want this,
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.520]   but they have the keyboard app for Windows Phone.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.400]   Is that all I thought?
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.640]   I thought it was like, wow, that looks really weird.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.000]   I don't want that.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   No idea why anybody would love that.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.560]   Even if you love the Windows keyboard,
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.280]   Apple is still not great on third-party keyboards.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.240]   Well, that's why I stopped.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.000]   I went right there eventually because it switches
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.120]   in secure situations.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.760]   They wanted you to use the Apple keyboard.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.920]   It's just too confusing.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.760]   As much as I hate the Apple keyboard,
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.720]   I don't use a third-party keyboard on iOS.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.920]   Because that's one of the reasons I do have to say,
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.520]   I love an iPad Pro with a keyboard.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.360]   Because using that keyboard on iOS is awesome.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.560]   Well, they also brought back the keyboard to Apple TV,
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.920]   which is super interesting now because people
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.160]   are looking into whether they can apply keyboards to games
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.640]   the way they do on a PC.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.280]   And it's not clear yet because I think in the official SDK,
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.400]   it only takes key down and not key up.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.680]   And that makes a difference in gaming.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.800]   But you fast forward a year or two.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:21.040]   Once you start having a real sort of computer
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:24.000]   or computer on in front of your TV, that's still easy to use,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.720]   it sort of opens up a lot of possibilities.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.040]   So I don't see News Pro.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:28.920]   I'm trying to download.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.880]   Have you been able to download it on a Renee or--
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.440]   No.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.360]   Oh, here it is.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.240]   News Pro, your work news-- it's not an iPad app.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.960]   It's a iPhone app.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.280]   All right, well, I'll install in the iPad, which will give us
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:41.800]   a giant--
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.720]   Everybody's trying to get it.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.320]   I mean, when you look at Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook,
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.240]   trying to basically get into the news businesses,
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.440]   definitely become the business.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.600]   And Google, too, with Facebook, with Facebook's news,
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.720]   Apple with Apple news--
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.080]   Although--
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.040]   Actually, Microsoft's a little late to the game on this.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.880]   News Pro, hyper-relevant news for your work.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.360]   Personalized--
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.200]   Apple's a little bit hindered by their culture
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.000]   because they kept all the new stuff so secret that the minus
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.040]   one, Home Search page, doesn't know about news.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.960]   And no, but not even-- just in development.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.000]   Like, the people didn't know that Apple was making a news app.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.360]   So when you go to the Siri page, you get news that's not
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.160]   from the News app.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.000]   It's just sort of random.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.800]   And then you go to Safari and you're reading--
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.160]   none of this stuff works together.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.960]   And that's the one thing that's hard for Apple,
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.120]   is to get past traditional secrecy and make a product that just--
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.160]   news should be an operating system level service.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.640]   I should be able to go anywhere.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.920]   I follow you on Twitter, Leo.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.920]   You recommend an article that should show up in news for me.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:33.400]   I agree.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.240]   If I save an article to the reading list,
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.280]   that should show up in the News app for me.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.800]   I shouldn't have these little silos on iOS.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.680]   Well, that's why I like Nuzzle.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.880]   For instance, Nuzzle is a good example of a news app
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.680]   that uses social signals and does a good job.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.840]   This is clearly-- Microsoft's product is clearly aimed
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:51.880]   at business very much so.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.480]   I'm so hooked to Flipboard.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.080]   And I'm just going to run time looking better.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.080]   Kind of interesting that the first story is Lenovo.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.920]   I was thinking second.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.760]   So let's see if somebody asks me to stop babbling.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.200]   Stop babbling.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.200]   OK.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:04.720]   It's just a--
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.520]   You thought we weren't listening to you?
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.520]   No, no.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.920]   It's just-- I've been trying to participate for the past 10
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.440]   minutes.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.440]   Was Andy muted?
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:13.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.560]   I didn't know exactly.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.040]   It wasn't me getting more and more irchives more.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:17.360]   OK.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.800]   At this point, either they're extremely rude
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.040]   or something's been muted at my end or theirs.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:22.720]   I apologize.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.400]   And unfortunately, the chat didn't work on this side.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.840]   So I couldn't just ping Jason to ask if--
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.440]   Jason, was he muted or did we do something?
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:32.880]   OK.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.760]   Well, anyway, you're on.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.400]   Go.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.360]   OK.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.080]   I've completely forgotten.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.080]   I've nothing to say.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.640]   I'm so long ago.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.040]   I'm serious.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.200]   I'm so sorry, Andy.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:49.160]   All I intended to say about the new iPhone 5 is that at least
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.840]   it's a really important thing for them to make this
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.760]   and not make it into we're just going
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.120]   to repackage the old phone with the old technology.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.040]   We're going to give you an old crappy phone
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.640]   because it's not just about--
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.920]   it really is about embracing the diversity of the users.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.400]   And for a lot of people, they just
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:07.040]   can't integrate even the modern equivalent
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.480]   of a standard-sized phone with their lifestyles
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.560]   or their wardrobes.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.040]   So if they're making a smaller or classic-sized phone,
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.720]   that can fit into clutch purses, that can fit into little pockets,
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.080]   that can be used well with smaller hands.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.640]   And it's a really, really great thing
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.240]   that they're giving it the modern processor,
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.920]   that they're giving it--
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.080]   they're giving it Apple Pay, they're giving it Touch ID.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.400]   It shouldn't be a second class.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.160]   It isn't, shouldn't it?
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:31.680]   Exactly.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.800]   It's a first-class phone.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.800]   And also, they really need to make the statement
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.440]   that the iPhone isn't just individual models,
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.040]   that it's a suite of features that's
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.440]   consistent across all devices.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.920]   So it would make a lot of people feel
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.240]   minest if they didn't have the ability to do Touch ID,
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:51.480]   for instance, but anybody who buys a larger phone could.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:55.080]   All right, the Heroku Dinos have been restarted.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:59.200]   Yeah, those things get expensive.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:56:59.840]   You turn modern.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.560]   The internet is-- and Twit.tv is back up.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.120]   Thank god.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.600]   OK, so I apologize.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:10.120]   Our long national nightmare, my personal nightmare is over.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.840]   I'm getting a lot of treats now.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.280]   Are you stupid?
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.520]   Yeah, I'm stupid.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.400]   I'm stupid.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.480]   It was a dumb thing to do.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.960]   I had it on a credit card, which got either terminated
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.760]   or expired.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.840]   And I didn't notice it.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.760]   It's back in September.
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.960]   And they did send me support notices
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.920]   saying, hey, update your information as one would do.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.720]   But it comes with a bunch of other notices.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.960]   Your stuff's happening.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.480]   So I have a folder that all gets filtered into,
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.520]   and I didn't look and foolish me.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.720]   And then the problem was when the site went down this morning,
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.120]   I couldn't log in.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.800]   It was like the count no longer existed.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.360]   I guess they were mad at me.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.400]   So we've paid our 144 dollars.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.440]   I bet you that won't happen again.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.840]   For many reasons, on both sides.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.840]   Well, yeah.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.520]   I mean, yeah.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.520]   You know what?
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.120]   It's a small company.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.680]   It's a minor service.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.200]   But it's a single point of failure.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:08.040]   And just a good thing to be aware of.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.120]   So we're back up.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.480]   We've restarted the dynos.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.720]   I love it that we have to do that.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.080]   I don't even know what it means.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.120]   So I actually know a lot about dynos.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:15.960]   Because of Heroku?
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:19.880]   Yeah, we built a Hazeu originally on Heroku, Heroku.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.320]   We moved to Firebase.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:24.200]   It's what they call their unit of computing power.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.400]   Well, and then you can get these super dynos that are--
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.680]   40 times more powerful than the regular one.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.000]   But they're really expensive to run.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.720]   So you have to kind of keep track of what you're doing.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.600]   We accidentally burned up a couple thousand dollars in a day.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.840]   Well, yeah.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.520]   I guess it's what all those emails are.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:42.600]   You're a dynoser.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.240]   I should start--
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.040]   I should start having too many operations.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.560]   And the impact.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.200]   But yeah.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.680]   [SIGHS]
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.280]   Yes, we're back up.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.400]   It's so good.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:55.160]   Thank you, everybody, for your patience.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.000]   And yes, it's my fault, and I am stupid.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:04.040]   News Pro, does anybody want to use that Microsoft keyboard?
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:04.840]   As silly looking as--
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.360]   Yes.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.040]   I think that--
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:11.000]   I mean, if Apple had a keyboard system that
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.120]   made it reliable to use third-party keyboards,
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.640]   they don't have to take over the whole market.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.480]   They just have to create something that's useful.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.320]   And as we've just been saying, there are a lot of people
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.280]   for whom they would love to have an alternative keyboard that
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.960]   could be operated one-handed because of these bigger,
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.720]   bigger phones.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.120]   It's not about creating something that displaces something else.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:33.080]   It's about making up richer and more flexible experience.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.680]   Again, it just reminds me that I--
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.200]   replaceable keyboards was one of the things
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.280]   that I was really whining about missing from iOS.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.400]   And when it came, it's like, oh, OK,
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.720]   I should have been more specific.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:46.320]   It's--
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.960]   It's nice to be able to visually see a different keyboard.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.760]   I would like it so that it works so well.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:52.920]   And so in such a stable way, that won't just go back
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.200]   to the old one.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.440]   It's amazing if you do a search on the App Store for Microsoft.
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.480]   How many apps they make now?
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.680]   It's a full-court press.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.680]   Everyone makes apps.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.920]   It's one of the advantages of iOS
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.520]   is you can get apps from every other company.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:06.860]   Yep.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.520]   That is true.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.120]   That is really true.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.960]   And this is what-- this is the great thing that happens
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.840]   when a company decides that we are going to try to support
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.960]   as many users as possible.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.200]   You cast the widest net as you can.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.200]   Well, and I think--
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.200]   I think it's the irony, of course.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.000]   I think they've given up on their own OS.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.440]   I mean, I think that that's--
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.040]   I don't think that's true.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.440]   I think they acknowledge that the '90s and the early 2000s
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.720]   are definitely over.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.760]   I don't mean windows.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.360]   I mean, the Windows phone.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:32.960]   You know, I don't--
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.400]   It's never going to get off the ground.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.760]   They would agree with that because they would say
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.960]   that there is no more Windows phone.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.640]   There's just Windows 10.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.360]   I think it's going to be a long time before--
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.760]   their biggest problem is that they're
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:46.240]   having almost no success whatsoever,
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.040]   getting developers excited about making apps that
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.200]   are targeting phones.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.640]   All the real action is still happening inside the desktop
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.680]   style apps.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.680]   So Surface Pro 4 is a wonderful tablet.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.160]   I mean, without any reservation.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.840]   But it still mostly shines when you're running it
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.440]   as a Windows desktop sort of device that
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.720]   has a little bit of extra flexibility.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.520]   It's still kind of embarrassing that you can't get--
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.280]   you can't get the sort of desktop class apps for the iPad
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.240]   Pro that you can for Windows Surface Pro.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.160]   But you also can't get the sort of apps that really
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.880]   leverage the strength of having a tablet with a really
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.440]   good pencil as you can with the iPad Pro.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.400]   So let's see.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.920]   Just looking through the rundown.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:37.320]   Apple has it-- is maybe?
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.080]   I don't know.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:38.880]   You tell me.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.200]   Can we trust it?
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:45.040]   Leaked iPad Air 3 design pointing to four speakers
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.040]   in LED flash.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.920]   This comes from a site I'm not familiar with the iDownload
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.120]   blog.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:50.920]   Actually, I'm sorry.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.000]   They're republishing a French blog, nowhere else.fr.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.320]   Yeah, there's a lot of sites that get stuff from China
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.040]   and then republish it for English speakers.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.520]   And sometimes it is accurate because a lot of stuff
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.880]   leaks out of the Chinese manufacturing and supply chain.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.360]   On pretend you pronounce schematique, the lippad.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.400]   How do you say iPad in French?
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.240]   lippad?
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:10.720]   iPad.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.240]   We have--
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:16.080]   iPad, lipad, set on wheat.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.440]   That's all I know.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.320]   That's all I know.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.720]   Cheese.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.400]   Now, the four speakers make sense because there's
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.440]   four speakers on the iPad Pro.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.600]   Sort of, but the iPad Pro has such a--
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.840]   the thing with the iPad Pro is that it's so big.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.400]   And you can't fill it with battery
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.640]   because the battery adds weight, but also it becomes illegal
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.640]   to ship it that has too high a density.
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.480]   Oh, interesting.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.440]   Lithium ion battery regulations are voluminous
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.000]   and highly restrictive.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.360]   So Apple had the opportunity to put these huge cavernous
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.560]   speakers in there.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.600]   So the iPad Pro is much more constrained by size.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.720]   So they can put a bigger, relatively bigger battery in there.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.820]   So whether these are going to be the full on giant,
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.960]   concussive speakers of the iPad Pro, hard to tell.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.960]   They might just be four smaller sort of speakers
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.840]   in the same position.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.520]   Who was that?
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.800]   Was it a Kickstarter project that couldn't be shipped
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:08.840]   because there was a blinking blue light on the product?
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.000]   And the company thought it was on.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.920]   The DHL, or whoever was shimming it,
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.840]   or from China, thought it was on.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.960]   And of course, with lithium ion batteries,
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.720]   they didn't want to take the chance.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.840]   And somebody had a go-over and say, no, no, that means it's
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.760]   just low power.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.560]   They said, no, no, no.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.320]   It's just a hoverboard.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:26.840]   It's fine.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.340]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.840]   That's a funny thing because a bunch of viewers said,
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.600]   why don't they just fill the whole thing with battery?
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.120]   Well, it would be technically illegal to ship it
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:32.440]   to customers.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.280]   Isn't that fascinating?
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.920]   I had no idea.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.480]   More than that, but why could you chip a laptop with that kind?
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.080]   Yeah, it's not just the size of the battery,
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.040]   but it's the way the cells are created inside those batteries.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.920]   And there's things you could do to sort of futz with that.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.240]   But those are the sort of things Apple doesn't an iPad.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.080]   Should people-- just your advice on the betas that
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.640]   came out yesterday, should people
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.320]   update to their watch to beta 2?
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.160]   It's probably not worth it.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.480]   So the watch, no, because the watch is not even
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.120]   a public beta for it.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.080]   Oh, OK.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.360]   There is new maps and there's the ability to sync to watches.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.960]   But you have to install a certificate.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.000]   It's still a process.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.320]   It's not really a whole person friendly.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.000]   For iPhone and iPad, still, I think
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.200]   the last beta Apple Pencil wasn't working properly
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.280]   on the iPad Pro.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.440]   So if you really depend on the Apple Pencil,
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.880]   then why risk it just to get a few beta?
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.360]   And they're really nice education features and stuff.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.000]   But if you don't absolutely need it and you don't have a spare,
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.640]   it's always wise to wait and see what happens to other people
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.800]   first.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.040]   It's generally a no for me if you're
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.040]   thinking about running a data search.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.680]   That's often why I might have a loaner from Apple that
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.840]   goes for five or six months.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.640]   But I will still buy one of my own
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.280]   because I want to check betas on something.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.080]   And I really have--
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.480]   if it's something that I need to have a stable platform for,
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.280]   and I'm not going to want it from my library anyway,
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:55.680]   it's like, yeah, don't try anything on a beta.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.960]   This is going to be reliable.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.360]   Certainly nothing that-- if it were my primary device,
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.640]   no way in hell.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.520]   Fire at the Tesla plant, fire at the FoxCon plant
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.360]   where the iPhone is made.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.720]   Wow.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.400]   Two floors engulfed in flames.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:09.960]   That's not good.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.720]   Is it still going?
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.200]   No, that's not good.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.720]   No, this is old.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.560]   This is from People's Daily.
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.240]   I think it worked out.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.160]   It was the air conditioning shaft or something like that.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:17.920]   Yeah, unclear.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.800]   I mean, it's not the first time.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:24.720]   There have been explosions and fires in the past.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   According to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.520]   there was one in 2011 at the iPad 2 production factory.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.120]   Three workers were killed, 15 injured.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.680]   And that really slowed down iPad production.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.640]   Not sure how this will impact iPhone production.
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.120]   That was last night at the FoxCon plant.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.040]   I wouldn't be surprised if they addressed that
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.920]   in the call today.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.960]   Fire is always worse than no fire.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.600]   There's so many great things that, also last week,
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.720]   news from one of the Fairloom in those lawsuits
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.440]   has been leaked out about the relationship
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.240]   that Apple has with Google and how much Google has--
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.320]   maybe has paid to Apple for the ability
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.440]   to have Google search as the iPhone's default iOS's default
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.240]   search engine.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.360]   And that payment being somewhere in the range
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.440]   of about a billion dollars.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:16.560]   And also with a split of revenue, that is $65.35.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.520]   Although it was a vague thing that didn't know
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.720]   who got the larger end of that thing.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.920]   It's interesting about how much people--
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.880]   people inside Apple are preparing for any questions
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.200]   that might come in about things they can't talk about,
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.320]   but they need to address it.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.280]   And also, as we said before, this is one of the few times
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.600]   where they're making statements in public
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.840]   where if they say something that is not 100% Teflon correct,
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.320]   it's another new lawsuit.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.080]   So it'll be interesting to see how they address people who
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.560]   might talk about a fire at the Foxconn plan, who
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.160]   might talk about rumors about things that are happening
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:55.640]   with Apple car rumors about these deals
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.640]   that they have with Google.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.680]   Interesting enough, both Google and Apple
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.120]   both tried to have that part of the testimony sealed.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.160]   So it wasn't just Google trying to--
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.000]   for Google's part of the testimony,
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.120]   they said that that number is never meant to go out,
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   and it's not a real number anyway.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.800]   But it's just an example of the sort of thing
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.640]   where if you're going to be on that stage and on that call,
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.360]   you've got to be ready for pretty much anything
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.880]   that Amy's going to ask you about anything.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.840]   Project Titan at a crossroads according to Apple Insider.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.320]   And this is from their-- what they say previously--
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.800]   What if they were the actual car?
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.920]   That looks like a Remington razor
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.280]   that they glued wheels on.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.960]   They do admit, Apple-- artists pour rendering
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.280]   of an Apple garage.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.640]   That's an East German.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:47.520]   This is Travant.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:48.640]   It looks like a blue jamb--
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.480]   This is the Travant as our model.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.080]   That's the voxel from Conchier.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.520]   Yeah, Travoxel.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.720]   The char-- this is from a previously reliable source
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.320]   with knowledge of the team's activities
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.880]   according to Apple Insider.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:05.040]   Johnny Ive, in a post holiday progress review,
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.920]   was expressed his displeasure, shall we say,
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.440]   with the group's headway.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.080]   And there is now a hiring freeze on the team responsible.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:17.600]   We know that about 1,000 people are working on Project Titan,
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.360]   a Apple car project.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.240]   In fact, hiring was so aggressive
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.360]   that Apple's poaching of talent from Tesla
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.920]   has been cited as an impact on Tesla production.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.440]   Right.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.040]   Elon Musk's response to that was the only engineers
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.920]   who were losing to Apple are the crappy ones.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:36.920]   Sourcraves.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.760]   One more story we hired to begin with.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.240]   We didn't want them anyway.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.720]   But they were a big mistake.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.800]   Go to that Apple.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.480]   We don't care.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.400]   Jerky jerks jerks.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.600]   Let me show you my new spaceship that were landing
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.000]   on a robotic large in the ocean.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.720]   Yes, pay no attention to that.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.040]   No one else has done that except for the planet.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.240]   Let's talk about it.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.440]   I love that fight is great.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:01.800]   Yes.
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.120]   The Bezos Musk fight.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.320]   We all benefit.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.080]   Which I hope there's a little bit of a slip,
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:14.320]   because remember when SpaceX did their launch
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.840]   or their first reusable landing,
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.160]   wasn't it a blue origin?
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.120]   Welcome to the club.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.800]   We did that two weeks ago.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.320]   It's great.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.000]   It's like a space race without tax money.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:26.520]   Right.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.000]   Exactly.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.400]   You have to see in words.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.720]   Isn't it better that they're spending it on spaceships
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.960]   rather than big sailboat sailboats?
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.720]   That's what they used to battle over now.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.280]   They still do.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.320]   They still do.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:38.840]   They still do.
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.120]   Oh, they got enough money for the spaceship and the yacht.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.120]   Yes.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:42.520]   I know.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:42.600]   But--
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.640]   Well, an Apple has enough money for 1,000 engineers
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.600]   to work on a car on spec.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.280]   That theoretically doesn't exist.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:48.600]   Right.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.800]   I mean, just like, well, let's see.
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.800]   Let's just try it.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.320]   See what happens.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.040]   Why not?
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.760]   I was thinking about that last week
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.000]   when a lot of these rumors were first coming out that it
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.800]   must be kind of disheartening that a lot of people
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.120]   would come to Apple to work in this project
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.720]   because they know that even if there's a pay cut involved,
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.360]   even if they don't have the same stature they might
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.200]   have had at a motor company, this
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.960]   is something that's genuinely exciting,
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.080]   that just like every electronic engineer or many of them
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.560]   would have loved to have been a part of the team that
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.160]   built the first Macintosh.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.120]   These are people who are living a dream of doing something
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.600]   that's going to be historically important.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.880]   But nonetheless, this is still an unannounced product.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.960]   This is still unofficial.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.600]   At any point, Apple can decide that this was a dead end
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.600]   and they need to really put all those resources into VR.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.760]   And suddenly, they are the chief engineer of a project
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.400]   that never existed that they still can never talk about.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.320]   It's great for personal growth, but it
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.000]   must be a little bit disheartened.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.920]   Your project could be sent into the wish
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.360]   into the cornfield at any moment.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.680]   And the best part is I don't think
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.480]   that they're taking a pay cut.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.400]   Yeah, oh no.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:47.960]   I think Apple--
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.400]   I think Apple is--
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.040]   I think Apple-- my guess is Apple is paying whatever
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.800]   they need to pay to bring the right engineers in to what
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.640]   they're ruthlessly poaching, whoever they think
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   is worth having for the surprise.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.800]   So the average salary is what?
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.280]   $100,000?
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.160]   $250 million a year?
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.160]   That's doable.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.320]   I bet you think we can work with the recent--
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.320]   Well, average salary.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.800]   Some people are going to make less.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.320]   Not many.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.320]   Not in the engineering.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.480]   That's the one I bet you.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.360]   They're $150,200 to $100 million.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.800]   So say you spend $1/2 billion to $1 billion a year?
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.680]   That's a lot of money.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.400]   We can quickly look at recent history, though.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.080]   If you look at the iPhone, Project Purple,
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.800]   that started off as a tablet project.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.280]   And then they didn't think they could make it tablets.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.240]   They started making a phone.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.600]   But all those technologies and a lot of those--
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.160]   that project was almost identical.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.760]   It just ended up having a different interim application.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.120]   And then pretty soon after that, they went back to making
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.080]   the iPad.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.080]   And all the technologies-- this is why this story is quasi-efficient
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.280]   in me.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.600]   Because just like Purple wasn't just a phone, Purple was also
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.680]   iOS, which ends up being a major component for Apple's future.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.200]   It wasn't just the hardware and the atoms
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.520]   that the designers were putting together.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.520]   And my guess is that Project Titan is similar,
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.640]   that yes, there's all these people from Tesla
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.480]   and other car people.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.560]   But there's also all sorts of other things going on.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.080]   Because an Apple car wouldn't just be a Ford car.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.120]   It would be a computer on wheels the way the phone is
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.480]   a computer that makes calls.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.760]   And that's what the Tesla is, really.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.260]   Right.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:04.080]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.760]   But what does a hiring freeze mean?
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.520]   Because Apple is still working on bits all the time.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.600]   So the whole thing is maybe there's
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.040]   certain parts of it that they're changing.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.320]   Well, also the guy overseeing the project apparently left.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.640]   And I used to have a hiring freeze.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.240]   Is to make sure that whoever the new guy is,
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.120]   is the guy who's making the choices of who he's
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.520]   bringing into his engineering.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.960]   He's a 16-year Apple veteran.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.440]   He's still there, but he's told people
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.760]   he's leaving for personal reasons.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.880]   And again, that's one person.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.400]   It's like Jeff Williams ran Apple Watch.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.200]   But there was also Kevin Lynch running the software.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.680]   And there was another guy running the hard.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.000]   There are multiple people who are running that project.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.120]   And not all of them have left.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.960]   And all of them still have teams that are highly functional.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.240]   Apple's such an interesting company
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.400]   that this is one of those companies where if I--
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.760]   if I know that they have a project that's this big,
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.880]   and there's a fact that one of the most prominent people
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.240]   on that team has left, and the rumor that is there's
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.280]   a hiring freeze, that another company
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.480]   that would make me think that, OK, maybe this
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.080]   is not going to move forward.
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.560]   With Apple, you really do have to consider
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.600]   that they had their research into both the technology
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.120]   they're developing and where they want this to be
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.920]   in relationship to the Apple of 2025,
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.920]   is that they wound up someplace they didn't expect
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.560]   they're going to go.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.680]   And they realized that they don't have the right people
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.080]   and they don't have the right plan.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.960]   So it's still moving forward only.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.880]   They decide that they want to make a spaceship
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.080]   instead of a high altitude airplane, for instance.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.520]   I mean, Renee is absolutely right.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.360]   I mean, that's one of the reasons why every dollar you put
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.440]   into something that's kind of speculative can come back
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.880]   three or fourfold, so long as you're investing in ideas
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.760]   and not locked into a specific product that you're making.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.200]   I have to decide that they want to go to three wheels.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.160]   God, I hope not.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:49.120]   There is a big three wheel electric car project.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.720]   Four six wheels, that'll be the iPad.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.560]   Exactly.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.400]   A little tank.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.080]   They're going to put it in perspective.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.520]   When you have 110,000 employees, 1,000,
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.800]   it's less than 1%.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.720]   It's not a small number.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.000]   It's still just dabbling.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.200]   It's a rounding error.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.960]   Their biggest advantage is having so much money
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.480]   that they can, again, spend five years on something
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.360]   and not even be assured that they're going to get
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.200]   their money back for it.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.560]   They're not going to love spending money
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.840]   on something that doesn't ship,
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.560]   but it's going to develop, as Renee says,
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.760]   it's going to develop technologies,
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   they're going to feed into a whole bunch of things.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.520]   I've talked to people who are no longer at Apple,
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.160]   who were pretty high level,
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.600]   and they said that there were things
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.440]   that Apple developed that they spent
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.120]   tens or even hundreds of dollars developing
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:29.920]   that he would die to have in his house.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.200]   And then they just said, "No, no, it's not."
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.040]   It's not the Bible.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:33.960]   It's not the business we want to be in.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.880]   Yep.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.680]   I can't tell all the details, but about six years ago,
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.840]   I was shown something absolutely shocking
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.320]   that it was a consumer level device of something
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.680]   that I would never have imagined a company like Apple
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.680]   getting into, but it was just, as you said,
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.240]   it was something that they put a lot of time and effort into,
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:03.360]   but then they ultimately decided it doesn't fit into our plan.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.720]   I'm not saying that I was taken to a secret meeting.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.200]   It was something that someone showed me something
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.720]   that they should not have shown me
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.320]   with the understanding that I would not talk about it
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.920]   in any way that would affect them directly.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.000]   They're now fine.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.960]   Yeah, well, they've left the company
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:17.800]   like three or four years ago,
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.200]   so I wouldn't be talking about it right now.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.840]   But it struck me as, wow, if A,
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.560]   I wonder if this person's playing a trick on me or B,
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.440]   I wonder if I'm missing so much context about this
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.320]   that I don't know why they're working on this.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.320]   But then after the iPhone and the iPad came out,
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.600]   you sort of understand that, okay,
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.880]   that would not have made any sense given that,
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.400]   but it's exactly that situation where you're shocked.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.320]   When you have that much money,
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.920]   you can quote waste, unquote money on things
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.440]   that are interesting but not necessarily gonna directly
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.880]   make your next earnings call more interesting
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.880]   for the investors.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.320]   And I think that you have to do that.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.880]   I mean, as a company, you have to have a lot of dead ends.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.800]   In a much smaller scale, I definitely take lots of dead ends
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.640]   doing what we do.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.520]   And we used to go, well, that was a mistake,
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:09.520]   and that didn't work out, but we have to keep on,
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.720]   that's how you keep moving your company forward.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.440]   - And Apple has other interests.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.400]   For instance, they just hired a big shot
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.520]   in virtual reality and AR.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:25.520]   Doug Bowman, presumably to helm an AR research at the
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.120]   - That's the rumors that they've already been
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:28.960]   continuing with it.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:29.800]   - Yeah, obviously they're getting a little more serious.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.520]   - They bought some companies about company last year.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.360]   - They have a lot of patents in it.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.200]   - Yeah.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.120]   Doug Bowman was at Virginia Tech.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.560]   He was on sabbatical.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.000]   He's the director of the University Center
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.840]   for Human Computer Interaction.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.880]   You know what, I could easily see them doing other stuff
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.440]   besides VR and AR with him.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.600]   - You imagine Leo in the Apple driverless car,
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.400]   they can make you think, like you're on your way to work,
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.960]   it's a highway, but outside, all you see is Provence
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.800]   or Venice.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.720]   - How about this better?
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.080]   Yeah, they just stay in the driveway
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.240]   and they make you think you're a word.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.920]   - What if at one point, like you suddenly snap awake
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.920]   and you're in this tub of goo with this pose in your neck?
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.040]   - It took the blue pill.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.800]   I told you not to take the blue pill.
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.760]   - When you think about AR from a car perspective,
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.600]   I mean, imagine being able to go to a tourist site.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.760]   Let's say like Gettysburg.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:15.600]   - Oh, there's lots of stuff.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.200]   - And have a them drive you around Gettysburg
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.400]   and as you look out the windows,
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.920]   you see things that would have happened overlaid
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.080]   and more information.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.880]   - They'd be crazy not to be working on this.
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.560]   - No, Microsoft is, Google is.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.720]   - And given that it takes years and years and years
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.400]   to get your head around it, again,
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.200]   this is another one of the things
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.520]   they can spend $100 million a year.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.360]   - They need to.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.200]   - Figuring them out, they have to.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.200]   - If they didn't, I would say they were, you know,
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.480]   in violation of their fiduciary duty.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.680]   - It's super interesting because everybody can use a phone,
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.800]   but with VR you have people who are claustrophobic
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.280]   and won't like it and you have people
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.520]   who can't focus and converge
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.400]   without getting vertigo in the same plane.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.760]   But also from a Facebook point of view, for example,
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.080]   on a desktop, you can just close your Facebook browser.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.240]   On a phone, you can just close the Facebook app.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.400]   When it's sitting on your head,
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.720]   they have a much more immersive heart to leave experience.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.000]   - And just rip the helmet off as I've done many times.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.320]   - Yeah, the companies are in a fart.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.640]   - The Facebook has shown clearly
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.600]   that what they want is attention.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.400]   They bought Instagram, they bought WhatsApp
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.760]   because that's threatened Facebook attention.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.520]   And now if you have a virtual world,
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:13.320]   companies are gonna want control of that virtual world.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.000]   - Now, the biggest question that I'm getting,
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.640]   that these engineers are asking,
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:20.200]   at least the ones that I've been talking to,
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.720]   is really they're trying to figure out
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.160]   that whatever we build today
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.840]   is definitely not the thing that we're trying to build.
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.840]   It's only the thing that we can see right now
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.960]   because it's the logical next step.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.840]   Think about 15 years ago,
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.840]   what someone would imagine a mobile phone
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:37.600]   would look like right now.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.320]   They would figure that,
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.920]   well, they must have figured,
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.240]   they'll definitely figure out a way
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.320]   to put a full-sized keyboard in there.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.880]   And they'll definitely figure out a way
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.040]   to put in a printer, not a full-sized printer, of course,
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.920]   but something so that you could print out a ticket.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.360]   They would not have figured out the idea
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.720]   that maybe the screen will be so high resolution
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.360]   and they'll be a way of encoding visual information
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:00.440]   so densely that you could actually have a secure 2D barcode
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.000]   that would represent your ticket.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.160]   All that sort of stuff was unimaginable.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.040]   And that's exactly the sort of thinking that,
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.160]   when people at a certain high level are working on this,
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.120]   they're saying that Oculus Cinema is a really good idea.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.800]   The idea of an immersive game
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.960]   or an augmented reality experience
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.560]   where you look around and we're annotating things
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.560]   is a good experience.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.480]   That's only the stuff that we can think about
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.040]   because we grew up with games
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.960]   and we grew up with Google searches.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.680]   So it's gonna be nothing like that.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.840]   As a matter of fact, I would be surprised
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.000]   if anybody who is in college right now
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.360]   is even gonna be capable of writing those apps.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.400]   It's gonna be people who are taking their first coding course
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.320]   in junior high or sixth grade right now
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.160]   that's gonna crack it.
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.840]   - And I think that what's interesting is that
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.560]   when my kid said, oh, we never use email, we just text,
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:49.000]   and then they use message apps and everything else.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.960]   And I was like, that's crazy.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:51.800]   I don't even know.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.360]   They'll get around to it.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.840]   And yeah, I'm really annoyed by every email now.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.720]   Like I'm used to-- - Yeah, I wish Red Slaps
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:00.760]   had texted me. - I've never responded.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.760]   - Well, I mean, that's the whole thing is like,
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.200]   and people say, well, what's the best way to get a hold of you?
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.800]   And I'm like, they emailed me that.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.200]   And I was like, not email.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.320]   You know, what did you use to have a voicemail message?
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.120]   - Yeah, my voice is still my voicemail message.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.680]   It just says, hi, this is Alex.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.240]   If you're getting this message, don't leave a message.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.760]   I'm not gonna check it out now.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.640]   - You know, when I say go to email,
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.560]   then I'm gonna say-- - Go to email.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.160]   - Don't go to email either.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.760]   - Yeah, yeah, but I'm afraid to tell them to text it
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.840]   'cause I don't want them to actually text.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:26.680]   - Well, that's the problem.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.600]   The whole problem with email is that too many people
[01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.440]   can do it.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.440]   So texting works because it's smaller.
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.280]   It's a subset.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.640]   - Well, what I like about messengers is I can control it.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.720]   Like what I don't like is text, I hate text now
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:40.680]   because I don't want random people to have my phone number.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.120]   So I want something in between you--
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.880]   - People message me at Telegram
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.680]   because I've given out my Telegram.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:46.520]   - Right, right.
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.240]   - And it's manageable still.
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.600]   But if everybody started doing that,
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.400]   it would be more unmanageable than email.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.640]   At least with email, I've developed a lot of filtering
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:56.000]   and capabilities that I will never get in the message.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.160]   - But I want to-- - I was just taking up
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.800]   my email 'cause it's group based slack
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.560]   because especially for work email,
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.440]   which is the entire company uses slack
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.080]   so no one sends those emails anymore and it's delightful.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:08.600]   - Yes, but again, I make the point that you,
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.440]   that's because it's a constrained subset
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:13.720]   of your total universe of people who want to reach you.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.480]   And if everybody who wanted to reach you
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.880]   just stopped using email and you slack,
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.040]   it would be more unmanageable, I think,
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.280]   than your email class which is--
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.120]   - Plus the scale, right?
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.960]   Like messaging is the most intimate slack is bigger
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.280]   because it has more management tools
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.120]   and you can have bigger--
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:25.960]   - So you still need email.
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:26.800]   - You still need email.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.240]   - Yes, man, email. - I'm saying you don't need it.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.080]   I don't need it.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.600]   I just don't like it.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.280]   - It's kind of like-- - No, everybody hates it
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:33.360]   'cause it's unmanageable.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.800]   But it's better than the alternatives for--
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:38.880]   - I don't hate it, at least for a large part of my business.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.400]   I like the idea that the implication of email
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.200]   is that I'm going to sit down and I'm going to think
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.560]   and I'm gonna write something that really makes sense
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.760]   in and of itself, even if it takes two paragraphs
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.160]   to get my point across.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:55.240]   You might not be able to get a little dingus that says
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:58.440]   Andy Inato is typing, but you will get a response
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.960]   within the next hour or the next day
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:00.840]   that is considered.
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.360]   I had a, I would call it a negotiation,
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.920]   there's a film I'm gonna be involved in
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.800]   and we're trying to get a certain site for it.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.600]   And it would have been really, really hard to do this
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.000]   if we're doing it in chat
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.400]   or even if we're doing it in Slack
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:17.320]   where it's like one sentence or one phrase at a time.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.640]   It would really have, email was really gonna be
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.480]   the best way to do it.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.360]   I hope that it never go, I'm glad that there's such a wide
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.320]   variety of ways to communicate.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.320]   Slack is really, again, for teams,
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.440]   it's the only, really the only way to fly.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.280]   But I would hate it if email went away because again,
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.280]   I like that there's one venue where it's expected
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.400]   that you are not gonna respond instantly
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.760]   and you're not gonna make it just half a sentence
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.200]   with no uppercase, you're gonna actually try to tell a story
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.640]   with a beginning and a middle and an end,
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.440]   even if it's, I'm sorry, I have an infected foot.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.600]   And I think I can climb those stairs,
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:56.960]   but I, but the salve is working handsomely
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.640]   and I expect to be able to.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.720]   - Why would I get an email like that?
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.560]   (laughing)
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.680]   - I think that the thing is that it's,
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:03.800]   what's interesting is that we have,
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.720]   we have so many choices for modes now, you know,
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.800]   and we're still misusing them at times.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.360]   You know, I think that video, for instance,
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.400]   video chat, whether it's Hangout or Skype or whatever,
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.760]   I think is great as long as you have something to show,
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.200]   but do not put me in a video chat where we're just talking.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.360]   Like I don't wanna do that at all.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.680]   It's like now I have to unit ask and you can always tell
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.320]   if I'm video chatting 'cause I'm really irritated
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.840]   and wanna get out of the, get out as fast as possible.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:26.560]   If you get me on a phone and I'm not,
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.400]   you know, if you let me be on the phone,
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.080]   I'll be cleaning my desk or something like that
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.440]   and I'll talk to you for hours.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.600]   But so I find that phone is really good
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.040]   for trying to figure something out.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.560]   Like, okay, we have to figure something out
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.080]   and we have to kind of just test a bunch of stuff
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.440]   and go through it all.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.960]   Once we wanna identify what we actually have to get done,
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.360]   then email turns out for me to be the best way to do that.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.560]   We're gonna have a series of question and answers
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.360]   and everyone's gonna put an entire line
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.560]   under every question, damn it.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.320]   You know, like I hate it when people give me like six questions
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.040]   in a paragraph 'cause now I have to hit space
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.520]   and then hit return and then go to the next one,
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.960]   hit return so I can, you know, break it all down.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.160]   Then when we're just discussing stuff,
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.400]   when you're asking if you're gonna make a meeting,
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.920]   I do not want an email that someone asks me,
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.200]   hey, I don't want emails to say,
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.760]   are we going to make it at seven o'clock?
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.520]   That's a text, that's like a text world.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:13.520]   So I got this email with a link to crash safari.com.
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.560]   Should I click that link?
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.480]   Oh, oh, come on.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.280]   Okay, do it, do it, should I?
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.120]   Go for it.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.880]   - I don't click it on anything, just yeah, no, it's a--
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.480]   - I'm gonna show you an iOS, show my screen,
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.640]   which screen should I hit here?
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.760]   Let's go here, crash safari.com.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.840]   Let's see, it's probably gone by.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.080]   - That was awesome.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.840]   - That not only crashed safari, it crashed springboard.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.000]   - It turned local sideways.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:33.840]   - It could be one of three.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.680]   - Oh my God.
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.960]   That was a, that was a re-spring, okay.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.400]   - Yeah, so it's a little bit complicated
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.920]   because basically what it's doing is it's using JavaScript
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.000]   to get to overwhelm the history events in the browser.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:45.960]   It will do different things.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:49.120]   For example, Safari might, it might just crash the app.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.880]   So you'll just be dumped back to springboard.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.960]   It might crash springboard and then springboard will respawn
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.680]   or sometimes it might crash the device.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.360]   I've had it freeze Chrome.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.840]   Some people have had it do nasty things
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.520]   and I'd explore it though, I couldn't duplicate that.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.480]   - So it does stuff in Chrome too, it's not just safari.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.760]   - Well, it's just trying to spring process as Chrome so far
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.440]   is just beach balled for me and then I just stopped it
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.280]   and it worked fine.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.080]   - You could probably close that tab
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:12.200]   'cause they do, I think Chrome Sandbox is tabs.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.560]   - Yeah, Safari does too, but it, oh, it's specifically designed.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.320]   This one I think people would be designed to target safari.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.160]   Yeah, Apple is very--
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.800]   - Let me try it Chrome, I'm in Chrome right now, let's see.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.240]   Crash safari, oh, look at that.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.440]   Did you see that that go across the,
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.480]   this is doing something here, it's spinning.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:28.320]   - Yeah.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.400]   - But I think I was running a JavaScript
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.160]   going over and over again, it's basically doing it.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.520]   It's almost like an internal denial of--
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.840]   - Yeah, but if I close that tab, oh, I can't.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.480]   'Cause it's going so fast that you can't.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.320]   - Again, the results can be--
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.160]   - Switch.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.720]   - On the state of the machine.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.400]   - I just can't close that tab.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:47.400]   Reload or close tab.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:51.600]   It, oh, no, still there.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.080]   It hasn't crashed it yet.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:53.920]   - No.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.080]   - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:55.920]   - But it renders it super annoying.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.320]   - It's starting to crash it.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:58.400]   (laughing)
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.880]   It's the beginning of the crashing.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.800]   - It's like a slow death on the--
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.640]   - So what do we do Renee?
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.480]   - So yeah, it's a couple things.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.440]   So first Apple is aware of it and they're,
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:09.040]   they're looking into a fix, so hopefully that'll be sent out soon.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.920]   In the meantime, you treat it like you would a phishing attack.
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.560]   You just don't click on those links.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.600]   If you get, people are trying to prank people
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.000]   by disguising the links.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.840]   So on OS 10 hover over the link,
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.280]   so it's expanded to the full link and you can see it.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.840]   On iOS, just long press, so touch your finger on the link
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:25.040]   and wait for it to pop up the full URL
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.520]   so that you can see what it is.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.080]   And try to avoid URL shorteners
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.840]   because you never know what's lurking behind those,
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.160]   especially with redirects.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.240]   So treat it exactly like you would a phishing attack.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.240]   - I force Quick Chrome and all as well.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.240]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:38.880]   Good to know.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.640]   I think this, obviously, the person who created the site
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.800]   is not malicious, so that he wouldn't have named it
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.320]   crashed as far as he-- - There's a funny.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.000]   - They're showing, well, they're demonstrating a flaw.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.840]   - Yeah, it's like a Rick Roll of--
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.800]   - Yeah. - It's like a nasty Rick Roll.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.960]   That is a really, that's like, that's a Rick Roll with teeth.

[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.160]   Rick Roll with teeth.

[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:08.800]   Let's take a break.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:09.880]   You wanna do pics, folks?
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.440]   You ready for some pics of the week?
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.680]   Oh yeah. - Love it.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:15.640]   - I got one.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.320]   There's no knowns and there's unknown knowns.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.080]   There's knowns we don't know and there's knowns we know.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.440]   - Oh, you've been doing a lot of rum fill.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.280]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.120]   - I got the rum fill.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:25.960]   - I got the rum fill.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.800]   - I got the report last night, too.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.640]   - It's good!
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.580]   Stained by.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:34.320]   But first, a word from LegalZoom.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.160]   LegalZoom is great.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.520]   We set up a new LLC, used LegalZoom.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.280]   They say, so nice, they send you a kit
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.800]   and all the forms you need.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.080]   Turns out a lot of legal work that you might wanna do
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.080]   doesn't require a lawyer.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.080]   It's just forms, dumb forms.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.200]   You could save so much money by just doing the forms yourself
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.600]   and not spending $250 an hour, $350 an hour.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.680]   Lawyers cost a lot of money, you know, by the hour.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.240]   They really end up.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.600]   - Yeah, they do.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.520]   As a lawyer, son, I can say.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.360]   - Yeah, you know.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.280]   They cost a lot of money.
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.120]   - They cost a lot of money.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.440]   - They cost a lot of money.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:06.800]   Get your life organized with LegalZoom
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:09.360]   if you've been putting off a will.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.200]   You should do that, living trust.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.360]   They can do that all with LegalZoom.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.160]   LegalZoom's estate plan bundles eliminate the guesswork.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.000]   Guesswork.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.320]   And by the way, they do have a legal plan
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.320]   with pre-negotiated flat rates with independent lawyers.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.920]   So if you have a question,
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.680]   you can talk to an independent attorney in most states.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.920]   So you can decide, well, there's a will better living trust.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:33.960]   LegalZoom's awesome.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.720]   It's not a law firm.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:39.960]   So you can count on efficiency and value.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.560]   Everything is on your terms, on your schedule.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.800]   You'll know what your estate plan bundle costs up front
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.240]   instead of worrying about hourly rates.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.160]   It really takes away a big impediment
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.680]   to doing some things that you really should do,
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.320]   especially that will or that trust.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.440]   That's how LegalZoom's become the leader
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.000]   in helping small business owners like us
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.400]   and families with their legal needs.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.800]   You get legal help and you walk away feeling great.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.760]   We've been really happy.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.040]   I've used LegalZoom a lot now for all sorts of stuff.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.240]   And I've never had a problem.
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.680]   It's always been great.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.080]   Get your life organized with the state plan bundle

[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:40.920]   I showed this yesterday on iOS today, but it's so good.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.520]   And it kept me up so late, I couldn't stop playing it
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.080]   that I thought I'd show it also as a pick of the week.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.400]   Donald, this was the weird thing.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.640]   I thought it was an onion article.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:51.560]   Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rovsfeld.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:54.520]   The guy who said there are no unknowns and knowns
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.520]   and knowns we don't know.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.400]   And then he was the Secretary of Defense
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:01.160]   during the first, no, the second Afghan war.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.280]   He was under George W, right?
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.240]   I can't remember.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:08.040]   Anyway, apparently when he was a member of Congress,
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.960]   a statesman from Belgium or somewhere.
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.440]   He had an ambassadorship, I think.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.280]   Oh, is that it?
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.120]   He has an ambassador.
[01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.800]   So he had an ambassadorship and another ambassador showed it
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.160]   to them and told him that this is the way Romsfeld liked.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:18.880]   Or this is the way--
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.360]   Churchill.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.960]   Churchill played solitaire.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.320]   He said, it was taught to me by Churchill,
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:24.880]   and I'm going to teach it to you, Donald.
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.480]   So really, this is like, again, from the horse's mouth.
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.240]   And you know what?
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.840]   It is the best solitaire I've ever played.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.640]   And I'm not a solitaire fan.
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.720]   But I thought this was really good.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.720]   It's called Churchill Solitaire.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:38.560]   It's free, but you only get 200 random hands if you play free.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.760]   And then you'll pay $4.99.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.920]   You get unlimited random hands.
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.320]   You can also pay if you wish for undo's and hints.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.320]   I wouldn't.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.920]   What makes it interesting is it's a traditional kind
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.640]   of solitaire board, except for a couple of things.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:52.440]   First of all, it's two decks.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.600]   That makes it a lot harder.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.120]   And then there's this, what they call the devil's pile.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.760]   There's six cards randomly chosen.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.840]   And those six cards never go on the board.
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.800]   They all go up here.
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.560]   Of course, your goal is to sort the cards into all--
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:11.080]   because it's two decks, eight suits.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.360]   And so they can only get in here.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.880]   And if you don't get the devil's pile,
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:17.160]   you can't win the game, even if you cleared the board, which
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.960]   makes it devilishly hard.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.840]   It's really nice, as you can see on the iPad.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.440]   They take advantage of the real estate.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.840]   I think they've done a good job.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.440]   There's a lot of Churchill stuff in it,
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.720]   which is kind of hysterical.
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:28.560]   It's great.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.000]   We'll fight them on the beach.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.160]   We will fight them on the Charlotte--
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.440]   I thought it was silly when it first came out.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.280]   I think that's-- yeah.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.480]   But fair catch.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:36.280]   Charlotte, yeah.
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.400]   You get a few-- there are a few settings.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.520]   I like the big cards, but you could
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.360]   choose the regular size cards.
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.440]   I'm going to use a Winston Churchill card back.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:45.200]   Never give up.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:45.920]   Never give up.
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:46.280]   Never.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.600]   You might want to turn off the music
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.320]   because it goes on.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.120]   And it's very-- it's Marshall, of course,
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:50.600]   Donald Rumsill.
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:55.040]   It should give you Churchill's martini mix to drink while--
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.480]   I would guess that being drunk while you play this
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:58.760]   would make it even more fun.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:00.480]   And you know that that's the way he played it.
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:02.920]   I think that's the way he played everything.
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.800]   And make it in the films.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:07.640]   So here's the music.
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:09.040]   You know, it's very Marshall.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.560]   There's a-- at the beginning, there's
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.680]   a video of Churchill and stuff.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.680]   It's kind of fun.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.480]   They have a campaign, which is good.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:18.280]   You know, I really like it because you can choose
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.400]   how hard you want it to be.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.920]   So they're non-random deals.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.480]   And by the way, choose easy.
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:24.160]   Have some fun.
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:28.120]   [LAUGHS]
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:28.960]   It's kind of funny.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.320]   The music is a little over the top.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:33.080]   That's hard to focus.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:33.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.800]   But you eliminate the music right away.
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.320]   But it is-- I'm not a big Sauter fan,
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:42.200]   and yet I found this quite the compelling game.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.360]   So you could play it for free.
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:48.040]   That probably-- 200 hands, that probably be enough.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.760]   They give you the-- the tutorial makes it very easy.
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.720]   Here's the Devil's 6.
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:55.360]   They can only go to the Victory Rose.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.920]   And you've played Sauter.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:59.360]   You know, you alternate, black and white.
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.360]   You can't ask for hints.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.520]   That wouldn't be--
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.160]   I'm going to go hear you over the--
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:05.080]   Should I turn the music up?
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.840]   It's a little-- really ridiculous.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.720]   It's really silly.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:08.680]   Here's the good news.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:09.760]   Do you think you play the whole time?
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.040]   Does it play the whole time like that?
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:11.560]   Wow.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.200]   That would be really--
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.120]   Just turn it off.
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.360]   Little vodka, red bull.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.320]   And it's a test.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.920]   And you'd be in some of the--
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.840]   [SINGING]
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.120]   The other nice thing is you can stop,
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.400]   and it will save your position on the board.
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:24.760]   So it's-- you know what?
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.080]   It's good.
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:25.720]   It's well-made.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.680]   It's very well-made.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.600]   I don't know really how much Donald Rumsfeld
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:30.640]   had to do with it.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.400]   I don't even know why his name is on it.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.200]   You know, I wouldn't be surprised if he was talking
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.800]   to someone like, I got this thing.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.640]   I still haven't found any iPad.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:38.280]   And-- yeah.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.000]   Why doesn't anybody have Churchill, Sauter?
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.880]   He was talking about it last night in the Colbert--
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.960]   Oh, was he?
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.440]   And he was saying that to his knowledge,
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.160]   like, he was taught the game by someone who
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.280]   worked with Churchill.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:50.880]   Right.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.880]   And he was-- and to his knowledge,
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:55.400]   there were only, like, a couple other people that no ever
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.280]   knew this game.
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:56.800]   Right.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.960]   It was not as though this--
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:58.920]   I've never seen it.
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.080]   Let's say the story he told, which
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.920]   needs to be verified by an independent UN party,
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.600]   is that this was not like a known game of Sauter--
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.080]   This is the yellow cake of Sauter stories.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.560]   Exactly.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:15.560]   But you know, at this point, it's fine.
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:16.240]   I don't care.
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.440]   And you know what?
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.800]   It is a really fun Sauter game.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.800]   I have to admit, I want to play it with the regular cards,
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:22.300]   too.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.120]   Like, there's something about it.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:23.620]   You could.
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:25.120]   I mean, there's no reason now that you know the rules.
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:25.760]   It was very simple.
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.920]   You could just get two decks of cards and play it.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.320]   The interesting thing, Leo, for me--
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.120]   I played it last night forever--
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.880]   --is when you go to the deck.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.880]   It's not like a normal game where you just deal out three
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:36.380]   cards.
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:37.960]   It goes to every stack.
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:39.440]   Oh, that's another thing that's different.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:39.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:40.960]   Any stack that's doesn't--
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:44.600]   isn't topped by a king, gets a new card.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:47.560]   So, man, that can screw you up big time.
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:51.480]   You really want to manage--
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:53.760]   you don't want to go to the deck if you can help.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.000]   Like Tetris.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.760]   Yeah, but it's fun for that reason.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.160]   I must have said this pretty easy,
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:02.200]   because I'm actually doing surprisingly well
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.920]   for a man of my limited intelligence.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.040]   But it's a lot of fun, I have to say.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.640]   So that's my pick.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.040]   Churchill's Sauter.
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:13.760]   Yes, you're putting money in the pocket of a war criminal.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.120]   No, no, you're not.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.960]   He said he's put all his income--
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.800]   if he gets any income, he says, going to charity.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:19.320]   Good.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:20.680]   And I was being facetious.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.040]   Well, he was a little bit cagey about that.
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.760]   He was very specific.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:28.560]   He used earnings call language with Colbert,
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:31.760]   saying that I can't quote him exactly,
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:35.080]   but it was along the lines of a significant portion
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.880]   of the profits from this are going to--
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:38.720]   You know what?
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.840]   I don't care.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.960]   I just don't think he said 100%, but--
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:48.160]   Of all the games, game apps by accused war criminals,
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.160]   I mean, this is the best.
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:50.960]   This is the best.
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.320]   It's much better than Paul Pot pinball.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.320]   I'll tell you that.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:58.080]   And we have a title.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:00.880]   Andy, you're picking the week.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:03.040]   This is a great one, and Renee's going to love this one,
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:03.680]   I think.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:07.960]   I often travel with this, because I like taking pictures,
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.080]   and sometimes I always have to do like Skype calls.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.600]   And this is just a not terribly expensive LED battery
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.480]   panel.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.560]   So I use it a lot like when I'm taking pictures.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.360]   I want to put some fill light on something,
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:25.040]   even when I'm just taking pictures with my phone like this.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.960]   And it's really quite handy and useful.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:30.000]   The problem is, of course, it's really, really big.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.400]   And I won't take it with me unless I really
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.000]   know I'm going to want to use it.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.280]   So instead, when I'm doing a chat,
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:40.960]   I'll just, like Renee has to do, just find a window.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.880]   But there is a really cool little pocket video light
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:44.880]   that was just released.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.200]   It was kick-started two years ago,
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.520]   but now it's commercially available called the Loom Cube.
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.080]   And I've been using it throughout this entire show,
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.200]   as a matter of fact, as a fill light.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.520]   It's a little tiny inch and a quarter, inch and a half
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:02.680]   cube that 1,500 k light.
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.760]   Not just what made a casing is made out of.
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:06.920]   I'll take it off the mountain effect to show to you.
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.920]   But first, I want to show you the app.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:11.520]   You can-- has buttons you can operate it as a standalone.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:14.920]   But you can also download an app for the iPhone
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:21.000]   or for Android and control it completely remotely.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.520]   So you can-- I can take the light all the way down.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.800]   I can take it all the way up.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.360]   I can turn on RedEye.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.480]   I can also take pictures with it,
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.280]   and it will use it as off-camera light.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.640]   It will actually-- it can even go into a strobe mode.
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:38.840]   The other really swell thing is that if you've got it--
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:41.760]   if you've got more than one, if you have actually two or three
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.800]   or four of them, you can actually use this one app
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.800]   to control each one of these individually.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.120]   So you can just basically set these up on stands
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:53.200]   or a little like wrap around a GorillaPod sort of lights
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.360]   and just place them around.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.000]   And then as you're about to take a picture,
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.120]   just basically adjust the lighting of each one of these
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.280]   individually until you're getting the image that you want.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.360]   The battery works great.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.880]   Again, it has been running for the past like hour and a half,
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.560]   since about 10 past two.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:12.080]   And the battery is still at-- and here's--
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.760]   you can give the battery level the still-- the battery
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.640]   is still at 60%.
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:18.400]   The model light it throws off is just insane.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.800]   I was taking-- I was outside in the backyard at night
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:24.840]   and just seeing how far we go, firing upward into the trees.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.920]   And all I can tell you is that I heard a distant squawk
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.680]   and then I smelled burnt feathers.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:31.320]   That's how bright it is.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.000]   But here, I'm going to take it off the--
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.080]   it's going to be pretty hot.
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.240]   So I'm going to try not to--
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.480]   I was going to tell you earlier while you were--
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.240]   when we just got started, I was going to say, Andy,
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.680]   ooh, wrong.
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:42.680]   Do look good.
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:43.680]   I'm so warm.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.680]   I'm so warm.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:46.920]   It looked like he had a really good shave, but it was the light.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.400]   It might is more important than any of the light.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.120]   Just in case I'm going to take it off the--
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:54.760]   I'm going to hold the spin on for like two hours.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.000]   And it's a-- there's such cool warning lights,
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.920]   warning symbols on it when you take it off.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:03.680]   It says, oh, look, do not look at the light when you turn--
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:04.480]   because that's right.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.600]   --it tickles the box and you're going to want to push buttons.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.240]   But I swear, do not--
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.120]   actually, it's not that bad.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:11.520]   I can actually hold it, even though it's
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.320]   been at high intensity.
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:14.760]   So it does have its own--
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.320]   Oh, it's so tiny.
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:16.680]   --right button out.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.520]   Exactly.
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:20.080]   It's just this small.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.480]   And as I said, it has two buttons at the very top here
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:26.160]   so that here's this button that will actually just give you
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.840]   a pop of flash.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:30.920]   And here is the light that will turn on.
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:34.000]   And you can adjust it up to 10 levels.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.240]   At 10, it's just in sanity.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:38.240]   Really, Ds.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.200]   Is there nothing they can't do?
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:40.440]   It's really--
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:41.520]   It is rechargeable.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.000]   It's a--
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:43.480]   It's huge.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.760]   We turn it off.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.600]   There you go.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.400]   As a matter of fact, the only connector
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.040]   is on the back here, a little--
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.840]   this connects a micro-USB charging thing.
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.680]   It takes about an hour and a half to charge up.
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.120]   Of course, you can take out that plug with just a coin or a washer.
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:03.600]   And it's fully gasketed.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.040]   It's not just weatherproof.
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:09.560]   It is actually submersible all the way down to 100 feet.
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.760]   So if you want to shoot underwater with it,
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.160]   you can shoot underwater with it.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.240]   They're selling it for basically all kinds
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.280]   of mobile applications.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:19.160]   For instance, on the site, you can buy a rig
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:22.880]   so that you can have two of these on a little strap
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.080]   with a GoPro in the middle.
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.080]   So obviously, you can take it diving with you
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.040]   and shoot it underwater as an action cam.
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:29.160]   Like I said, it was--
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.800]   I didn't even--
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:33.840]   I knew it would be wrong to actually ask for a loner of this
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:36.640]   because as a guy with two travels with one of these,
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.400]   who am I kidding?
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.040]   I'm just really excited to hopefully see
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:42.200]   that this will actually be something I would want to own.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:46.120]   And I took it out shooting yesterday only locally,
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:49.600]   not the big bamboo shot.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.680]   And it was exactly what I wanted it to be.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.280]   I posted some pictures of just some stuff
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:59.600]   that I was posting on Instagram of just like, here's a button
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.000]   that I just put on my bag.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.920]   And again, you can either take a crappy photo with your phone
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.760]   or you can just turn this on, get a little bit of distance.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.600]   Instead of having it shooting right directly
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:14.120]   from the camera lens, get a little bit of positions
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.240]   from an angle.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.880]   And not only are you getting great light,
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.120]   but it's also from an angle so it looks really, really beautiful.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:23.000]   So this is going to be-- this is going to live inside my bag
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.360]   and it's never coming out because it's just so useful.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.920]   The only bad things I will say about it, not bad,
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.880]   but sort of qualms, the light is neutral.
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:35.080]   I think it's something like 6,000, I think, 6,500, whatever
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.600]   daylight balanced neutral light is,
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.960]   which means that if you're taking pictures--
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.200]   like if you're taking selfies and this works really good
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:45.400]   for selfies, especially group selfies,
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.440]   you can actually kind of see it here a little bit where it's
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.360]   neutral light.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.760]   It's not really flattering light for skin.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.120]   It will come out looking a little bit cold.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:57.040]   But that's a pretty easy to fix and b,
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:01.360]   if that's really a problem, you can just buy an orange filter
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.320]   or orange gel.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:04.800]   They don't make them, but it's easiest to find and put it over it
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:06.200]   and just adjust it that way.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.880]   Also, the lighting-- it's not the advantage of something
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.760]   like this is that the source of light is a big, wide source.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.200]   It's almost like it's in its own softbox.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:21.360]   This is-- I think it's four LEDs inside behind a sort of lens,
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:25.760]   but still it's very direct and it's a little bit harsh.
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:29.400]   So as a matter of fact, I'm thinking of getting a second one
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:33.360]   so that if I really did want to do good lighting in the field,
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.400]   I could have one as my key light here,
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:39.880]   but then another one a little bit less bright as a fill right
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.800]   here that would soften some of those shadows.
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.240]   Well, and really, really happy with it.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.040]   It is coming out of the cover with some--
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:45.600]   Well, there's--
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:50.640]   So Andy and I traded a couple emails about this cube,
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.640]   and I didn't have one.
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:53.640]   I'm going to have one in a bag.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:55.880]   Oh, no, mine arrives.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:57.040]   Mine arrives today.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.040]   Today, later, when I get home, I have to talk to Andy.
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.200]   I was like, this is--
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:00.960]   For $80 bucks?
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.520]   I got two of them.
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:03.160]   The other thing is--
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.160]   Let's get these in stores as well.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:07.880]   They make little softboxes, not for these, but for flashes.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:09.320]   And so what I'm going to play with
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:12.120]   is taking one of those little flash ones, the flash softbox,
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:15.000]   and put two of them next to each other in the center
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.080]   of where the flash would normally insert,
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.640]   and then taping them in and turning them on.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.040]   And I think that then I'll get a nice little--
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.400]   There's a lot of power going into this little softbox.
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:26.000]   And I think it'll actually be really nice.
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.720]   You can even go simpler than that.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.320]   I've been experimenting a lot.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.760]   I'm starting to bring things with me.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:35.360]   But even something like, here is the cap off of a juice bottle
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.520]   that's nearby.
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.720]   You just put that over it and go like that.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.120]   And that will actually soften the light and diffuse it pretty well.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.240]   I've actually have a--
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:51.440]   you've ever buy those Rubbermaid collection of storage containers.
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:53.240]   And they got all the big, useful ones.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:55.320]   And they give you these two tiny ones that are just only
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:56.760]   good for a little bit of sauce.
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:59.840]   Turns out that that's the perfect size for this.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.920]   And because it's plastic, that's translucent,
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:04.400]   but not transparent.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.240]   That also diffuses it a little bit.
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.920]   And it's because it's about the right size for this.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.280]   I can actually put it inside it, put the lid on it,
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.200]   and it will protect the lens from getting scratched.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.640]   But like I said, oh, another mode I forgot to mention,
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.600]   it does also have a sensor right here.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.680]   I don't know if you can see it, this little dot right there.
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:24.400]   That's actually a light sensor so that if you're using a camera
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.320]   with an actual strobe flash, you can actually put it in slave mode
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:29.240]   so that it will actually just pop some--
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:32.040]   it'll actually be used as a slave flash triggered
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.400]   by whatever other flash you do.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.120]   Can you slave it to the iPhone?
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.520]   I have not gotten it to work with the actual--
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.720]   It has an app, right?
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.320]   It was a little too clear.
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.960]   I was wondering if it would be a flash when you took the iPhone
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:43.480]   picture.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:44.480]   No.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:47.160]   Well, it would necessarily be important because you can always
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:47.800]   put this in--
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:49.000]   It just turns on.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:52.000]   But also, it will not-- no, I will say that it doesn't--
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000]   It's probably better anyway, right?
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.840]   It doesn't work as an accessory to the Apple Camera app.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:00.320]   Obviously, you're going to have to use the app that they give you
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.920]   for it as your phone app.
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:04.440]   But if you're going to use it as a triggered flash--
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:05.080]   Oh, so it will do.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:06.760]   It's triggering that way, though.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:07.280]   Exactly.
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:09.400]   You can trigger by Bluetooth that way.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:12.480]   And again, as a regular 1, 2, 3 go like this,
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:16.880]   because if you're using any other app than that,
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.280]   like the built-in app, you're going
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.120]   to have to use this in steady mode.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:22.400]   And it might be kind of hard on your--
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:24.960]   You have to make sure that you're not like, oh, OK, wait a minute.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:26.120]   I need to launch the app.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:26.560]   Hang on.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:27.840]   Keep looking inside the light.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:28.760]   Hang on.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.280]   Do you tape this to the selfie stick,
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.040]   or do you tape the iPhone to the selfie stick,
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.160]   and then the flash to the iPhone?
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.480]   I was actually thinking about that thing.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:39.840]   Oh my god, am I contemplating getting a selfie stick?
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.160]   You need totally the selfie sticks,
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.360]   because you don't want the flash to--
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:44.240]   You need a selfie stick with the Y.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.800]   You need a selfie stick with the Y.
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.880]   Well, not just that, but sometimes you
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:51.400]   want something to be on over the thing you're photographing,
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:53.480]   or you want to get the right sort of angle for it.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.400]   The whole problem with on camera flashes
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.720]   is too close to the camera.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.320]   You put a lot of the ultimas, so the selfie stick.
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:45:59.960]   Yeah, back.
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.720]   But next week, next week, next week.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:03.120]   But it's great stuff.
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:06.160]   Like I said, I mean, it's exactly the sort of solution
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:09.040]   I like where you buy it, and you keep it inside your bag,
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:12.800]   and then for the rest of the year,
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.080]   whenever you're encountering a problem, ah, damn it, I can't.
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:15.680]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:21.080]   I have a solution in the form of this, even when--
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.160]   I did this actually with the headlamp light
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:28.160]   that I usually wear when I'm walking,
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.640]   because I was at the Metropolitan Opera thing.
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.560]   And they're mostly elderly people there,
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.560]   and they didn't bring the house lights up after it ended.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.680]   And a lot of these people with like canes and walkers
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:42.040]   were trying to make their way up the aisles in pitch dark.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:46.200]   So like a chivalrous young sport of 40 something,
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:49.360]   I was like there with my helmet lamp like this
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:51.080]   so that they can actually see their way
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.560]   without braiding themselves.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.600]   So now you're going to have the basic Star Trek,
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:00.280]   the next generation away team, flash light, wherever you go.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.360]   Because again, this is intensely, insanely bright.
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.080]   So again, for able--
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:06.720]   Exactly.
[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:07.160]   I'm really--
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.400]   I was checking his tracking.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:10.160]   It showed up at noon.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:10.800]   It showed up at noon.
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:11.640]   All right.
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:14.680]   It's at the office when I get home when I get back.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:16.560]   And of course, Andy, I would look at it like--
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:19.280]   the only thing I wish is they would interlock horizontally,
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:24.040]   because if the two work, I think that eight or 10 of them,
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:26.120]   like all in a big square behind it.
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.600]   You're not wrong.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:30.480]   And I was looking at this myself.
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.200]   Like these are--
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.520]   I'm glad that they didn't make this too fancy or complicated,
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.000]   because I bet that I could 3D print
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.280]   sort of like an egg cart and sort of thing.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:41.960]   Or like labels.
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.320]   And just bungee-coordinates.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.160]   And put them together.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:46.880]   I made something that looked very much like this when I was a kid.
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:49.560]   But what I did is I put interlocking, basically,
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:54.000]   like V slides so that you could slide one into the other.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:54.560]   And so--
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.040]   And you can connect them all like that,
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:58.000]   except mine fired things.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:58.880]   And see, Renee, I'm sure--
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:02.360]   I mean, Alex, I'm sure you've got a bunch of these filters,
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:03.360]   samples from--
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:04.360]   Oh.
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:05.720]   Oh, perfect size cuts.
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:06.800]   The samples will work.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:07.680]   You're totally right.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:08.480]   You can use filter samples.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.480]   Oh my god.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:11.160]   You can just go-- so you can go to any--
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:15.360]   so in any big city, you can go to an expendable store.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.800]   And they'll give you those samples.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.680]   So there's like five or six of them in New York.
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:19.880]   And there's a couple in San Francisco.
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.120]   And there's like 1,000 in LA.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.000]   So if you're in one of those, you can just go get the sample.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.120]   The sample will totally work.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.040]   That is a great idea.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:27.920]   OK, so I know what I'm doing next time in New York.
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:28.600]   Go ahead.
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:29.600]   I'm in Boston.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:30.680]   It's just a search--
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:32.280]   Just search Expendables in Boston.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:32.800]   You'll find it.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:37.360]   LoomCUB, L-U-M-E-C-U-B-E, loomcub.com.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.360]   Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.040]   So this is an app that I just saw this morning.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.720]   I was having breakfast with a friend of mine.
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:45.200]   And he was using this app.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.840]   And it is--
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:47.680]   I'm blanking on that name.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.880]   I just installed it.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.000]   It is called--
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:51.960]   Streaks.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.120]   Streaks, yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.600]   So Streaks is a 2D app that has--
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.520]   it's a little bit different.
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.320]   So it isn't like you make a list of things
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.800]   and you go through and do them.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:00.720]   It's designed to help you learn good habits.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.760]   So for example, you might have a digital app
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.760]   that's a digital scale and you want to make sure you weigh
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:06.120]   yourself every morning.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:06.960]   And it's smart.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.880]   So it won't just say weigh yourself at 7 o'clock.
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.120]   It'll learn that you typically weigh yourself before 8.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.840]   So when it gets to like 8.10, if you haven't confirmed it,
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:17.200]   it'll send you a little nudge saying, have you done this yet?
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:19.200]   And then you can-- oh, no, no, I'll go do it now.
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.160]   Or you can sleep it for a few minutes
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:22.640]   because you're going to get to it in a few minutes.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.040]   Or you can dismiss it.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.480]   But it's really great for anything.
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.200]   Like if you're practicing the piano,
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.800]   you want to make sure you put in your 10 minutes
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.200]   of practice time of day.
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.120]   It wants you to do to-do's that are reoccurring
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:34.880]   and that you tell it that you've done them.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.840]   And then it'll prompt you to make sure you get them done.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:39.960]   And it has a really, really cool watch implementation
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.280]   if you happen to wear an Apple watch.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.760]   First, for the health and fitness stuff,
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.200]   it syncs with the health app, which is that that data is
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:46.760]   everywhere.
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.920]   So you don't have to enter into data again?
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:49.800]   No, not at all.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:52.280]   And also, it'll do it on the watch tube.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:54.360]   But for example, it has a little complication on it
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.520]   that just shows dots.
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:58.080]   And once you get used to which order your dots are in,
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.600]   you'll quickly see which tasks you've got accomplished
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.840]   or ready for the day.
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.200]   And it just fits in one of those little compact,
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:08.280]   sized classes for the watch complications.
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:09.840]   And then you can just glance and go, yeah,
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.360]   I know that one is my wait in the morning.
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.720]   I know this one is the piano.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.840]   I haven't had the healthy meal yet, though.
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:16.440]   So I've got to make sure when I go for lunch,
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.240]   I can check that one off the list.
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:19.960]   And it's got all sorts of the built-in stuff,
[01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:23.400]   includes walk or run, workout, stand, burn active calories,
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:26.400]   record, wait, eat a healthy meal, run the, walk the dog.
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:29.440]   But also there's like, take a photo, practice the guitar,
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.200]   brush your teeth if you want to teach kids good habits,
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.080]   for example.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.000]   And you can make your own.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.800]   You just type in exactly what you want.
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:36.920]   And you can pick from a whole bunch
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.440]   of different icons for it.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.960]   And then you just set it up.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:42.560]   And it's super cool because tasks sometimes
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.640]   give you options for repetition.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:46.640]   But they're mostly based on like action items,
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.280]   on getting things done.
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:51.120]   And this is really optimized for building good habits.
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:52.320]   And the human brain is funny.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.000]   Like you do something once you'll forget about it.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.120]   It takes seven times to start remembering it.
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.280]   Many, many more than that to really make it a habit.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:01.160]   Because you've got to destroy malignant neuropathways,
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:04.280]   build good ones, and then make sure that they're established.
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:06.840]   And I started using it just today.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:08.160]   I'm eager to see how it works.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.360]   But I've been looking for something like this for a long time.
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.200]   So I'm super happy to have it.
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.520]   And you can add your own streaks.
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.280]   Like I'm going to add record blood sugar,
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:16.840]   because I have to test that regularly.
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:17.440]   That's nice.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.160]   And it's $3.99.
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.480]   Well worth it.
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:22.640]   So the biggest challenge I have going for Leo
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:24.880]   is they're once again adjusting prices in the Canadian app stores.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:26.800]   I'm going to say like $24.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:27.920]   And you'll look at me like I'm crazy.
[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:28.760]   You'll say it's $4.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:30.640]   And I'll be all embarrassed about it.
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:32.320]   But I think it was 6 plus Canadian for me.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.200]   Yeah, wow.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:34.320]   You got ripped off.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:34.800]   Wow.
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.760]   I think I $69 at $0.69 or something now.
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:37.360]   I'm plummeting.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.680]   So we'll see.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:39.240]   This is good.
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:43.240]   And another good reason to use that Apple Watch, I got to say.
[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:44.600]   And the health thing is great.
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:46.280]   The permissions are still hard to manage,
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:47.880]   because Apple is super granular.
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.760]   They made read and write a separate thing.
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:51.400]   To maintain your privacy if you want.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:53.960]   And again, that's because you're recording your blood sugar
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:56.000]   level doesn't mean you want your insurance company to know
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.960]   that you're recording your blood sugar level.
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:00.080]   So you can share without them even knowing that exists.
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.440]   So it doesn't even leak information
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:04.160]   that that's something that you are doing.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:06.760]   But once you set it up once, then it's just it's on your phone.
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:07.520]   It's on your watch.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:08.480]   It's in the app.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.120]   And if you eventually switch to another app,
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:11.400]   all that information is still there.
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:13.600]   It's not locked in the style of any one particular app.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:15.760]   It's called Streak, but they should have called it Nudge.
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:17.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:18.360]   What have been said again?
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:18.800]   I Nag.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:19.120]   I Nag.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:19.800]   I Nag.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:20.300]   I Nag.
[01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:21.800]   I'm sure they considered I Nag.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:22.300]   I Nag.
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:22.960]   You're not doing that.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:23.460]   Why are I Nag?
[01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:23.960]   Why?
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:24.460]   I'm going to buy that.
[01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:25.900]   You should take your weight already, Leo.
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:27.140]   Just go on the scale.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:27.980]   Why don't you?
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:28.860]   I'm adding sleep.
[01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:29.860]   You should sleep more.
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:31.620]   I think this is an important thing about that.
[01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:32.100]   Yeah.
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:33.420]   Sleep eight hours.
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:34.500]   I can't.
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:35.260]   Yeah.
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:36.660]   I'm not even capable of that.
[01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:37.500]   Really?
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:38.980]   I'm a progression of my father.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:41.460]   My father sleeps no more than four hours a night.
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:42.380]   Like he can't.
[01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:43.460]   Like he cannot--
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.100]   That's awesome.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:47.260]   As long as he's not sleepy.
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:47.980]   No, he's not asleep.
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:49.700]   Well, at nine o'clock, he dropped.
[01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:52.500]   What I found out that's awesome is when I'm on the west coast, I go to bed on Pacific
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:54.740]   time and I wake up on Eastern time and then I feel normal.
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:56.380]   Like I don't feel like I'm getting no sleep.
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:58.060]   My dad's like the old old school.
[01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:00.980]   Like he literally sleeps for a couple hours and then in the middle of the night he gets
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:03.380]   up and there's like a couple hours of him doing stuff and he goes back to bed for a
[01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:04.380]   little while and then he gets up.
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:06.660]   And I guess that that's the way they used to be before electricity.
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:08.180]   The European's yes to culture, right?
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:11.780]   I'm going to add take a photo every day.
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:12.780]   That would be a good one.
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:15.460]   I'm trying to take a 360 every day.
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:16.460]   Yeah.
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:17.460]   Some people do journal entries every day.
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:18.700]   Some people want to practice instrument.
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:19.220]   Journal.
[01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:20.540]   That's a good idea.
[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:21.540]   Nice.
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:26.340]   Streak, it's called and it may cost you more in Canada.
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:28.140]   700 dollars.
[01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:29.340]   700 dollars.
[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:30.340]   No.
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:31.580]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:37.140]   So I think I've been pretty good recently about not doing expensive ones, but I kind
[01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:39.820]   of I'm going to I got a little more expensive.
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:41.220]   Spend us some money.
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.700]   So I bought everything.
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:43.700]   By the way, I changed it.
[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:44.700]   Everybody's recommended.
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:45.700]   So well, this one.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.700]   You may break my streak.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:47.700]   There we go.
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:52.740]   This is the the Barringer XR 18.
[01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:55.900]   Now they have an XR 12, XR 16, XR 18, depending on what you need.
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.540]   You could spend less and everything else.
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:54:00.140]   I think this is in the $600 range.
[01:54:00.140 --> 01:54:05.940]   So if you've ever wanted to have like a mixer, but you just figured, why do I need all this
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:06.940]   hardware?
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:07.940]   I could just run it on my iPad.
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:08.940]   Well, yes, you can.
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:09.940]   Now, Mackie came out with one.
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:11.500]   Mackie was like the first one to do this.
[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:12.500]   He was Mackie free.
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:13.500]   And that was cute.
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:14.500]   It was cute.
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:17.020]   But this is a real like a real mixer.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:18.020]   It is.
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:22.540]   There is no artifice of like we're going to put something in there to make it look old
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:23.540]   or whatever.
[01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:25.900]   It is just like it's a rack mount and you can just plug everything into it.
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:27.660]   You've got six ox outs.
[01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:29.660]   You've got in this case, 18 in.
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.140]   Let's see a 10 out four.
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:32.140]   Because it's Wi-Fi.
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:36.460]   So what you can do with that Wi-Fi of course is open up your your iPad.
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:37.740]   You control it with your iPad.
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:38.940]   And you run everything with your iPad.
[01:54:38.940 --> 01:54:41.300]   Now the great thing is that that can be a little scary.
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.580]   Like what if you're in a big event and you don't want to run that yet.
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:49.420]   And actually you can still hook up to ethernet and still log into it with the baronger app.
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:51.220]   When we have a lot of baronger, a Midas board.
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:53.220]   Baronger has not always been this great.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:54.220]   This sound quality.
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:55.220]   So here's the deal.
[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:56.620]   We used to make fun of baronger.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:58.620]   And that was kind of like.
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:54:59.700]   It was kind of a crap.
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:02.820]   It was inexpensive and not great at all.
[01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:04.300]   Not even not great.
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:05.300]   Not not good.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:07.300]   In fact, horrible.
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:08.300]   Okay.
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:11.180]   You know, so like, you know, like we would never buy a baronger until.
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:12.180]   So then they bought Midas.
[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:14.820]   They might as have the best preamps in the world.
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:16.780]   So they bought Midas.
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:18.740]   And with that, now there's some Midas boards.
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:21.540]   We have a bunch of Midas boards and then there's baronger boards and the Midas boards
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:25.700]   are pretty much interchangeable except for the fact that they both have the Midas preamps.
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:28.180]   The Midas boards have a little bit more on them.
[01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:29.540]   And so we've got a bunch of those.
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:34.500]   But the big thing here is that is that they also added what's called.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:38.980]   Now they say it's based on Dan Dugan's auto mixing.
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:43.420]   It's not Dan Dugan, the Dan Dugan auto mixer because that was a big, I think, a legal issue.
[01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:44.420]   It's based on.
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:48.820]   So Dan Dugan is this kind of genius that created this auto mixing.
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:51.380]   So if you have three people sitting around or six people sitting around a table, what
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:53.860]   it does is it intelligently goes, that person's talking.
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:56.140]   And I'm just going to, I'm not going to gate everybody.
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:58.820]   I'm just going to push all the other mics down.
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:03.780]   And if you look at, you know, it is like we don't do an event with multiple mics without
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:05.980]   a Dugan mix somewhere in the thing.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:08.220]   So so it's fast enough when somebody starts talking.
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:09.220]   It picks it up.
[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:10.220]   Well, and it does it softly.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:11.220]   It doesn't naturally.
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:13.940]   So you're not, you're not doing this mix up and down.
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:16.940]   It just softly keeps all of the volume the same when one person starts to eat.
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:19.340]   18 mic channels.
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:20.940]   You can do a massive event.
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.100]   We should buy one of these.
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.100]   Wait a minute though.
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:24.100]   See, it's expensive.
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:27.220]   It was like 600 bucks or seven or so.
[01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:28.220]   It's not for a mixer.
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:29.220]   That's cheap.
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:30.220]   Really cheap.
[01:56:30.220 --> 01:56:31.220]   It's cheap.
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.220]   Most of our mixers are 3000 and above.
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:33.220]   So this is like great.
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:34.220]   This is my personal mixer.
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:36.540]   So that's what I'd say is that we have a lot of mixers and I carry it in my purse because
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.540]   that's really my new criteria.
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:38.540]   No, you can't.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:40.900]   I can take the loom cube in my purse.
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:44.740]   You can put it in a rush 24 if nothing else was in there.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:47.460]   But you can see the size.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:48.460]   It's big.
[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:49.460]   It's like this big.
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:50.460]   It's a mixer.
[01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:51.220]   It's actually a rack mount mixer.
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:56.140]   But if you're looking for this is again, this is my personal, the one that I'm using.
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:57:02.220]   I'm going to be using on my own, in my own little studio in my house.
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:03.220]   And we've got.
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:04.780]   That is really cool.
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:05.780]   It is.
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:06.780]   It's super nifty.
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:08.860]   I mean, when you think of back on all the days that we've.
[01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:11.260]   Boy, this would have been so great 10 years ago.
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:13.260]   It changed what it changed my life.
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:14.260]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:16.260]   It's nifty.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:17.260]   Wow.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:20.460]   And Marty Brennan, who works with us at the office, was, you know, he's got one.
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.660]   He uses it on shows all the time.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:23.300]   I think he's got, yeah, the 18.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:24.300]   But there's also smaller ones.
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:28.300]   So if you think that's too much and you can get the cool thing is I think the 12 is
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:29.300]   even one you.
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:30.300]   I mean, they get smaller.
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.900]   Yeah, because really you don't want to podcast with 18 people.
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:34.380]   You want to know.
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:36.140]   But you might have to remember those.
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:40.060]   There's a lot of times you have, well, what if we have audio on the roads now for our stuff?
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:42.540]   Do we have anything like this?
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:43.540]   We have.
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:46.540]   We do have, we still have the analog Mac key.
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:49.500]   And we can't really work with analog anymore.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:53.660]   Like we need to do so much stuff in ours, whether it's compression, the automics, like
[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:56.220]   the you're not going to get an automics with a, with a analog.
[01:57:56.220 --> 01:58:01.700]   And once you get used to an automics, you cannot, you cannot go back.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:07.660]   You know, we had to make a choice recently between the automics and the, and a cedar noise
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:08.660]   removal.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:11.620]   And we went with the automics because it was still, it made a bigger difference.
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:16.220]   And so, because there's so much phasing that goes on between mics and stuff, not like this,
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:20.780]   because these mics are so, you know, have such good off axis rejection.
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:27.100]   But anyway, it's, it's a little geeky, but I would have killed to have this in the day
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.220]   back in the day when I was a kid.
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:30.220]   Yeah.
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:34.540]   And I know, you know, I, I still have kind of a fetish for audio stuff.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:35.540]   I probably should.
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:36.540]   I do.
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:37.540]   It's a very expensive fetish.
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:38.540]   It's a bad habit.
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:39.540]   I won't.
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:41.220]   I won't recommend the other one that we think is really cool, which was the, well, I will
[01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:43.820]   recommend it, but I will not say that everyone should have one.
[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:51.740]   We bought a cedar, a cedar, a DNS eight, which is not above what I'd recommend because
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:57.100]   it starts to get into, you know, a cheap car, but it just removes all the echo and all
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:58.820]   the noise around you.
[01:58:58.820 --> 01:58:59.820]   And it's.
[01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:00.820]   Ooh.
[01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:03.180]   I can't see this 700 bucks Amazon Prime.
[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:04.180]   That's a 16.
[01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:05.180]   No, there's 12.
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:06.660]   I could get a 12, which would be like two 50.
[01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:07.660]   Yeah.
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:08.660]   Two hundred fifty bucks.
[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:09.660]   Is that the same?
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:10.660]   It's the same interface.
[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:11.660]   Just 12 inputs, less outputs.
[01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:15.020]   Well, so I only has looks like four mic inputs.
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:16.020]   Yeah, four mic inputs.
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:17.020]   So it's a little short.
[01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:19.460]   And then there's, there's a, there's also a six point four.
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:21.260]   Don't buy anything Leo.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:24.380]   How often do I hear that?
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:25.380]   Don't buy anything Leo.
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:35.100]   But I want the Duke and style auto mixing.
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:36.860]   It's revolutionary.
[01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:37.860]   It is.
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:41.300]   And I've bought everything so far on the show.
[01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:42.540]   Every pic you can have.
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:44.260]   Like you go a hundred percent.
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:45.260]   But there's a 16.
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:46.260]   Look at the XR 16.
[01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:47.260]   It's only two hundred fifteen bucks.
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:48.260]   Look at the XR 16.
[01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:50.980]   The 16 is better because it's just it's between the two.
[01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:53.380]   So if the 12 doesn't have quite enough mic inputs like for.
[01:59:53.380 --> 01:59:55.540]   Oh, this is only four hundred for the 16.
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:56.540]   And now you have, I think.
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:57.540]   Money is that.
[01:59:57.540 --> 01:59:58.540]   Oh, look at that.
[01:59:58.540 --> 01:59:59.540]   That's eight.
[01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:00.540]   No.
[02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:01.540]   Yeah, eight.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:02.540]   Eight mic inputs there.
[02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:03.540]   And then ox inputs.
[02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:05.740]   And then if you had a, could you mix a band with this?
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:06.740]   Yeah, you could.
[02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:07.740]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:10.420]   See, this is what we need when we have live studio.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:11.420]   Don't we?
[02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:13.220]   Absolutely.
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:16.220]   So why did you say don't get it?
[02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:17.220]   Because you want to get it.
[02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:18.220]   Amazon Prime, right?
[02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:20.860]   We can buy it a week before we need it.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.180]   It is Amazon Prime for a hundred dollars.
[02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:26.140]   But now we could get used to it and I could play with it at home.
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:27.140]   It's great.
[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:28.140]   Sold.
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:30.140]   All right, I've now bought everything you guys pick.
[02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:31.140]   So stop it.
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:33.100]   Knock it off.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:34.100]   You want a bicycle?
[02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:35.100]   Yes.
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:37.420]   I already have a trick.
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:38.420]   Thank you very much.
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:39.420]   Andy, you're not go.
[02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:42.900]   He's with the Chicago Sun times and CWOB.com.
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:45.220]   And he's the greatest.
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:46.220]   Thank you very much.
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:49.300]   Nice to see you here once again with that beautiful light.
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:51.140]   Oh, I really see.
[02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:52.140]   Wow.
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:53.580]   That's just a single loom cube.
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:54.580]   That's two, isn't it?
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:55.580]   Or is it one?
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:56.580]   Oh, towards the light.
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:58.380]   Is it one or two, Andy?
[02:00:58.380 --> 02:00:59.380]   Oh, you're welcome.
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:00.380]   This is just one.
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:06.460]   I think I saw a picture of the prototype that they showed off for a GoPro.
[02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:11.140]   And that light had actually four elements inside it.
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:15.980]   It's again, 1500 K. So boy, that's a lot of light from one LED.
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:19.100]   But you think it's just one of them and you can give them in gangs.
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:20.100]   Very nice.
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:23.980]   And Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:26.460]   We got you off just in time.
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:30.020]   The email should be going on any minute now for the press release.
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:31.020]   Yep.
[02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:33.260]   I have a telegram bot.
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:35.780]   It's the Apple PR bot.
[02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:36.620]   It's so awesome.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:42.140]   I get a telegram message on my messenger whenever Apple and that's issues of PR release.
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:43.140]   Did you do?
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:44.140]   Yeah.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:45.140]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:46.140]   It's actually pretty cool.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:47.140]   It's telegram?
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:50.380]   We've talked about this.
[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:53.620]   So it's called Apple PR bot.
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:56.620]   And you just follow it at Apple PR bot.
[02:01:56.620 --> 02:01:58.500]   You actually get better bots.
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:01.580]   We've got the guys write bots for Slack all the time in the company.
[02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:04.220]   I don't quite understand it, but it's great.
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:05.220]   Bots are great.
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:06.220]   Yeah.
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:07.220]   Really aren't great.
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:08.220]   That's Alex Lindsey.
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:09.580]   He's from the Pixelcore.
[02:02:09.580 --> 02:02:10.580]   Pixelcore.com.
[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:12.220]   And next week we'll talk about what Apple announced.
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:14.660]   That's just how we'll have to do it because we can't stick around all day.
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:17.900]   We've got a show to do, "Security and House" coming up next.
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:18.900]   Thanks for being here, everybody.
[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:26.420]   We do Mac break weekly 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time, 1900 UTC on twit.tv.
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:28.980]   Now that the site's back up, you can watch live there.
[02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:33.420]   Remember your backup site is always live.twit.tv, just a little hint word to the wise.
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:35.940]   We kept the old live stream up just in case.
[02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:37.860]   And I'm glad we did.
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:39.460]   Glad we did.
[02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:41.060]   You can also subscribe.
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:42.460]   That's a good way to get it.
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:48.140]   And now on the Apple TV and the podcast app or anywhere you get podcatchers, Stitcher,
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:51.220]   Slacker, Spotify, Spotify just added a video.
[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:54.100]   I have had it for a while, but apparently some people are just getting it.
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:55.100]   They're making it more prominent.
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:56.100]   Yeah.
[02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:57.660]   And it's good.
[02:02:57.660 --> 02:02:59.460]   Watch please every week in that way.
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:00.780]   You won't miss a minute.
[02:03:00.780 --> 02:03:01.780]   Thanks for joining us now.
[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:03.620]   Get back to work because you know what, break time?
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:05.860]   Bye bye.
