[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Hello, John.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   John's talked a lot about this DRM issue, and you posted
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   this morning about the announcement.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   What did Apple and EMI announce, John?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Well, I think the short version is that they've announced
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.960]   that EMI is making their, I think, their entire catalog
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.960]   of the content available, DRM-free on multiple stores,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   but starting with the iTunes Music Store in May.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   And the deal is they're not getting rid of the DRM.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.960]   They're offering a new way of obtaining the music,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   which is double the encoding quality.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.960]   And without any DRM protection, and instead of 99 cents a song,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   it's going to $1.29 a song.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   And then the old 99 centa song DRM, old encoding level,
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   the audio will still be available.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.960]   People will get to choose.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   So for 30 cents more, I can get unprotected super high quality.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   And I think that also if you order an album, you get the 256.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   Right.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.960]   And then the new, you know, buy an album and it defaults
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.960]   to the new quality and the price is the same as it used to be,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   you know, for whatever the album was to delete.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   So I immediately ran to the iTunes Store to get the latest craft work
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   and spend out ballet albums, because, you know,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   I'm big on the Euro synth pop.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   You love your crop rock.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   Crap rock.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   And no, still the same 99 cents for 128K encrypted.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   So when does this going to happen?
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   May is what I'm saying today.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   I guess I have to re-rip everything.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   I don't know.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.960]   Here's a little bit of Steve Jobs at the EMI announcement.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   You know, there was a, it begins with some music and some announcements
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   and so forth, but about 18 minutes in, Steve Jobs comes to the stage.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   Please welcome Steve Jobs.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   [applause]
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   Since it's not encrypted, I presume I can play this.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   [applause]
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   It's actually available from the EMI site.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.960]   I just wrote down a few things I wanted to say,
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   and then I think we're going to answer questions, right?
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   So today, EMI and Apple are announcing, I think, the big,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   the next big step forward in the digital music revolution,
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   the movement to completely interoperable DRM-free music.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   And EMI is the first of the big four music companies to take this step
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   and their entire digital music catalog will be available DRM-free on iTunes in May.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.960]   Today, we offer more than five million songs on iTunes for 99 cents,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   99 Euro cents or 79 pence.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   They all have DRM, right?
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   Digital rights management.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   And they're all encoded in 128 kilobits per second AAC.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   iTunes has sold over two and a half million songs to date,
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   earning the music companies over a billion and a half dollars in revenues.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960]   Two and a half million songs?
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   Is that right?
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   Isn't it more like a billion?
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   What is he talking about?
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   Is that the total number of titles available?
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   Maybe it's 10 to say they're--
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   I think he made a mistake.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.960]   Should we continue on?
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   Is he going to say anything of interest?
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   Let's see.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.960]   By the way, still wearing the trademark black turtleneck and jeans.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   I just want to let you know.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   And looking mighty fine.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.960]   Factoring costs, no product returns, no marketing fees or other costs like those
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   associated with distributing physical CDs.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.960]   Oh, is he rubbing it in for EMI?
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   Geez.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   That's almost mean.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   It's all worked out very well for music lovers, for the music companies, and for Apple.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.960]   To take things to the next level, we need to address two issues.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   The first is interoperability.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   Although most users have never bumped up against the DRM, the music they have bought from iTunes
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.960]   will not play on portable music players other than iPods, unless they burn it onto a CD
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.960]   and then read that CD back into the computer.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   So it's no coincidence he's doing this in the EU since I think this is partly a response to the EU's.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.960]   You know, Norway and France saying,
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.960]   "We don't want this.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.960]   We want interoperability."
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.960]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   I think it's weird listening to it.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   I feel like he sounds like he's a little bit less rehearsed than usual.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.960]   The beginning was a little rough and it sounds to me like he's reading a little bit more than usual.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   And it also raises the question.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   And it's been in my mind since yesterday when the press release first went out that they were going to do this.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   It's a little weird that it was announced on a Sunday afternoon the day before it happened.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.960]   It seems like this was pretty -- this must have gone right up to the last minute and they wanted to announce it immediately.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.960]   It is odd.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   You know, it doesn't seem to me -- I mean, it seems to me like if they knew they were going to do this on Friday,
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   they would have at least announced it on Friday.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.960]   But remember, the rumor almost immediately after Jobs' thoughts on music came out.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.960]   The rumor was that EMI was going to do this almost immediately.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.960]   There was some noise coming out of EMI that they were thinking about it.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   Do you think it was the issues of price?
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   I'll bet that that was definitely part of the negotiations.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   I mean, I definitely think that this is sort of -- I mean, I think it's a cliche, but to say that it's a win-win for everybody.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.960]   I mean, it's pretty close.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.960]   I mean, I think Apple ultimately probably wanted to keep 99 cent per single pricing regardless of --
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   The label's in this.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   -- pushing him hard to have very pricing on iTunes.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   Right.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   And so I think that this $1.29 percent or personal pricing for these files, which I think anybody would say,
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.960]   twice the encoding quality and no DRM is certainly a good deal.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   Yeah, that's the part that really surprised me was -- I mean, we've been hearing so much about the DRM part of this for so long,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   but I mean, the part that's going to mean a lot more for the average quality,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.960]   there's so many people who have -- if you ask people the two reasons,
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.960]   the reasons that almost everybody says they don't buy from iTunes,
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   for the geeks, a lot of them it's the DRM, but for the audio files, it's the sound quality.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.960]   They really hear a difference.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   And I think absolutely for $0.30 more, that's totally worth it.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   Yeah, and I think that even if you're not in an audio geek,
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.960]   it's the fact that they've gone all the way from 128 kilobits per second to 256 double.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   That double is a good word that even if you don't really know what that sounds like,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   you know, you're getting double the quality for $0.30 more.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   It just seems like even if you're not really into it, don't even know exactly what it means,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.960]   it seems like, yeah, $0.30, what the heck?
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.960]   Yeah, and I think that for me, I mean, these are the two big reasons that I still buy CDs when I buy them.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   You know, if I really want something that I'm going to keep, you know, that I really like
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.960]   and I'm really going to keep for a long time, the two things that have stopped me from getting them from Apple iTunes.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.960]   I buy a lot from iTunes, but what keeps me from doing it is A, I want a higher quality than 128 and B,
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   I don't want to have DRM.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   I don't want to go through the process of stripping the DRM if I get it.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   256 has to be, 256 has to be pretty close to CD quality.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   Yeah, what is so e-music?
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   They're doing a Fermi serves 192. Is that right? They're doing pretty?
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   But yeah, exactly MP3. So there's going to be...
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   This is far better than that.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   Yeah, this is pretty close to CD quality, right?
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   Yeah, I'd say that actually my guess is, because I think that AAC generally does a better job than MP3,
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.960]   you know, as far as the compression process is supposed to.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   It's the successor to MP3.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   Yeah, I think you're definitely, I think at this point you're definitely within the range where most people actually,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   you know, really could not distinguish it.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.960]   No, I couldn't. My ears are not, I do not have terrific ears for that sort of thing.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.960]   You mentioned on the, during Fireball that there's an upgrade too.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.960]   If I've already bought all my Beastie Boys music, I can pay to upgrade.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   How are they going to do that?
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   I guess that there'll be some sort of, you know, I guess, I mean, almost certainly an iTunes update, you know,
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   iTunes 7.2, let's say, I mean, who knows what the version number will be.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   If you're missing, then you'll be able to go to your purchased music source in your library,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   and then for all of the tracks which are now available in the new format,
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   there will be, I'm guessing, an upgrade button next to each one in your list.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.960]   So there'll be a new, a new version of iTunes to do this.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.960]   I would, I would think so, yeah.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   There's an interesting side benefit of this.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   So a conversation we had a few months ago was, you know, what do you do if, over time and just carelessness,
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.960]   you've lost some of your original tracks?
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.960]   And you mentioned, yeah, you mentioned you had that kind of back door where you, you know, got them.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.960]   It's been known for a while that if you ask nice, they'll give you a one-time exemption,
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   but I wonder if you still have to have the actual file on your drive, or if it's just relying on your purchase records.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   Because in that case, it's great.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.960]   You can basically just refill your whole hard drive, even with stuff you've lost.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.960]   Yeah, I wonder, you know, and for example, yeah, I wonder if it's based on your purchase history or what songs you have,
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   for example, let's say I have a song in my iTunes that my wife purchased, which I have as part of our five computer friends and family list.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   Will I be able to upgrade that one?
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   I have quite a few.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   No, they're relying so heavily right now.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   If you look at the way things have changed on the actual store, you're using more and more of that previous purchase information for different kinds of stuff.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   So I'll bet it's going to be your account.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   Because I have to say that, yeah, I'm guessing you're right because it makes more sense.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.960]   Although it's going to be a pain for me because I actually, you know, we don't have a ton of iTunes songs.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   It's mostly just singles, you know, just like, hey, you know, let's get that song.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   But I have to say that I don't even remember which ones I bought, which ones my wife bought.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   Now remember, this is only EMI, although the EMI artist list is quite long.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.960]   I went to capitalmusic.co.uk and they've got a list there.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   And I'm going to do the oldies because I'm an old guy.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   Merlin, you could pick out some of the newer bands, but it's Pink Floyd.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.960]   It's the band.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   It's the Beatles, David Bowie, John Cale, Coldplay.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   That means Duran Duran.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   There's some cool...
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.960]   Coldplay is oldies?
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.960]   Well, I'm going to call them oldies for my benefit.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   Nora Jones, Crot, Vuk.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.960]   Of course, all the McCartney and Wing stuff.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   Queen, radio head.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.960]   Well, our stones?
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.960]   My ear, EMI is not a...
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   I mean, I know they're a major label.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.960]   They're the smallest of the majors, but you know, it's a lot of their subsidiaries that
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.960]   they've kind of gobbled up over the years and other names that we night.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.960]   It looks like people like the Decemberus and Elvis Costello and the band and all these...
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   It's kind of mind-blowing.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   Is Elvis Costello on here too?
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.960]   That's great.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.960]   Well, he would have been, he was on stiff and then he was on...
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   I don't know how...
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.960]   You have to get a family tree to figure all this stuff out.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.960]   I mean, I think when you say things like Pink Floyd, I mentioned this on 43 folders as well.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.960]   I don't know, you know, how label changes over the years affect that.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.960]   I think Bowie was mostly with EMI.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   Yeah, would it be...
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   It wouldn't be the most...
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.960]   Exactly.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.960]   It's going to be whatever.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.960]   Yeah, and whatever.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   And I think even the Stones had some records on EMI, but it's, you know, it's no doubt.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.960]   It's going to be considerable.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.960]   I mean, even if there's like, picked up a figure here off the Wikipedia that EMI in 2005 had
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.960]   about 18% of the U.S. sales.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.960]   Well, and don't you think that even more to the point that once...
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   Now that this has happened, it's intense pressure on everybody else to do the same thing.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.960]   Yeah, it's the crack.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   Yeah, maybe by May, it'll all be unprotected.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   Correct that by the way, I meant 9%.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   I think I got that.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   Okay.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   That's bad wrong.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   Sorry.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.960]   It's interesting because it's...
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   The crack in the, you know, in the ice, you know, so to speak, it's really hard for the other labels to hold the line.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.960]   And Apple's given them an incentive to go up to get make a little bit more money if they move up just a little bit.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   Go ahead, John.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   It's a brand separator.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   It's a brand separator for EMI now.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.960]   Because I mean, just like, you know, I'm with you guys.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.960]   I mean, for most of the music, I know, I mean, I don't really know what record label a lot of the people, you know, the artists I like are on.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.960]   Whereas all of a sudden, you know, now it's like everybody, you know, I want to know who's on EMI.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.960]   You know, I'm more interested, you know, I mean, even just the novelty factor when it first comes out.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   I mean, I'm going to buy something.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.960]   The real question is you point out on your blog.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   The real question is you point out on your blog is if the, will EMI sales go up or down?
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.960]   Right.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.960]   I think they've got to go up.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   It's certainly short term they're going to go up.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   Well, they basically have been putting stuff on a high shelf that nobody can get to.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   I mean, that's not entirely true.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   If you're willing to have the DRM, it may not make a huge difference.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   Personally, I think, you know, again, going back to that same stat, independent labels all combined have about twice the market share in the United States of EMI.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.960]   So if you put them all together.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.960]   Well, I can understand that's a very, very long tail.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   But I think that's what's going to be fascinating is all these artists who've kind of held off and kind of sort of said, okay, well, we'll put it on iTunes, you know, just to have it there.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   But I don't think they're promoting it as heavily.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   A lot of artists really hate the low sound quality and really hate the DRM.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:37.960]   And I could just see, if they can figure out a way to cut these deals fast, I could see a lot of independent artists galloping into iTunes.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.960]   I think jobs goes on to offer the same deal to, let's listen a little bit more.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   It is interoperable, but it's a little bit of a hassle.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   He's again talking about the interop...
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   Even though users may not want to play their music on devices other than iPods today, they want to know that they have that choice in the future.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.960]   The second issue for some users is audio quality.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   While the current 128 kilobits per second AAC encoding is the best audio quality offered by any mainstream digital music store, audio files can still tell the difference between it and the original source material.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   As portable music players have increased their storage while at the same time coming down in price, it is time to reconsider delivering even higher audio quality than is currently available.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   We are going to address both of these issues by introducing new versions of our songs and albums that will be sold alongside our existing versions.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   The new versions will be DRM free so that they are completely interoperable and they will be encoded in 256 kilobits per second AAC for audio quality that is virtually indistinguishable from the original source material.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   The new versions offering these added values will be priced at $1.29 per song.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   What about Pence and euros?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   Thank you.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   Our sampling of users indicates that the vast majority of them will pay the additional 30 cents for the superior audio quality and the safety net of interoperability.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   iTunes will let users choose to automatically buy these new DRM free versions whenever they are available so that users won't need to think about it on a song-by-song basis.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   iTunes will offer EMI's entire catalog of music including all songs, albums and music videos in the new DRM free versions starting next month.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   Worldwide, in addition iTunes customers will be able to easily upgrade their entire library of previously purchased EMI songs and albums to the higher quality DRM free versions for just 30 cents a song.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.960]   We think customers are going to really appreciate this.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   Also, iTunes will offer the new DRM free versions of EMI albums at the same prices as the current DRM protected versions so customers can elect to purchase the DRM free albums with even higher audio quality for the same price.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   Now users that come off of it.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.960]   Wait a minute, I'm confused.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   What did he just say?
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.960]   That was confusing to me.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.960]   Does that mean that I get the lower quality?
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   That's pretty cool.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.960]   The lower quality is also DRM free?
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   No, what it means is that if you want to buy a single you can pick between 99 cents with DRM, same as before, or a dollar or 29 for a higher quality no DRM.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.960]   But if you want to buy the whole album you can get it for the exact same price, typically $9.99.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   And you can just for the same price $9.99 you'll get the higher quality DRM free.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   So it's only singles that cost more.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960]   The CD cost is the same.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   Oh, that's great.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.960]   Wow.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   That's great.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   Yeah, this brings us back to the record companies that wanted to create an incentive for people to go back to buying albums because it's been, you know, that's a big chunk.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   You know, the wheat one, all the twenty, because it's twelve crappy songs with one good song.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   When I worked for Sony, I mean the typical thing was that if you listen to a new CD from a new band and as long as they had three singles on it we figured people would probably buy, you know, once they heard three hits they probably buy the album instead.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   And so they needed three or four good songs and the rest of it. And the truth is, is that people who are really into the band will enjoy at least eight of the tracks.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:31.960]   But they obviously there was a huge margin, a much larger margin for them in the and more money, obviously a bundled deal basically to get people to buy an album.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   And iTunes has been just stripping us to the ground, you know, and so giving people more of an incentive to go for an album is going to be a big deal I think for EMI and for other record companies.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   They start to jump into this.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:55.960]   I bet you see you're going to see that on best ofs and greatest hits where if you go in there and you go, okay, do I want really want I want candy and low resolution for a dollar twenty nine or do I want all the best about wow wow for like seven or eight bucks more.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   No, seriously, this is how people buy you have a couple drinks you go out and you start downloading the songs of your youth.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   I think that's I think that incentive of having that, you know, I didn't realize that it was going to be still ten bucks to do that.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.960]   That's I think that's that's pretty much what albums have always been variably priced.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   And like greatest hits albums are often more than nine ninety nine but whatever but in other words he's saying, no, whatever the price used to be for the album, it's the same price but you get the better songs.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.960]   But I mean, also you get that thing where sometimes you get a lot more than ten songs on some of these records just to the other side of that.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.960]   Right.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   You know what I mean? There's a lot of them, especially on back catalog and this is why I think stuff like people like Universal and Sony, my God, you know, they've got to come around to this.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   This is the whole point. Again, I'm going to use this. I'm going to go through this month and next month's usage of the term long tail.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   But that's the whole point of that. If there's anything to that is the idea that this stuff's just sitting around on a server.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   It doesn't cost you anything to have it up there. You might as well be moving it.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.960]   And if you can move twenty of them instead of one, you're going to be a lot better off.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.960]   One I think that the other thing is is that this really short circuits a lot of the arguments and the EU.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.960]   It's a lot of the arguments of the record companies. It just it had you know, apples now called their bluff.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   You know, he said that they basically said, "Yep, we really mean this. We really are going to go down this path."
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   And I think that that's going to make it really complicated for anyone trying to change anything else significantly.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   I think that this it really is going to matter. I think I think the other record labels are not going to get on board with this before they see the results.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   I really do think that the executives at the other labels really do believe in DRM.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:37.960]   That they really think the reason that our sales are down industry wide is that these filthy pirates are stealing all of our music.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:47.960]   And if we could just sell everything with DRM so that no one could pirate it, that our sales would go right back up and we'd be, you know, have all the cocaine and lambergies.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:59.960]   The 80s are going to be back. The golden era of the record industry was when everybody went out and replaced the albums they'd already bought with CDs.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   They've spent 18, 19 bucks to buy all the music they already own. I mean, that's what they want everybody to do again.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:13.960]   And that's not going to happen. But I think that, you know, like you said, for us, it really just does seem like common sense.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   Like, how could they not sell more music this way than with DRM?
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   I mean, the only possible way is if there's this huge contingent of music buyers out there who are currently buying 99 cent iTunes songs but who wouldn't if they could get a copy of them from one other person who bought them.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   I mean, sure, some of these songs people are going to buy are going to end up on P2P nets. But there's already DRM free music on those networks, the sharing networks, you know, from CDs.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   For the people who are honest and who do want to pay, it just seems like there's way more of them who've been reluctant to either buy any or to buy a lot of music from iTunes because they don't want to invest a lot of money in DRM protected songs.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:16.960]   It would have been very easy for EMI to say, "We're only going to do catalog. We're not going to do our new artists. We're not going to try to avoid that problem." And I'm actually impressed that they said, "Now we're going to do everything."
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.960]   That takes a lot of good.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:25.960]   I really think it's going to make sales go up. I really think they're going to notice a significant uptick in revenue from iTunes.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:32.960]   That's why I think the Indies are going to be the ones to watch because what we're talking about here is growth. We're not talking about total sales. We're talking about growth.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   And again, back to that LT idea. But if you've got something that sits on the shelf and you sell two copies a month and suddenly you sell three copies a month, you just did something pretty amazing to your sales.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   And so having these artists out there that may not be moving huge numbers of units but getting them to stand behind this and say, "Hey, go to iTunes and buy this. You're going to get a good experience out of this."
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   Well, I think watching six months or a year of that is going to make these other majors go, "Wow, for whatever Boston and Gilbert O. Sullivan or whoever."
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.960]   There's a reason here to have this stuff out there in a way that's easier for people to snap up an album for them.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   I hear that Gilbert's into it, but Sullivan is kind of a little...
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.960]   Not into it or not. He likes to hear it.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.960]   He likes to hear it.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:20.960]   Well, I think also one of the things is that when I buy CDs, my primary place to buy CDs is Rasputin and Amoebo, which I'm buying and I'm used anyway.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:31.960]   And so the thing is, it's very rare for me to go in and pay full price, mostly because I'm spoiled with the ability to have two of the biggest used CD stores in the world within...
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.960]   I seem to remember that the record industry didn't want to allow used CD sales.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.960]   No, they didn't.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   They tried to stop that.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960]   That's totally true.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   Well, I know. It's still kind of gray market, isn't it? I mean, it's technically...
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.960]   It shows how messed up these guys are.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.960]   Sorry, I mean, that's...
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:24:02.960]   Well, I mean, the thing is, is that they're not getting any money from me now because what I do is I go to Rasputins. I buy a used one and I don't get around to taking them back to Rasputins, but I know people who buy them from Rasputins for $8 rip them and bring them back for $3.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   And to me, I'm just not ordering them.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   You have to be pretty industrious to really...
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   You have to be really madder.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   Yeah, exactly. But the point is, is that now I'm quite at $256 with no DRM.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   I'm quite happy to go just buy them on iTunes.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.960]   Now, I think that the next direction...
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   I know I've talked about this before.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:30.960]   Now, if Apple created a subscription service at $96 bit, so went down a little bit and let you just do the...
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   It's DRM. It'll play on every iPod and it's subscription service like Napster or like whatever.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:43.960]   They'd close this market off completely because I can listen to low quality ones as many as I want and I'll pay $15.20 a month.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   To listen to them.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.960]   And they're DRM'd. I can only play on my iPod, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   And if I'm an audio file or if there's one of those songs that I really like, I can buy the $256 and I pay extra for that.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   And I think that that would be...
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   I mean, Apple could totally close the market down with that kind of move.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.960]   Speaking of the iPod, I guess one speculation in the past has been they didn't do this.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   Well, the nefarious reason that people came up with for why they didn't do it was because they wanted to keep people locked in the iPod.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   So what do you think this is going to do to sales of the iPod?
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   I don't see how it hurts it in the least.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   People were...
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:26.960]   Jobs is really, I think, making a big deal out of that more to respond to the France and Norway and the EU than he is worried about iPod sales.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   I don't think it's going to make any difference at all.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   I mean, it's the old math where if you look, if you do the analysis of when Apple says we've sold...
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   What is it? Like a billion, two billion songs?
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.960]   It's still a fraction of the total songs.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   Right. The average comes out to around 20 per iPod.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:55.960]   I mean, and that average has been very, very consistent all the way back to the beginning of the iTunes store that, yes, they've sold millions and millions and millions and millions more iTunes or more iPods.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.960]   And they've sold billions of more songs.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   But the average of about 20 iTunes protected songs per iPod has been very consistent.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   And that's nothing.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   I mean, it's 20 bucks per iPod in music per average, on average.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:17.960]   The reason people are buying iPods has nothing to do with the... being locked into.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.960]   I mean, there is a lock in.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:25.960]   I mean, there's no doubt that DRM protected stuff is... there is a lock in angle to that.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   But it's not... I don't think that has nothing to do with the way Apple wants to compete with the iPods.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   I think Apple is perfectly willing to compete based solely on the merit of the gadgets.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   Yeah. And they do compete well.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   And I haven't seen it. As someone who owns, I think every version of the iPod that's out right now...
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.960]   I do. My workout one is my little man.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   You know, is my whatever, my shuffle.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   And then my nano is my travel one and my video one.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   And the thing is, I don't really see...
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   Like most people lose golf pencils.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.960]   I do lose a lot of iPods.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   I've lost a full size one like three times now.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.960]   But the thing is, is that I find that...
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.960]   If I really wanted something else, none of my stuff has DRM on it.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   I mean, that I'm really listening to. It's all from CDs. It's all there.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   If I really thought someone else was building a better MP3 player, I'd get it. I just don't.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:27.960]   Yeah, I'm not saying that Apple's anti- DRM stanza recent...
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   Recently taken anti- DRM stanza.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:38.960]   Has anything to do with being a champion for freedom and what's right in the world?
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   I mean, I think they're in it for the money.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   I think that Apple seriously believes this will help them sell more iPods.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   That it just makes it even less of a hassle to go on to iTunes and get new music to load on your iPod.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   I agree. I just wanted to ask the question because it's for so long that has been understood.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   I mean, now today we can all go, "Oh, well, of course, there's lots of iPod sales and everything's fine."
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   But has that not been what people have been saying this whole time?
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   Is that, "Oh, Steve's going to keep you locked into this, so you got to buy the iPod forever."
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   And it's a pretty interesting move.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   Maybe one thing is they've just gotten to the point where, I mean, my God, you walk into the Apple store and stocked in.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   And those things are just flying off the shelves.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   It's just unbelievable the volume of these that are still selling every day.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.960]   So, you know, maybe it is there's just less to lose now than there was a year or two ago.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.960]   All right, play the CNN music that wraps up this special edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.960]   Detailed, almost obsessive compulsive analysis of the Apple EMI announcement.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   One thing they didn't announce, by the way, is any Beatles music.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.960]   When asked about that, they said, "Yeah, that's sometime. That's going to happen."
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.960]   We're working on who? We're Beatles? We're not announcing that today anyway.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.960]   We don't feel there's a lot of demand for that.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   I wonder if they'll have it in time for the May launch of this.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   I would like to see that.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   I think they could sell a lot of Beatles music if we sold it to 256 with the RM.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   But I think there was a lot of these.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   If it coincided, boy, that would really add a lot of publicity to it.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.960]   Maybe that's the plan.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.960]   And it would really push EMI's brand.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   You know, I mean, like I said, I mean, before this, there really wasn't any reason to care about what record label doesn't such band was on.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   They're commoditized.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   Yeah. It would certainly be an EMI's interest to coincide with the big publicity push in May.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.960]   And I think it also, it might improve EMI's...
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.960]   ...when there's a sense that it really sensitive to the whole issue.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   And the fact that they're forward thinking about it may, you know, improve their negotiations in that direction as well.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   John Gruber is the blogger.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:44.960]   One of the bloggers there is, especially on Mac topics at DaringFireball.net.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   You can read his article today, all about the Apple EMI announcement.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   Merlin is, of course, the blogger at 43folders.com.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   But now he's a video podcaster too with the Merlin show at themerlinshow.com.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   New episode just came out.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   Check it out.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.960]   What's the topic today?
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   It's with Chris from Dealership and Google, which is a band and a company talking about his utter failure at email.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   And the fact that he's just simply giving up.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.960]   That's Chris Weatherman.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   It's very inspiring.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.960]   It's a very special kind of Dr. Phil moment.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960]   So a very special...
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   It's a moving, moving moment.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   On a very special, the Merlin show.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   Alex Lindsey with PixelCore.com and, of course, all the PixelCore video podcasts at PixelCore.tv.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.960]   We're going to do a...
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   We have a video of the last tweet we recorded at the GMT on Friday.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   Is that going to go up today, you think?
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.960]   It should go up today.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.960]   All right. We look forward to it.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.960]   Thank you, gentlemen.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.960]   Cue the CNN music.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.960]   That concludes this special edition.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   Matt Drake, weekly.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   We'll talk to you tomorrow with our regular show.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   Have a back day.
