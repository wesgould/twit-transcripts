[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.640]   Macworld Expo, hello everybody, Leo Leport here.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.000]   And we are ready for Macbreak Weekly Number 72,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.240]   our traditional, tear it apart postmortem after the big
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.320]   speech of Steve Jobs.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.120]   What we're going to do today, because we have many people and
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.600]   few mics, we're going to rotate people in and out starting.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.240]   But somebody who will stay here because he doesn't, more level in
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.960]   the audience and want more PA.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.080]   We may not be able to give you a lot of level because we're getting
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.720]   some feedback on this and I apologize.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.680]   We are recording this live at Macworld Expo at the podcast studio in
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.000]   the back of the West Hall.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.440]   We'll be here all week.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.600]   Right, that sounds like a joke.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.240]   We actually will be here all week.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.520]   And we hope you'll come by.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.680]   We'll be doing a number of different shows here, including
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.440]   Twitter on Friday at two o'clock.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.960]   Merlin Mann is here from 43 folders.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.080]   Hello, Merlin.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.680]   Good morning, Leo.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.960]   Did you get up and go to the big speech?
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.040]   In a sense, I stayed home and drank coffee and played with my
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.400]   daughter.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.480]   But I did reload--
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.080]   That's the sense I like, actually.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.440]   I reloaded Mac Rumors and I'm very excited.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.520]   Yeah, I was driving.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.400]   I didn't even reload.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.680]   I don't know how you did it.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.000]   It was-- I was on Tenter Hooks.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.880]   Have you ever been on Tenter Hooks?
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.760]   I briefly was on Tenter Hooks in college and then I had a
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.680]   nurse that got me off it.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.040]   It's good.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.680]   It's a nice thing.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.560]   Yeah, if you get off that.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.680]   Was it foggy?
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.120]   Crazy foggy?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.840]   Very crazy foggy.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.000]   Very crazy foggy.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.920]   They closed the San Jose airport earlier this morning.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.960]   Also here, Chris Breen, the Bufont of all Mac knowledge.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.920]   Hello, Mr. Breen.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.560]   Hello.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.000]   They've been mocking his hair a little bit, but he's
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.960]   looking good.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.160]   Booked puffy.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.520]   Yeah?
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.160]   Not only your hair, not you.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.040]   Well, I have a little of this too.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.600]   A little bulge.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   Also, you went to the keynote.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.840]   You didn't do the refresh refresh.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.640]   Yo, I know I got up, but I went to the speakers
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.600]   lounge where there was no food and no coffee.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.560]   They lied to you.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.040]   And there was a lot of cranky speakers there in the
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.960]   morning and--
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.800]   Shocking.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.400]   Shocking.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   And so as we dashed upstairs, they've had coffee
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.840]   stations.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.360]   So you'd like quick burn your mouth and then go in.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.840]   I'm going to expect you to be able to give us the full
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.680]   run out of what happened.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.240]   Before we do that though, let's introduce the
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.720]   loveliest member of the panel, the wonderful Justine
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.320]   Azerik from iJustine.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.960]   And Scott Borne leaps to his feet.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.720]   Hi, Justine.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.640]   Good to have you.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.680]   iJustine.tv, right?
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.200]   And.com.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.840]   And.com.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.560]   And that's all the same.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.000]   She's got them all, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Lifecaster.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.960]   Justine, are you going to run out and buy a MacBook Air?
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.080]   Maybe I'm going to wait maybe like two days.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.600]   I don't know.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.040]   I thought I'd wait.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.880]   Two days?
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.800]   Because you can't get it for two weeks anyway.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.240]   So if you order it, two days, you'll still get it.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.720]   Two days?
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.760]   Three days?
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.920]   I felt that way on the Kindle.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.000]   And then I started watching the clock go up, saying,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.680]   you'll be three weeks.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.840]   It'll be four weeks.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.000]   So finally, I jumped.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Chris Breen, can you just run down?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.480]   I mean, first of all, Merlin had this feeling, as did I.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   It's something exciting and wonderful and new was going
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.560]   to happen.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.480]   Were we fantasizing?
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.080]   Were we dreaming?
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.160]   Were we wrong?
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   You know, we had our panel.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.560]   We had the preview panel yesterday.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.040]   And we pretty much nailed everything that happened.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.240]   Well, everything that we said would happen unless,
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.880]   because they didn't do a new iPhone.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   They just revved the old--
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.440]   Right.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.160]   And they didn't even-- well, all they issued was the software
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.960]   update that we have seen in the video that got out.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.040]   And so there was no 16 gig iPhone.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.560]   It's just--
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.520]   No, HSDPA high speed, either.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.840]   No.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.280]   It's just like, hey, here's your iPhone.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.520]   And it's better now.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.840]   And--
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.960]   For free, that's good.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.600]   For free is good.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.040]   We'll talk about what's better in that.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   They didn't rev the iPods.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.480]   No.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.640]   They changed the firmware and the touch.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.960]   They changed the firmware and the touch.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.040]   So for $20, you can make it more like an iPhone.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.320]   Or for free, you can do the same thing.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.600]   Yeah, because you're going to do a seminar later.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   Is this free exactly the same free,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.280]   or is it like faking it with third party application?
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.640]   This is actually better than free.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.440]   You're going to make money on the upgrade?
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.640]   Yes.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.280]   Money will come pouring out of your phone.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.760]   Oh, that's a new slot they put on there.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.840]   I saw that slot.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.960]   That's the money slot.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   Well, when you check your iTunes entry on the iPhone,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.480]   you will see that your credit balance is--
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.320]   No, it's unending.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   He's un-ending.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.820]   Why?
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.400]   Anyway, we'll find out a little bit more about that.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.840]   The biggest announcement was this.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.440]   What Merlin has been fantasizing,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.920]   dreaming and hoping and praying for the three pound
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.200]   ultralight, is it all you thought it would be?
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.360]   Have you looked at the specs yet, Merlin?
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.560]   I think I wanted it to go in a different direction.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.680]   I like the thinness of it.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.400]   And that would be great for traveling around.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.280]   But Steve Jobs says it's in his notebook ever.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.620]   I don't know.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.120]   Is that the case?
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.200]   It's in an envelope.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.720]   It fits in an envelope, like a vanilla envelope?
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.840]   It's kind of envelope you circulate around an office
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.880]   with a little string.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.080]   Does it come in that envelope?
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.880]   That would be kind of cool.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.920]   It says I've got a plain brown envelope.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   And it said in two weeks.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.240]   You cross off your name and put the next guy's name on there.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.760]   That's so long.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.680]   That's exactly right.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.440]   I guess I kind of hope for Andy got me all fantasizing
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.120]   about this thing.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.760]   There'll be like half of vertical screen high,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.040]   but super small vertically, but still
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.880]   be crazy portable and light.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.840]   I think that's what I would have been more looking for.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.200]   This is pretty.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.360]   I wish it was $300 less.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.560]   It's $17.99.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.240]   That's a chunk of change.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.080]   I think it's-- well, if you look at it--
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.800]   It's not crazy, but it's not like zowie.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.040]   Like if I had seen that and it was $1,300,
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.000]   I would have been like, that's pretty cool.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.080]   But it's all right.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.160]   I'll probably buy one.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.720]   Like an idiot.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.920]   No optical drive in it, but it has a clever feature.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.360]   Chris, you were telling me where it can install
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.400]   software from any other Mac, as long as you would--
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.900]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.600]   I mean, the first thing you announce is, yes,
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.920]   you can do optical because we'll sell you
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.160]   this $99 USB little optical drive.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.920]   But who cares?
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.480]   Because really, they're saying, yeah,
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   but you don't want that.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.360]   What you want is this software that you can install on a Windows
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.240]   PC or on your Macintosh.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.440]   And you have a DVD drive in that or a media drive.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.880]   You put that media in there and you'd say, oh, could you
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.000]   go to that other computer, connect to that,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.120]   and install for me.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.920]   And the other computer says, yeah, fine.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.680]   Take over for me.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.320]   Yeah, but it's an 802.11n speed or slow.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.320]   Yeah, it's not going to be ultra speedy.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.840]   But the theme of this whole thing is it's in the air,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.720]   something's in the air.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.820]   And they're really saying it's all about wireless now,
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.720]   forget disks.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.560]   Justin, you carry a very thin lightweight
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.760]   Vio Sony notebook.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.240]   Yeah, I carry one of the Sonys.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.240]   But the thing is, I'm going to be so worried about breaking
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.840]   that that I would never want to put that in my purse.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.800]   Because I don't mind throwing my PC around.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.520]   So portability is not really a big deal for you.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.760]   Well, I mean, it is because that backpack kind of gets kind
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.440]   of heavy.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.160]   And you use that for life casting.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.640]   That's your--
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.140]   Yes.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.640]   Yes.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.440]   That's the Justin.tv, Justine.camera.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.000]   That thing.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.960]   But if you were-- so you carry that.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.280]   Do you carry a Mac with you as well?
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.720]   Yes.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.920]   And usually I actually carry two PCs, two of the small bios.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.520]   Just for backup.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520]   Just in case.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.480]   And your iPhone.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.400]   So if you could just-- would you replace your Mac
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.080]   with this new air?
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.520]   I don't know.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.720]   That would be kind of hard to do.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.520]   I just feel like--
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.520]   Really?
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.360]   What is missing that you would want on your--
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.120]   I just feel like substance.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.200]   Like I like having--
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.480]   even if the Mac was the air--
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.280]   It seems to me you're the audience for this,
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.840]   because it's elegant.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.440]   It's slim.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.560]   It's-- it fit in your purse or your vanilla envelope.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.080]   I like it.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   But if it was even smaller, like kind of like that.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.600]   Right there.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.560]   I think if they would reissue a totally tricked out
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.400]   Intel version of the 12 inch power book,
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.760]   I would be the happiest boy in the world.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.040]   That's what I really want.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.200]   I bought one of those for $500 for my wife, and I won it.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.280]   Like it's fantastic.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.600]   If the latch horn broke in, it would
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.080]   be the best computer in the world.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.040]   It's the perfect size.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.120]   And it just feels solid.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.320]   It doesn't feel like dainty.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.800]   But Merlin, how is this less than that?
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.400]   I mean, this is--
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.280]   I mean, I haven't seen the thing in the flesh yet.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.680]   I was on Muni when all this happened.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.800]   But it-- but I don't know.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.080]   But it's 13 inch screens.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.360]   That's the title of the show, by the way.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.160]   I was on Muni when this all happened.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.360]   If you live in San Francisco, you spend a lot of time
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:24.960]   stuck on Muni.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   I was on the end juda when this happened.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.640]   I don't know.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.840]   I want to go see it in the flesh.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.120]   But I think for that kind of money,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.040]   I was really hoping for something like a little more zingy.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.680]   And again, to, again, glom on to Andy, much more
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.520]   interested in how this would tie into my whole home computer
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.200]   idea.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.000]   And the whole in the air thing that got me excited was,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.640]   what can I do with this?
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.360]   There's going to be a smart technology
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.640]   that lets me not worry about the drive being only 80 gigs.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.080]   And I can, like, take a trip, hit a sync button.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.480]   Magic happens.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:52.840]   It's true.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.160]   What could you do with 80 gigs?
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.440]   I mean, my god, that's nothing these days.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.480]   So just ain't-- well, before I let you go,
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.080]   because I know you have to go and do some video.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.800]   You're shooting for this week.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.880]   You're shooting for us, Matt.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.380]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.680]   You're going to be on Mac Break all week?
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.180]   Yes.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.640]   Oh, that's so exciting, like I didn't know.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.320]   All right, so you're an iPhone crazed person.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.080]   Do the new features in the iPhone make you happy?
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.240]   I'm really upset, actually.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.680]   Why?
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.180]   What's wrong?
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.120]   I have wanted copy and paste on the iPhone.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.120]   Still no copy and paste.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.920]   I'm going to lose my mind.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.200]   You still know copy and paste.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.440]   It's great that I can make, you know,
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.720]   send multiple recipients, but--
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.400]   Will you use that?
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.880]   I don't even know why you would want--
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.720]   You know, one of that, Alex wanted that when he had a baby.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.220]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.160]   That would have been great.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.040]   That's what Alex was looking for.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.660]   Alex Lindsey and Andy and Aacore here,
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.300]   they'll join us as well as Scott born in just a little bit.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.620]   But I wanted to get the people who had to go in first.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.420]   So you're not happy with the upgrade.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.140]   I mean, I'm kind of happy.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.820]   I'm not that disappointed, but I'm still waiting for a video.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.260]   You know, that's an easy thing to do.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.580]   If you have a camera, all you have to do
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.860]   is take more pictures faster as you have video.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.220]   I tried that.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.620]   Yeah, but I mean, they could do that.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.980]   The point is they could do that in firmware.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.620]   It's like that.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.140]   It's an easy upgrade.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.340]   You know, after reading Fred Vogelstein's article on Wired,
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.840]   which I thought again, I want to plug,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.240]   because I thought it was really good.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.480]   I really got the sense that the iPhone just barely
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.000]   made its release.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.440]   And they knew that everything wasn't in there.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.320]   This was the year they had to work on it and make it better.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.120]   Sounds like they didn't get enough done in that year
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.600]   for a full year point.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.240]   I mean, it's great.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.800]   I can't wait to move my icons around,
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.200]   but that's not going to solve the issue.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.520]   What I want to copy a URL from a website.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.400]   Did you get any sense?
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.240]   I wasn't there.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.200]   So I don't know.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.280]   About third-party apps.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.320]   Do you talk about any third-party apps that are coming?
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.700]   Or do you talk about the SDK?
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.060]   He did.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.420]   He briefly mentioned it.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.060]   But it's still-- I just still feel let down.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.740]   I really do.
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.900]   I mean, I don't think it's going to be really difficult
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.820]   to top last year.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.580]   The only thing you mentioned about the SDK is he said it exists.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.900]   And he said that we're going to open up to all developers,
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.700]   which is a little bit more information than we have.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.740]   But he didn't expand on it.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.260]   He didn't show anything.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.660]   He didn't bring-- you know, drag out EA or somebody like that
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.260]   to say here.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:00.580]   You know?
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.120]   It was just SDK.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.620]   It's coming.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.840]   But let me show you the new things on the phone.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.400]   It's like this machine was made to play games.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.280]   I mean, I want to play games with my iPhone.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.700]   Why didn't he say EA come up here,
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.160]   show one great game, and say, look, we know.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.440]   And this is coming.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.400]   Didn't mean we wouldn't even--
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.960]   Well, I didn't think we were talking about this before,
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.520]   that maybe there's an iPhone event specifically designed
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.040]   for this in a while.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.480]   I'm sure that it's not an overshadow--
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.180]   It's like a very, very modest--
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.580]   --series of announcements almost by design.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.980]   I mean, what it almost seemed to do
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.900]   was to try and nip in the bud the whole jailbreak idea
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.260]   by giving you a few things that would let you trick it out.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.300]   Don't break it because we're going to make it better.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.900]   But they'd see anything must have been holding back.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.060]   Justine, thank you so much.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.020]   I want to let you go to work.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.180]   I know you've got to find some stuff to talk about.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.940]   Love that-- what do you call those things?
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.980]   Sleevelets.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.740]   I don't know.
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.740]   Sleevelets, scauntlets.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.540]   Arm warmers?
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.660]   Arm warmers.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.300]   Love socks.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:56.820]   I'm so--
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.460]   Arm socks.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.920]   She's starting a whole new trend of arm socks.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.440]   Arm socks.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.880]   Those are very, very attractive.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.640]   Thank you, Justine.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.160]   We're going to let Justine go and go to work.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.520]   And Scott Born, you can come sit in.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.960]   Andy Anaco now is miked up.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.240]   Merlin, man, you stay there.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.680]   I think we've got-- the only person who's still poor guy,
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.880]   still left out in the cold, Alex Lindsey.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.960]   But he's got knobs to turn right now.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.400]   He's busy turning knobs like a crazy man.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.880]   Scott Born, I know you're just champing at the bid.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880]   Do you agree with Justine?
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.200]   Too little on the iPhone?
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.700]   Or was this a much-needed upgrade?
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.420]   And are you glad?
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.340]   I think we needed it.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.260]   And I'm just a little disappointed we didn't get more.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.460]   I was really thinking--
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.060]   the thing I'm most disappointed in
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.780]   is one of my best sources turned out to be wrong.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.300]   So I can write him when that happens.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.460]   I was expecting a 16 gig phone today.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.340]   Well, everybody was.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.180]   Your best source was AT&T who said,
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.860]   we're going to make an HSDPA phone.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.860]   I don't know about that.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.900]   I think all the upgrades they announced were fine.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.060]   I did notice an absence of enthusiasm when he said,
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.280]   and on the touch, it's only $20.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.600]   And there was not a single smattering of applause for that.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.520]   What was that all about?
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.020]   Why?
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:02.920]   The charge of the upgrade.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.920]   The charge of the $20 to put it on the touch.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.280]   But it's free on the iPhone.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.960]   And you expect it to be free on the iPhone.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.360]   I kind of thought it'd be free on the touch.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.200]   What's the story?
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.920]   Any naga laser demo from the Chicago Sun Times?
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.360]   Well, I have to ask myself, I was this a surprise to anybody
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.520]   else to find out they're charging for that upgrade.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.320]   But when you realize that all the new features
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.620]   for the iPod Touch involve applications that are going
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.020]   to be downloaded and installed, I'm
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.780]   wondering if this is just a way for them
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.540]   to test online purchase and installation of iPod iPhone
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.620]   software via the iTunes Store.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.420]   Very interesting.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.060]   Totally.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.260]   It's a beta test.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.100]   I'm guessing they want to stress test the system.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.580]   But then why not make it $2.99 or $4.99?
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.460]   Why make it $20?
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.900]   Because there is such a thing as perceived value.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.540]   That if they make it $2.99, I think
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.020]   there are more people who feel they're being ripped off.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.460]   It was a $2.99 dollar upgrade.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.860]   Because then they'll say, well, look,
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.380]   you're charging me pennies, essentially, to Apple.
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.020]   Why you charge me?
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.820]   I think I don't know.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.820]   We're asking for your saying, well, look,
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.860]   we're giving you a mail app.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.260]   We're giving you this weather app.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.780]   We're giving you this mapping application that's just
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.820]   been revved in a huge way.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:17.220]   I was really hoping bigger memory on the touch, like a 32 gig.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.860]   Little disappointed they didn't do that.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.900]   Will there be an iPod event down the road like there was an iPhone?
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.620]   Can you guys hear me?
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.460]   You're looking at me like that.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:25.980]   I barely hear you.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.420]   I've got to read your lips a little bit.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.620]   The PA isn't very good.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.620]   So I'll come over here.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.300]   Yeah, I think there will be an iPod event.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.380]   I mean, Apple seems like they're holding stuff back
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.700]   and they're delivering it more gradually over the year
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.900]   instead of making Mac world the single big announcement.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.180]   Yeah, and I wouldn't characterize Steve Jobs as the most
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.940]   sensitive person in the world.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.980]   But I think after the iPhone price drop,
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.740]   Apple is being a little more careful about it.
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.300]   And plus I don't want to disturb the message
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.020]   around this notebook.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.900]   But I don't think after pushing really hard
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.740]   on the brand new iPods that they want to release updated
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.460]   models just a few months after they came out
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.460]   and they don't want to--
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.420]   It's pretty recent.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:05.940]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.900]   They also, if they put out too much more-- so let's say they'd
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.020]   put out that maxed out Mac Pro today, which they put out
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.100]   last week, announced-- if they put out iPods today,
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.180]   that all would have taken attention away from the Apple TV
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.180]   thing, which we haven't talked about.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.180]   Oh, let's talk about Apple TV.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.180]   And which I think is going to be a big story.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.740]   And I think they didn't-- well, I suspect they've got a lot
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.300]   to say about all of these other things, including iPhone
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.060]   and iPod.
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.660]   And I think they really wanted the story to be--
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.860]   Apple is about to change the way you think about Reynolds.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.420]   Whether that's true or not, I think that's the story they
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:34.940]   want.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.980]   But hands down, the most significant item on the keynote
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.340]   was the Apple TV Take 2.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.060]   Because that totally-- it is such a blatant power grab
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.420]   from Apple to say that we want to be the de facto server of
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.740]   purchased online digital media for everybody with an iPhone
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.380]   to an iPod.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.620]   Now they're saying we want to be the de facto Amazon store
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.580]   for digital content for everybody who owns a living room.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.420]   And to the notional mother and father that we're always
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.420]   making up, you don't even need a computer anymore.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:04.940]   Right.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:04.940]   Exactly.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.980]   I do like that.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.420]   You could lie in bed and order stuff on your Apple TV.
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.260]   200-- this is what Alex has wanted for months.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.580]   220 bucks, you set this thing up, and you're good to go.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.380]   You can buy whatever you want.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.180]   You run your credit card, and you're done.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:16.700]   I think that's--
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.260]   I have to point out that Xbox--
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.940]   I've been doing this with my Xbox 360 for some time now,
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.500]   including almost exactly the same plan,
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.220]   renting movies.
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:29.100]   You get it for 24 hours after you start watching.
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.700]   You get 30 days to watch it.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.580]   There's more expensive on the Xbox.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.700]   But it's essentially the same thing.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.900]   You could order TV shows.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.860]   I was watching Studio 60 that way.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.100]   You'd buy the TV show and come in automatically.
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.420]   So this is nothing new.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.060]   It didn't take off in Xbox.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.940]   Now, I don't know what that means.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.500]   That means that Microsoft doesn't have the iTunes store behind it.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.980]   The store makes a difference.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.060]   It's all about merchandise.
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.620]   And right now, there are a lot of companies--
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.420]   let's not say that Apple is the only company that's
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.740]   doing a good job selling content online.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.460]   Rhapsody, I think, is not getting, is not for attention
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.700]   for their subscription-based media service.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.580]   But if you want to pledge your allegiance to one service
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.540]   and have a really good chance of being
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.980]   able to find something on that store that you want to actually
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.700]   download and purchase, right now it's
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.060]   the iTunes store and nothing else.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.460]   And it's what we talked about yesterday.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.580]   The thing we were lightly bickering about.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.220]   Just now you've got this thing that plays everywhere.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.100]   So if you do have the PC and the Mac, it'll work.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.740]   If you've got the iPod, it'll work.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.460]   If you've got the iPhone, it'll work.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.220]   If you've got just the little white box on your TV, it'll work.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.300]   And that's the biggest part.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.980]   You do not need a computer.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.940]   That is what's huge.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.740]   I do think that's huge, too.
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.420]   I talk to older relatives about things like this.
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.060]   And as soon as you say computer--
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.140]   The syncing's a pain.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.140]   I mean--
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.140]   We've talked about this.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.900]   There's no difference in a Comcast cable box.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.100]   This is a set-top box.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.100]   This is a set-top box.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.300]   That's what's really interesting.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.660]   It's a still set-top box, which is what Microsoft's been
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.900]   trying to do with Xbox and never could do it.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.340]   And if you remember what we said last year,
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.660]   we talked about the Apple TV.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.180]   And you guys are a little more excited about it than I was.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.740]   I said, I think it's a great concept and a great start.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.500]   Today they delivered what I wanted.
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.300]   And today I'm contemplating replacing my $279 a month
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.180]   Comcast bill with a $229 one-time throw look at me like that
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.180]   Merlin, man.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.580]   Did you get pie out of that thing?
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.980]   What are you getting for $279?
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.980]   Isn't it amazing?
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.740]   Isn't it amazing what cable companies can't?
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.060]   It's extraordinary.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.380]   So I got to thinking I was looking at those numbers.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.740]   I could buy every freaking movie.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.820]   I think you're getting some of those way high up the numbers
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.380]   channels.
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.380]   Especially when you think about this as--
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.180]   Channel 7--
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.060]   I think you're getting some of those like the ones that
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.380]   are scrambled for me.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.860]   Imagine if Comcast were willing to give you
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.780]   all the content for free only just so that you get so addicted
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.020]   to the service that when it comes time to buy a movie,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.300]   you'll buy the movie from Comcast.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.420]   That's what Apple TV is, where they give away the podcast
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.460]   for free, they give away the video HD podcast for free.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.700]   Huge piles of content you can get without paying a single dime.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.100]   But it makes it so convenient once that alien face hugger
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.020]   egg is inside your living room to just leap on your face
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.380]   and say, yes, buy movies now.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.020]   Buy music now.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.060]   Buy mental stuff.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.020]   Cancel your Netflix.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.700]   You don't need anymore.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.780]   Buy wireless now.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:09.460]   CD is dead.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.060]   Dead, I tell you.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.260]   We're going to let Chris Breen go.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.620]   He's got to run.
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.300]   Chris, thank you so much.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.540]   Thanks for having me.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.060]   What should people come see you do at the show?
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.100]   Because you're going to be here all week.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.380]   I know.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.620]   You'll come back for a Mac break weekly, I hope later in the week.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.380]   You bet I will.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.540]   And look for him at the Mac world booth.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.060]   Oh, actually, you'll be--
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.620]   I'll be inside the Mac world booth.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.700]   So we're in the hip-heating.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.940]   But otherwise, I'm doing the iPhone Super Session Tuesday
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.380]   Wednesday.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.820]   Now people should go to that because they
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.740]   could find out how to do that upgrade for free.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.540]   That's right.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.040]   That's right.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.100]   I'm going to be right there.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.300]   Do I have to bring my iPhone?
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.800]   No.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.820]   I'll just tell you about it.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.160]   All right.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.300]   But I'll bring my iPhone just in case.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:44.740]   Take notes.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.220]   Take notes.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:45.720]   OK.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.240]   Thanks,
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.300]   for spring, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.500]   The Mac Daddy, Mac 9-1-1, and Mac World Magazine,
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.940]   and the author of a good number of books, one of which
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.060]   came in that police that they gave us as speakers.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.060]   Now, Alex, you can get on Mike if you want.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.060]   I don't know.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.140]   Alex is on, Mike.
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.020]   That's amazing.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.420]   Why don't we get-- come on up.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:02.780]   Here we go.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.340]   We got Jason.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.780]   We got-- finally got a seat for you.
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.500]   Put that on.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.140]   One of the things that I noticed about when I was watching
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.020]   the Apple TV stuff is that I--
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.580]   how many TV shows that I'm actually watching once.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.500]   And I don't really watch them over and over again.
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.860]   I'm happy to pay my $199.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:22.980]   I buy them and I own them.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.180]   But I'm not really going to--
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.220]   I don't want to keep lost.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.380]   I noticed that with the-- exactly.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.660]   With Studio 60, I bought them.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.140]   But I threw them out after I was on West Wing.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:29.620]   I bought it.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.100]   I'm on hard drive space.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.580]   And you go, I'm just going to throw it away.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.700]   Is that OK with you, Merlin?
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.820]   You seem like a kind of compulsive, anal,
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.620]   retentive kind of--
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.300]   the kind of person I might want to save every possible copy
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.140]   of the Brady Bunch.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.740]   I'm not sure I understand why it makes you feel that way.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.740]   Might be it's the notepad.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.740]   Do you have any hand sanitizer?
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.380]   No, I don't--
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.940]   Do you throw stuff out when you're done?
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.020]   Well, you know, I try to be good about kind of backing
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.140]   everything up in this sort of like, I don't have to think
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.180]   about it way, but in the smaller scheme of things,
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.940]   I'm constantly throwing stuff away.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.820]   So yes, that works for me completely.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.820]   Did you could always--
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.300]   You can't burn it from the Apple TV.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.020]   I mean, there is no way to get it out of here.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.660]   But you can put it on your iPhone, on your eye touch,
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.180]   on--
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.580]   Well, you can't think it to other devices.
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.220]   You can watch half of the movie on your computer.
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.580]   How do you get to your iPhone?
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.420]   Through iTunes?
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.060]   Through iTunes.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.180]   I think-- I'll tell you what, I think they're
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.740]   going to need to extend the time for that.
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.740]   I think in my opinion, one day is not enough.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.460]   No, I agree with you.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.020]   That's right, for sure.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.020]   I think it's going to go to three days pretty quickly.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.660]   Because if anybody tells you, well, whatever,
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.460]   I've got a 12-week old child.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:28.860]   No, you started it.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.860]   There's not a lot of times that I'm
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.140]   going to be able to watch a movie completely
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.220]   inside of 24 hours.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.660]   And I remember the Xbox.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.380]   I'm actually afraid that I--
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.580]   Well, you just closed the bathroom door.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.100]   You just put it in there.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:37.740]   No, no, no.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.220]   He just--
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.020]   I'm watching--
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:39.460]   --we know--
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.460]   versus predator.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.100]   So we have kids that are about a week apart, I think,
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:43.780]   two weeks apart.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.820]   And my son, he pretty much--
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.980]   when he falls asleep in the evening,
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.660]   there's like three losts in a row.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.300]   10 tends to be about this.
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.660]   It's baby Benadryl.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.460]   He is.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.380]   You know, it works.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.580]   It works.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:55.940]   So--
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.300]   I just don't think that's-- I don't think that's
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.380]   long after you started it.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.500]   Because it happens to me all the time.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.380]   I'll download something.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.660]   I'll watch the very beginning of it.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.500]   Something happens.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.940]   I think 72 hours would be great.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.780]   You know, to me, 72 hours is a real--
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.580]   would be a real sweet spot.
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.420]   Let me introduce Jason El-Grady, who is with the power page.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.300]   I love Jason, because he comes up with such great rumors
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:13.740]   and stories.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.660]   Jason, it's good to have you.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.300]   Come on.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.420]   Thanks a lot, Leo.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.220]   It's great to be here on the podcast.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.660]   So were you surprised?
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.540]   Did any surprises in what you saw today?
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.860]   I was surprised by the name.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.540]   Does Air bother anybody else?
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.700]   I mean, that was kind of unusual.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.700]   I did want to believe that, frankly.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.420]   I'm surprised.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.100]   I was a little-- you know, I think the sub notebook thing
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.540]   was almost a foregone conclusion.
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.220]   I've been predicting myself for, I think, 10 years now.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.420]   And last year, I knew it was going to be announced.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.820]   So I knew it would be this year.
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.340]   So you're always more--
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.940]   Yeah, one year behind.
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.340]   But I'm ecstatic about it.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.540]   But I was really blown away.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.060]   I just looked on the Apple Store, and they're charging $1,000
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.340]   more for the SSD drive.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.020]   So if you want that solid-state drive in the MacBook Air,
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.260]   it's $1,000 upgrade.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.100]   That's actually not bad, because Seekate, if you buy that 64-gig
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.940]   drive stand on, is $2,500.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.740]   It's right.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.220]   So I don't know how they're doing that.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.780]   And you're getting less storage space, right?
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.980]   It comes with an 80-gig normally.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.140]   So for a 64-gig SSD, they bang it for $1,000 right there.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.420]   I'm not going to get in line.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.060]   Who knows how long it lasts?
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.900]   What's the best fit in a last-state drive?
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.940]   There's no real specs on it.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.100]   We know it doesn't last forever.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.420]   That's the problem with solid-state,
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.220]   is that you can write to it a limited number of times.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.980]   They're doing a lot of tricky stuff
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.340]   to move the writing around, supposedly,
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.660]   to increase the lifespan.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.380]   But these drives are so no, we don't know how to--
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.700]   Set amount of duty cycles, right?
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.460]   That's the issue with it.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.940]   Is it faster?
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:32.700]   It is faster.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.660]   It's going to boot faster.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.820]   It's going to save you on battery life.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.260]   You're going to have much closer to an instant on type experiment.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.380]   Everything about it I love.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.580]   I love the concept of it.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.260]   I really, really--
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.940]   We're talking about the solid-state drive.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.620]   Solid-state drive.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.780]   What is the benefit of a solid-state drive?
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.100]   Low-moving parts for one's sake.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.060]   It's no moving parts.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.860]   It's basically the same memory that's in every iPod,
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.260]   except for the bigger ones.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:52.820]   It's flash memory.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.100]   It's flash memory.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.620]   But it has a certain amount of write cycles
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.460]   that you can write to it.
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.020]   That's the real issue.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.140]   It literally takes a lot.
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.060]   It's just too much of a premium for me.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.420]   I was a little pinched by the price.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.900]   Also, better battery life, right?
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.820]   Though, because it's static RAM, so it doesn't have to be refreshed.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:08.860]   So you're right to it.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.900]   You don't continue to send power out to it.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.380]   Yep.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.620]   And you don't lose-- so in a way, I think there's
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.620]   some advantage to this.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.380]   I mean, I think there's a ton of advantages.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.180]   Nothing is spin up.
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.180]   Absolutely generated by it.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.740]   Yep, you're going to get longer run time, faster boot time.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.580]   But you've got to remember, too, it's also smaller.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.540]   So the pad of drive that you're able to get for 80 gigs
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.340]   costs you no upgrade fee.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.580]   But if you go up to the--
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.420]   64 gigs.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.140]   SSD, you go down to 64 gigs.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.900]   Yeah, that's not a lot.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.820]   So you also have to go down.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.980]   I mean, this is for somebody who really, really needs
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.100]   to go the extra mile with that battery,
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.500]   or really just has to have the latest and greatest on their block.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.060]   I don't think it's ready for prime time.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.580]   The premium is just a little too much.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.220]   I was a little disappointed in the price.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.620]   I was really wanted it to be like Merlin.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.980]   1499, I think, was the sweet spot.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.740]   I mean, I'm walking right out to buy one immediately at 1499.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.820]   And it's sort of the way Apple kind of does everything
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.500]   with their pricing.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.940]   What do we get for 1799?
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.540]   We get a 1.6 core 2.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.860]   It's 1.6.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.100]   So it's not super fast.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:06.940]   13 inch screen.
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.540]   Full size key.
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.060]   But it's an LED lid, right?
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:09.900]   LED backlit.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.700]   Now, Scott, you're a photographer.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.780]   I know a lot of my graphic artist friends
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.780]   say the LED backlit is actually a better color rendition.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.620]   Is that correct?
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:18.880]   It is.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.300]   It's going to do a better job for people
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.620]   to use it on a rimiter.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.860]   Is it brighter?
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.020]   It's very bright.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.900]   And it's really very, very even.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.140]   It's very bright, particularly considering the battery
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.460]   power it requires compared to other traditional methods.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.100]   I think the big news is it's--
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.380]   we all heard these stories about a sub-notebook.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.860]   And people were thinking like, bigger than iPhone,
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.100]   but not as big as a computer.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.140]   That's what Andy wanted.
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.860]   This is a real computer.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.020]   My question is, I mean, by the time you
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.300]   get the drive he's talking about in there,
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.300]   you're $3,700.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:48.780]   $27, yeah.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.860]   You got a MacBook Pro that'll pick butt.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.100]   I'm not sure that I understand--
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.300]   once again, I think it's a lot like Apple TV.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.900]   It's an Apple TV one.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.500]   It's a great start on some cool--
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.540]   the touch technology, all that stuff.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.020]   But in terms of practicality, other than people like me,
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.740]   who's going to buy it?
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.740]   Andy, is there touching it?
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:07.100]   Is it--
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.060]   Do the touch touch?
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.940]   Well, there are touch gestures supported by the trackpad.
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.100]   Oh, so you do it on the pad.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.340]   Right.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.060]   So that application's that support.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.260]   You can pinch and stretch the zoom in, zoom out.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.700]   There's a three-finger gesture for going from paging room
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.700]   items or other gestures.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.980]   Everybody do it with us.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:22.940]   Everybody pinch.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.940]   Look, they're all doing the pinch.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.780]   And pressing your head.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.660]   And pressing your iPhone and now an air song.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.900]   What's the air sign?
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.500]   I think that's the air-- wait a minute.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.260]   No, that's not going to-- Leo's making a big deal
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:33.940]   on his head.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.980]   What do you guys think of that five-hour battery life?
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.180]   Is it five hours, you think?
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.340]   You think it's really going to be five hours?
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.380]   It's five marketing hours.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.020]   It's five-- right.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.180]   So that's really two and a half.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.140]   It's a half for $2,500.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.940]   Five marketing hours.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.580]   I'm in marketing.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.020]   So if you're only writing press releases,
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.020]   it'll go for a whole hour.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.220]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.700]   Three screen hours in human data.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.260]   I'll wait with the screen all the way down.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:50.740]   Off.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.740]   No, off.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.540]   Like you're typing.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.340]   I think I'm typing.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.260]   But potentially it could be because it is so much smaller.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.500]   There's a fewer spindles.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.700]   It could potentially have--
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.100]   I wouldn't say that--
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.700]   I would have to think that it's less than five.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.620]   I wouldn't say that it's less than four.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.300]   It's got to be more than a MacBook.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.100]   I'm guessing four.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:06.940]   Oh, definitely more.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.060]   I would guess four and a half.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.180]   Well, more than an hour and a half you get off a Sony.
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:10.860]   That's true.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.940]   And they are getting better at battery predictions.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.220]   There used to be a date, honestly, when it was 50%
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.380]   of whatever they said.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.980]   It comes with a six-hour battery, right?
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.580]   If you were getting three, man, you had the dimness
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.180]   all the way down, energy saver cranked up.
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.460]   They're getting closer to the mark.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.460]   So I think she gets four.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.300]   I'll also realize this is like a MacBook
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:32.420]   built with iPod engineering, where it's got iPod hard drives,
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.820]   got iPod display technology.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.460]   Oh, is it really that?
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.220]   It's that little Hitachi's drive way in.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.420]   One way in Hitachi.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.860]   Oh, interesting.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.660]   I actually want to get back to the question
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.580]   that Scott was asking about who would possibly buy this.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.660]   And what really kind of put into focus for me
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.620]   is thinking about the Concorde, the supersonic,
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.500]   transatlantic flights, where for an extra $1,000,
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.500]   you could be in London in two and a half hours
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.900]   instead of six hours.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.620]   But there were enough people for whom that three and a half
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.500]   hour dis-reference was so important
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.460]   that they could actually keep the fleet going.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.460]   That's what they should have needed.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.020]   The MacBook Concorde.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.620]   There you go.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.900]   Before the tire problem and the people die.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.740]   Yeah, the MacBooks don't cost.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.780]   See, we were talking earlier about how much
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.700]   a lot of us missed the 12-inch MacBook, the 12-inch power
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.180]   book.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.500]   But the thing is, people are not carrying around 12-inch wide
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:20.980]   bags.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.300]   They're carrying around bags that are about this size.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.140]   So if you were to make a notebook that's narrower,
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.420]   I wouldn't see any practical benefit from it.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.460]   However, if you make it thinner, that
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.780]   means that I don't have to jam it in there to get it in there
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.460]   with my other notebook, with the book,
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.420]   with the legal path I've got in there.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.020]   Do you fly Coach?
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:39.780]   Yes, I do.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.860]   I'm a freelance double-flood journalist.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.780]   When I had that.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.540]   I fly Coach.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.140]   You know, there's some things missing from this.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.140]   I have to point out, not only did optical drive,
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.700]   but Dan Hendricks, who's sitting in the audience,
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.420]   was just showing us a cue card on his 17-inch, I think.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.540]   It was big enough we could see it.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.620]   He said, no ethernet port.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.780]   That's kind of a shock.
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.700]   ethernet is dead.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.620]   They're really declaring--
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.220]   I mean, Apple is really saying wireless is wireless is
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.060]   wireless, and we're not--
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.380]   And now I have a question.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.580]   How often do you guys hook your laptops into an ethernet?
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.140]   All the time.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:08.820]   Every day.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.300]   Every day.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.300]   OK, well, there you go.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.740]   Also, is this the fastest--
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.540]   I forgot that mine had an ethernet port.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:14.420]   No, use it.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.980]   Also, it's the simplest way to get two max talking
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.780]   to each other at the sort of speeds
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.500]   where location is irrelevant.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.780]   There are times when I could network wirelessly, where I'm
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.580]   saying, no, it's not worth copying this big file over
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.860]   or using it remotely.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.820]   Whereas if I put copper between the two,
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.420]   it's almost like I've got a USB card.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.980]   Yeah, I get you a gig at the ethernet.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:32.740]   So it's a large--
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.020]   But to finish that thought, I wasn't being sarcastic
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.460]   about the Coach thing.
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.780]   The time that one of the many times I most regretted having
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.820]   a 45-pound 17-inch power book was any time you're in Coach.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.500]   And you're on in front of you pulls it all the way back.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.420]   And you're looking at it like 17-inch, forget it.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.740]   You can't use any notebook.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.340]   And even so--
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.500]   This is no joke.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.420]   There's a reason why I bought this at a flea market.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.860]   This is portable word processor.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.220]   Because it's the only word processor
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.580]   that I can use in any airplane, any train station,
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.420]   any anything.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.060]   Right now for the home listeners,
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.220]   Andy is holding up a computer the size of a fruit pie.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.020]   It's about the size of a standard notebook keyboard
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:09.780]   folded in half.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.740]   It's smaller than his meaty man hands.
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.140]   But he still can use it.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.140]   That's the important thing.
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.780]   And manly hairy man hands.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.940]   Manly hairy.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.340]   You ladies in the live audience.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.620]   Not only do we lose some size on this thing,
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.900]   but let's talk about the loss of an optical drive
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.460]   for a second.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.700]   And this is something that's a technology
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.740]   that we've just been around for so much
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.660]   and we've relied upon.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.500]   And that's one thing that I was kind of worried about at first
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.940]   and thinking about, OK, install software.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.700]   You watch movies.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.860]   And one of the most impressive screens for me during the keynote
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.140]   was he had answers to all those questions.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.540]   OK, you can install software.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.420]   That's got to be one of the grooviest things, frankly,
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.340]   about the MacBook Air.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.180]   It's a groovy thing if it works.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.740]   I mean, you can borrow your desk.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.900]   It's a groovy thing, too.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.220]   But it doesn't work.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.500]   But I can't remember the last-- the last time
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.500]   I actually used an optical disk to install software was--
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.860]   Last night I did it.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.380]   Right.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.940]   Everything else I tend to download.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.540]   Really?
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.540]   Microsoft Office?
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.700]   What about-- I mean, like--
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.620]   But that's something I do once.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.660]   What if you heard about--
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.540]   What if you heard about--
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.420]   --two years.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.860]   If my hard drive crashes-- OK, maybe I
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.100]   didn't bring my optical drive with me.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.860]   Did I bring my copy of Microsoft Office on DVD with me?
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.500]   No, I did not.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.660]   No, actually, Andy's hard drive did crash.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.540]   My hard drive went Grandmaal's seizure yesterday.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.420]   So right now--
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:22.780]   No.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.420]   --I have two presentations on Thursday.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.620]   The only thing on my MacBook right now
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.020]   is Tiger, Safari, and text edit.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:30.540]   So--
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.820]   It'll be a good presentation.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.380]   It'll be very text edit.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.540]   What about burning disks?
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.620]   I mean, I use-- I really like being able to--
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.420]   Did you do that at home with your desktop?
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:38.920]   I do.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.820]   It's so deep.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.020]   That is a good thing.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.500]   But if you're in a hotel room and you wouldn't have a backup,
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.460]   you want to make a CD to listen to in the rental car.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.220]   You do it right there.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.340]   I burn disks all the time.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.060]   OK, now I'm channeling Steve.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.660]   Steve says, connect to your iDISK on Dot Mac
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.260]   and backup to that even more reliable.
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.100]   Andy, I'll tell you what, get me started on Mac disk.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.300]   Because I would love to talk about iDISK.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.180]   Did he announce anything for Dot Mac?
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:02.700]   Any new--
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.220]   Nothing.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:03.420]   Nothing.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.580]   They announced they're not going to kill it.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.700]   I hope they announced syncing soon.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.020]   You can now watch your photos through Apple TV over at Dot Mac.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:11.540]   That's right.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.060]   That's cool.
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.740]   So if you have--
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.300]   The Flickr didn't work so well.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.100]   And your videos, yeah.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:15.980]   Did you do it in the demo?
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.700]   Because if you drive the photo streams on Dot Mac,
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.100]   it becomes so very popular.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.940]   Well, what did he do with Alex Lindsay here, by the way,
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.620]   for the Pixel Core?
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.940]   Thank you for joining us, Alex.
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.740]   He's been turning the knobs, trying
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.820]   to make this thing sound good.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.060]   I like how he can get you on the mic.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.500]   What happened when he tried to use Flickr?
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.940]   What happened-- it looks like what happened
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.100]   was is the feed from the Flickr wasn't coming through.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.660]   The music was that was set up to play.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.660]   And it just wasn't able to grab--
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.500]   Do I need to do anything special in Flickr?
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.900]   Or can I just say, I want to see my set of pictures from--
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.460]   It should work.
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.020]   I think you can browse it, right?
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.860]   Yeah, you can browse it.
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.860]   He just blamed it on Flickr not serving it.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.860]   I do want to point out that this is the most mistakes
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.420]   I've ever seen Steve Jobs make.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.900]   Well, let's count them in a presentation.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:55.940]   How many mistakes?
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.820]   What went wrong?
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.700]   He called leopard tiger.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.860]   He said tigers loaded with great features.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.380]   Well, he looked at a graphic that said
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:06.340]   that Nokia's share was 3.1 and said 1.3.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.380]   Well, that's your full thinking, right?
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.540]   Wow, what a jerk.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.060]   A Flickr flicker.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.820]   There's so much better than he is.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.420]   That Steve Jobs is such a sad.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.660]   How could he do that?
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.980]   You know, we're so does he know.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.740]   We're so used to the flawless presentation.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.500]   And I will say that the two brave souls
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.940]   that wandered out of the stage with him this year,
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.860]   neither of them brought three by five.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.700]   No, no, you're good.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:29.260]   That's true.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:29.900]   Who did he invite up?
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.060]   Who did he invite up today?
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.140]   He invited up the studio head of Fox,
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.500]   who also dropped a second interesting bomb that
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.100]   was glossed over.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.460]   He went blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.540]   partnership, blah, blah, blah, new media, blah, blah, blah,
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.660]   quote, unquote.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.820]   Just as you're checking your watch,
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.900]   and you're starting the Sony countdown to see
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.980]   if he's going to beat the old record started
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.620]   and set two, three years ago, he takes out of his back pocket
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.300]   a copy of the brand new family guy DVD, The Star Wars Rift.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.740]   And he happens to mention that every copy of this
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.580]   Blu-ray DVD also contains a digital copy.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.140]   You can put it to your iTunes library.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.460]   Yes.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.980]   Sync to iDripod, your iPhone.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:10.900]   I like that.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.300]   And to me, this should have been one of the bullet items.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.260]   That's one of the first questions I got to ask.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.020]   The triple star question is, is this a standard feature
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.700]   you're going to find on all Fox titles?
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.140]   Wouldn't that be right?
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.660]   Are we going to see this program expand,
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.220]   or is this this one off thing?
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.500]   No, they say it's going to be normal.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.060]   Well, and one of the things I think
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:31.140]   is really important about this is this is an incredible step
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.980]   of the movie industry to legalize us.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.460]   They know that all of us want to take our DVDs
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.420]   and rip them into iTunes.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.260]   And what they're actually allowing us to say, OK,
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.500]   instead of having you do that, let's hand you
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.820]   something that actually works.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.260]   It is.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.980]   I think it's a self-defensive gesture,
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.700]   because you know that everybody's beating on the Blu-ray
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.140]   encryption to break it as candidly as the DVD
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.180]   encryption was broken.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.020]   I think they're doing a smart thing by realizing
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.980]   that if they give us what we want,
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.380]   we won't try to break the--
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.980]   Well, the Bobby Pills--
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.420]   So presumably, though, this has the iTunes DRM built into it,
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:04.700]   right?
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.260]   No, no, no.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.300]   No DRM?
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.060]   We don't know.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:07.860]   Yeah, it's got it.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.740]   I might briefly get an option to have the same quality.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.900]   No, I don't-- is it on the Blu-ray disc?
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.580]   It's on the Blu-ray disc.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.260]   It's on the Blu-ray disc.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.700]   So I think it's a standard-def movie.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.540]   The digital version.
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.340]   It would happen.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.140]   So the one in a copy isn't Blu-ray.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.860]   No, digital copy is just standard-def.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.220]   All right.
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.760]   But that's still the nose under--
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.420]   the camel's nose under the tent, in a lot of ways.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.940]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.300]   I'm surprised it doesn't have DRM.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.980]   I bet it will have DRM on it.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.860]   Oh, I would imagine.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.620]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.740]   I think all of these-- they've done this in other ways.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.300]   And I think all of these-- the idea is, yeah,
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.340]   don't keep people from ripping it by giving them something.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.620]   But we have to have some DRM on it.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.220]   We're not going to let it distribute it.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.140]   I'm not a hippie.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.060]   I don't really care about sticking it to the man.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.780]   All I-- it's like, I have the bazooka in my hand.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.140]   That all depends on how reasonable we were to be.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.140]   All I want is the girl.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.740]   You can have the arc.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.060]   So as long as I have the ability to watch it on my iPhone,
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.820]   I don't care about being able to rip it myself.
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.580]   So long as I can keep it on my home media server,
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.340]   in my iTunes library, and stream it to any system I have
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.900]   in the house, I'm happy with it.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.580]   And one other thing I wanted to throw out there
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.860]   for the panel was anybody else cheesed off
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.540]   by the dollar up charge for HD?
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.340]   Like he says, movies are $2 and $3 or whatever.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.740]   They're three and four.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.020]   But in HD, they're only a dollar more.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.860]   Like that was so--
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.020]   That sounds reasonable because when you think about how much
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.020]   more bandwidth it's going to cost--
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.540]   That's true.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.060]   --the call of an HD version out.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.420]   I ran Microsoft's--
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.900]   Microsoft charges a lot more.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.140]   The $8.99 for HD.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.980]   I almost rather it be one price, though.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.940]   It sounds better.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.380]   All the movies are $3.99.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.500]   Well, they should all be high-death, frankly.
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.180]   That's true.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.300]   And then you can make the argument that you don't get a discount.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.820]   But that just for me was kind of just like, oh.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.220]   Like the $20 iPod Touch.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.740]   One thing I think is really important, though.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:49.700]   This is the first time we're really
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:54.700]   seeing HD quality stuff being put on the Apple TV.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.460]   This is what the Apple TV was designed to do.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:56.960]   Absolutely.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.020]   And this is the first time we're getting it.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.940]   It's always been able to do it, but they
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.420]   didn't offer any content appropriate.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.460]   And now we're also looking at-- if you compare this to an HD
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.660]   DVD or a Blu-ray disc to the standard F disc,
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.660]   it's like twice as much.
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.660]   Did you guys get to--
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.140]   So we're-- it's a little bit more.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.740]   But I have to say, I really am going
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.300]   to have to love the movie or want the extras to buy a Blu-ray
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.940]   disc if I can rent it for $3.99.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.580]   How much do they rent those for in stores?
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.940]   Do they rent the same?
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.100]   I think it's the same, isn't it?
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.140]   See, that's where I think the problem is.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.940]   The problem is if I can rent it in the store for the same price.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.660]   Yeah, but you don't have to get out of bed this way.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.940]   I know, but I think it's going to--
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.220]   I think for people who are really price sensitive,
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.580]   it could be an issue.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:35.940]   And if they can't--
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:36.940]   Let me tell you something.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.180]   Nothing Apple's ever done has been for people who
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.340]   are really price sensitive.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:40.840]   That's true.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.540]   That's a good point.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.180]   Did you guys get a look at what's the interface
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.060]   like for buying?
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.620]   Really simple, really easy--
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.660]   Is it in the vein of the menu?
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.100]   It's a lot of background.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.180]   White text on top, translucent menus and stuff.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.820]   It actually looks very flat, very web 2.0.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.140]   There's no 3D parade of box art.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.940]   There's a grid that they try to maximize the background
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.500]   behind the menus as much as they possibly can,
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.340]   where they have almost like an HTML 1.3 table
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.580]   with the clickable menus.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.660]   And I think that, again, and I say this probably
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.940]   every other show is that one of the things that makes this work
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.540]   is that it's a NetApp, not a web page.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.860]   I mean, this kind of user experience,
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.420]   this kind of user experience is not--
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.140]   Do you think anybody--
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.020]   --couldn't be a machine's in a web page?
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.020]   Do you think anybody--
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.020]   But right now.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.020]   --anymore knows or cares what the difference is.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:28.540]   No.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.700]   Alex does.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.620]   It's a web page.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.700]   It's a NetApp who cares.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.260]   But the point is that we're not--
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.740]   we don't see that when we go to Amazon to download something.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.940]   We go to other ones.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.940]   It's not an app.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:38.940]   You're right.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.940]   It's a web page.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.940]   The interface is more recent.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:41.940]   One reason I'm asking is that--
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.180]   I mean, we've gone around probably half a dozen times
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.980]   about how much we love our Apple TV,
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.700]   but how much we hate the fact that it sucks at syncing.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.540]   It drives me crazy.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.820]   And it'll just stop midway through for no reason.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.980]   I'm really curious to see what could happen.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.740]   There's so many things we're talking about today
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:00.180]   that interest me because they represent a level of engagement
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.780]   into an area you hadn't gotten into before.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.500]   Whether it's putting your credit card down to add these apps,
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.660]   or, oh, gosh, now, I don't need a Mac to go do this thing.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.540]   And now I wonder, I'm always wondering
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.300]   how they're going to make this all integrate
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.380]   with the .Mac experience and that whole--
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.740]   I mean, I wonder if there's going to be a point where
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.420]   you could, hypothetically, get pulled down also
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.140]   all of your iTunes purchases that you've gotten before.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.100]   And again, they start building this into an entire media hub.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.700]   And you start thinking of this instead of going to Walmart,
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.220]   you know what?
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.420]   This is going to be my first place I check to see
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:31.980]   if they've got it.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.580]   We're going to need a bigger hard drive.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.460]   What about the streaming?
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.540]   You know, one thing he showed that I'm curious about is he
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.820]   says it starts almost instantly.
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.300]   So you're buying that high definition movie.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.180]   And you're on your generic run-of-the-mill Comcast Verizon
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.380]   connection at home.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.140]   When you click Buy, how long has that really
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.780]   going to take the stream?
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.380]   Maybe the video guys in here can find it.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.300]   I can tell you my experience from the Xbox 360, which
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.220]   does a very similar thing, it takes a while, more than a few
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:57.860]   minutes.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.740]   He said instantly.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:59.420]   Yeah, instantly--
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.700]   Did he not say instantly?
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.020]   I think when he said instantly, it was-- when he demonstrated,
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.900]   though, when he was saying instantly, I do think he was
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.060]   showing us a--
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.420]   A deeper cache.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.340]   Well, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.660]   Instantly when it's already downloaded.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.500]   No, no, no.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.700]   He was showing us a standard depth, which could come down
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.140]   as soon as possible.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.980]   The HD1 did come down very quickly, but of course, in a--
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.980]   I'm sure that he has that.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.260]   That one I've already been watching.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:21.540]   He does.
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.660]   That one of ours in watching.
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.220]   He said that?
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.220]   Yes.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.380]   Because he went to live for your diary.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.180]   So there's your--
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.900]   I'm going to go back to one of already been watching.
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.460]   There's your fudglers right there.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.540]   He said that big else.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:36.180]   And he said the standard definition would start playing.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.940]   He said, quote, within 30 seconds.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.180]   And what happens is a certain amount of the movie, enough
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:40.820]   of it downloads.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.740]   Yeah, it's buffering.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.100]   Any time I want to do anything in HD, I grab the ethernet cable
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.300]   and drag it out from the other room.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.420]   No, it'll take a while.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.580]   I can tell you exactly.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.420]   Because the Xbox Live is very, very similar.
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.820]   Takes a long time, like overnight,
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.220]   to get a high-def movie on a standard DSL line.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.420]   I mean, it's not instant.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.460]   We're talking at least a gigabyte of data, maybe more.
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.300]   So that's the trick.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.220]   See, it's 24 hours you get to view it,
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.740]   but it takes 25 to down.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.660]   It's not instant.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.020]   And I think that's really important.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.380]   Standard definition can be.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.740]   And that's what Netflix is offering.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.740]   That's what cinema now is offering.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.900]   And it doesn't look that great.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.380]   But yeah, it plays back instantly.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.980]   I think if you're watching a TV show,
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.140]   you might be content with that.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:19.780]   Podcast.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.580]   A podcast.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.300]   Absolutely would be content with that.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.820]   By the way, podcast.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:24.620]   This is a big--
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.300]   I like this.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.380]   --TV is huge for podcasts.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.500]   We're in the podcast studio here.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.540]   And it is-- I mean, being able to be sitting on your TV now
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.260]   and be able to download our shows--
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.420]   Never has it been so easy to watch
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.300]   college kids playing Super Mario Brothers on a guitar.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.780]   That is with the Apple TV.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.340]   Absolutely.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.020]   I don't know if that's going to make a difference.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.140]   But it does put podcasts in a very interesting video podcast,
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.660]   particularly in a very interesting position.
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:55.420]   If you're doing Mac break or Tiki bar or Ask An Ninja,
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.140]   you've got to be pretty happy about this.
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.100]   And he went out of his way really to highlight it, too.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.740]   He said he kept talking about how it was free
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.980]   and how there's so many 125,000 podcasts
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.700]   and all these high-def podcasts and how they're free
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.180]   and how you can order them from the television.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.460]   You don't have to have the computer connected up anymore.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.380]   But going back to Apple TV just for one second,
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.020]   he did say there's a software upgrade for the current Apple
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:19.300]   TV.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.380]   So is the new one not any new hardware in it?
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.700]   Isn't it a little faster?
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.620]   Or can the current one do all the high-definition goodness
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:27.300]   and everything?
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.300]   Or do you need to second one?
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.860]   The current one and the current one will do it.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:30.820]   Me too, firmware upgrade.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.900]   He didn't make any distinction between a first-generation
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.100]   Apple TV with the software upgrade
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.540]   and what they're selling right now.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.020]   The device that they showed on the screen
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.580]   did not differ in any way whatsoever from the first one.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.300]   So hardware-wise, we think it's the same.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.020]   We've been playing HD like Macbreak has produced an HD.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.180]   And we've been producing it and all the stuff we make.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.220]   It's always playback.
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.700]   And it always plays back just fine.
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.260]   So it should be able to handle them.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.780]   We've said a couple of times, oh, they're
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.660]   nickeling and diming.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:00.420]   But I have to say, this is pretty impressive.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.460]   What they're giving away for free in this keynote,
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.540]   free upgrades for the iPhone with a lot of functionality,
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.100]   free upgrades for the Apple TV with a lot of functionality,
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.660]   both of which they could have charged for.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.300]   I mean, I think they've done a pretty good job.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.900]   We're going to wrap this up.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.260]   Let's just get final thoughts all along the line,
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.100]   starting with you, Scott Born.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.100]   This keynote, exciting for you.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.860]   What was the highlight of it?
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.180]   Well, I have to say that as we got into it,
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.340]   it seemed a little sleepy.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.660]   But I think it's really important what
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.420]   took place with regard to the ability to download
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.580]   these movies.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.740]   I think the Apple TV is a big upgrade.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.340]   I'm glad to see the iPhone got an upgrade.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.740]   I would like to see more.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.620]   But we've got a paradigm shift happening,
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.180]   where you can download these movies.
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.580]   Apple is really starting to compete with both cable television
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.540]   and with the rental houses.
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:50.620]   I'm glad I'm not a Netflix stock owner today.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.860]   And I really think that, once again, it's
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.060]   sort of like I felt last year.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.940]   We are starting to see something that I think
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.660]   a few years from now will be really big.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.180]   And I think all of these things today, the MacBook Air,
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.580]   for instance, we talked about the $1,000 hard drive.
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:07.860]   Next year, that'll be $500.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.900]   The year after it'll be $200.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.980]   I think it's a good start.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:12.820]   I think it ended up starting slow.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.220]   It finished strong.
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:15.740]   Randy Newman was great.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.620]   And Randy Newman still came.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.660]   And I love Randy.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.660]   And it was a great show.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.900]   And I'm glad I got to see it.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.420]   What did he sing?
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.780]   He sang a song that--
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:26.620]   Toy Story.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.820]   He wrote for the occasion, which was not necessarily
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.620]   friendly to the current political administrators.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:35.340]   It was an apology to the rest of the world for our empire,
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.300]   but also pointing out that we're not nearly as bad as the
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.940]   people who used to burn witches.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.940]   Oh, that's good.
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.100]   And you've got a friend in me from Toy Story was fantastic.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.100]   Which, of course, makes our passion.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.260]   Your Steve Jobs, given his address.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:48.580]   Here it comes.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:53.020]   Now he's going to talk about the Apple TV.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.220]   He didn't say one cool thing.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.220]   You know what?
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.540]   I normally don't lack corporations that much, but Apple
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:00.260]   is different.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.260]   I like Apple.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.300]   They just gave me $150,000.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.900]   And I'm happy with that.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.860]   And I just kind of did that to make a little money.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.660]   We're going to get the rest of your thoughts.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.100]   Just a second.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.100]   I forgot to mention that this show and all our broadcast this
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.620]   week are brought to you by iStock Photo.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.180]   You've heard of iStock Photo on one.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:16.620]   I love them.
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.700]   Yeah, great company.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.700]   They're the world's highest volume image market.
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.900]   If you're a photographer and you want to sell a video
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.740]   artist and you want to sell your work, it's a great place to
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:27.300]   go.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.260]   If you're a designer or you're a manager looking for
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.860]   images or video on a budget, a great place to go.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.820]   In fact, buyers download an image from iStock Photo every
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:36.940]   1.4 seconds.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:39.740]   It means it's a chance for you to make some money on your
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:40.700]   photography.
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.700]   And if you are looking for stuff, man, the image quality
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:44.780]   and selection, unbelievable.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.260]   Two and a half million images, 60,000 videos.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.780]   They add 30,000 more videos weekly from around the world.
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:51.740]   I didn't know they do videos.
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:53.460]   This is something new for them, I guess.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.740]   Localized, by the way, so it's worldwide no matter where
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.020]   you are.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.660]   And by the way, very affordable.
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:45:59.820]   When the stock photos start--
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:00.700]   I know you probably--
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.980]   I bet you, Scott, born, you did some stock photos in your time.
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.700]   Used to be a very expensive thing, a very difficult thing
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.980]   for a photographer to get into.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.380]   And if you were buying images, very difficult to do.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.620]   Images on iStock Photo started as low as $1 for web use.
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.340]   Video clips as low as $5.
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.940]   Very, very reasonable.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.980]   And if you're doing a PowerPoint presentation or a small
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.420]   business video anywhere from $1 to $50, each image is
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.980]   inspected and improved by hand for technical quality, legal
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:27.740]   usage.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.420]   If you want to sell your photos, I want you to go to iStock Photo.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.580]   It is the biggest marketplace in the world for this kind of
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:33.140]   thing.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.300]   If you want to know more, visit iStockPhoto.com/TwitStock.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.020]   How do you like that?
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:38.660]   TwitStock.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:39.780]   That's our special--
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.820]   the fact TwitStock is also the promo code.

[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.900]   iStockPhoto.com/TwitStock, a great company.
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.260]   We're really glad to partner with them for our broadcast
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.260]   here today from a Macworld Expo.
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:03.740]   Jason O'Grady from Ogrady'sPowerPage.org.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:04.660]   What do you think?
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.100]   We're talking about the Randy Newman thing.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.420]   Anybody else think he was going to introduce Jay-Z at that
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.260]   second?
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.220]   You know, the combination of music and music videos.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:15.860]   I'm like, all right, the Jay-Z rumors coming true.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.100]   But no, he didn't disappoint.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.180]   Randy was fantastic.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.540]   I think that's a good choice, actually.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.860]   I honestly thought Jay-Z was--
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.820]   Couldn't take one more John Mayer concert.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.320]   No.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.320]   I didn't have to.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.520]   Jay-Z was coming out.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.920]   I honestly did.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.840]   I kept waiting for Paul McCartney.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.240]   But the most significant thing for me out of the keynote,
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.680]   I think the movie stuff is really incredible.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.440]   I think all the studios really got to be looking over their
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.360]   shoulders, the competitors, and things like that.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.640]   Apple's shown a lot of innovation.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.240]   But for me, it's the MacBook Air.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.960]   It's the machine I've wanted for probably 10 years.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.320]   So thin, you can shave with it.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.760]   So you're going to buy one.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.680]   I'm buying two.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.440]   He's buying two.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.720]   Yes, I'm buying two.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.480]   You're married, huh?
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.880]   You're going to need two envelopes.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.200]   That's why one for the wife.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.360]   I can't just buy one of those.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.720]   So you can hold two doors open with it?
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.760]   Yes, exactly.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.720]   Well, any machine that's so thin you can shave with is what
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.240]   I'm all about.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.480]   So you can see I'm not shaving on purpose until I get mine.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.640]   That's good.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.360]   I think it's dynamite.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.720]   I think the SSD is really expensive.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.000]   Will you buy the SSD?
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.840]   No, absolutely not.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.600]   I can't go smaller and pay another thousand.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.120]   If it was 500, I'd probably have to think about it a little
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.520]   bit more.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.400]   But I think one of you ought to, just so we know how long
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.200]   they last, and then we'll watch you and see.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.760]   But the MacBook Air is a little still weary of the name.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:25.840]   I don't know about it.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.680]   But I didn't like MacBook when it first came out either.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.560]   No, I hated Mac.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.320]   I was expecting Michael Jordan to maybe run out on stage
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.520]   and dunk the thing and do some fancy stuff.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.880]   Now that would be cool.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.560]   But I'll buy the first MacBook Pegasus I see me in Air.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.840]   Do you think they paid Nike for the right to use the word
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.040]   "air"?
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.080]   Are we going to hear a lawsuit?
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.760]   I don't think they can pad their.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.600]   Oh, you're right.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.840]   Apple probably did though.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.280]   So--
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.680]   License Air.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.280]   Very important.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.200]   Hello, we have made air.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.400]   We now own air.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.960]   I just want you to hear us have come up with our own version
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   of air.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.080]   You're on the air.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.360]   Oh, no, now we're in trouble.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.240]   Annie and Notco.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.280]   By the way, Jason, I'm so glad we could get you on the show.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:48:59.800]   Thanks for having me.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.200]   We've always wanted to have a huge friend.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.360]   Check out your podcast too.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.920]   Yeah, powerpage.org.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.440]   Thank you.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.240]   Annie and Notco, what do you think of the keynote?
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.240]   It was a--
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:09.760]   I don't know.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:14.480]   It seemed like a lot of October press events
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.640]   mushed into one big keynote.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.360]   For me, there wasn't that one big holy cow
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.240]   that Apple is not the same company it was in December.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.640]   My entire outlook on how 2008's going to go is going to change.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.240]   I think the biggest announcement that they made
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.320]   is something that was so subtle that it wasn't really
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.440]   very keynote-studdly.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.280]   Again, the idea that now Apple is definitively
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:44.000]   making a play to be the media provider of the 21st century.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.480]   Right now, they're in a position where
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.080]   they have a really aggressive majority of digital online
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:49.880]   sales.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.760]   But there's still no position where
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.880]   if they keep getting all the music publishers angry with them,
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.800]   if they start to get movie publishers angry with them,
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.240]   they could gang up on Apple and say, tell you what, Amazon,
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.480]   we're going to give you much more favorable terms
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.560]   if you act as partners that don't dictate how we can sell our music.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:11.160]   This is Apple's grab to not just be the major player in this field,
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.320]   but to be the eBay, the Amazon, the one that's so dominant
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.880]   that there's no point in trying to compete with them.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.480]   They're still two years away from making that happen.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:24.360]   But the Apple TV and the changes they've made to the iTunes store
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:30.080]   are definitely a huge leap forward in getting that goal to happen.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.040]   Andy, are you going to do any speaking on the show floor today?
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.040]   Are you just here to cover?
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.520]   Not today.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.240]   I'm going to be doing two sessions.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.480]   I'm going to be doing the live version of my iPod-fully loaded
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.680]   book on Thursday.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.800]   I'm going to be doing a game show where we're going to wait
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.000]   for it was Friday, Thursday afternoon.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   To do a call back to an earlier point,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.640]   you might ask you, but Andy, your hard drive would 100% fatal,
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.200]   and you only have two applications on it.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.920]   Where are these slides going to come from?
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.800]   And we'll find out everything.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.200]   I'm in--
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.240]   I'm in a lot of graphics and ASCII I think we're going to be doing.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.280]   You need a time capsule.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.200]   Did you-- are you FedExing your drive out?
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.360]   I mean, is there anything you can do?
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.720]   Believe it or not, I tried to figure that out.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.040]   And the difficulty of making sure someone's
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.960]   going to find that drive and get it to me by Thursday.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.240]   I would definitely be making a new set of slides anyway.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.200]   I would much rather know for a fact
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.440]   that I have the slides in, so I'm just going to redo them.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.760]   All right, great to have you, Andy.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.120]   We'll see you again on Thursday, I hope.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:26.840]   Who is the slice?
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.440]   Mr. Merlin Mann, who is also presenting this week at Mac
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.400]   Rollexpo on getting your life together.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.760]   You didn't get up like me.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.640]   You slept in.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.000]   And frankly, I'm glad I slept in.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   I don't feel like I slept in.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:39.960]   I'm totally glad I slept in.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.240]   I was dead wrong.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.560]   I really-- we were sharing an itch that there
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:45.440]   was going to be something--
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.840]   indigestion I'm thinking, something going on.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.200]   Coming down with something.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.280]   Because I-- the nothing.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.160]   No, we shouldn't.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.240]   We both thought there was going to be something totally out
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.160]   of left field.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.480]   And I don't think that happened.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.960]   I was wrong.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.120]   I'll tell you what's interesting.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.600]   Boy, that's something you don't hear a lot on podcasts.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.120]   People saying I was wrong.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.520]   I could do a whole podcast just about how wrong I am.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.400]   That's what I like about you.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   Yeah, you would be very well received, I'm sure.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.360]   I'll tell you what I do think.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.960]   I think this is a little bit like the first in a really
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.400]   interesting series of movies.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.080]   I think there's the beginnings of an arc today.
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.400]   They're going to be fun to watch over the next two years.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.760]   Maybe I'm obsessed with this.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.280]   But I keep thinking about how all these little devices fit
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.080]   together.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:29.680]   And so I want to see what happens next when this lets me
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.320]   do things indicating an iPhone.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.480]   This lets me do things on my Apple TV that are also
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.280]   pulling things off.mac.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.600]   Because I swear to God, with the groundwork that they're
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:43.160]   laying, there's so many little connections that could be made
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.320]   between all these pieces that cleave you into this world of
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:46.880]   Apple.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.000]   And that's exactly the kind of thing that they love to do.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.680]   So I think the next year will be fun to watch.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.960]   I don't know if I'm going to buy an air.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:53.800]   I don't know if I need it.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.480]   Maybe I'll just go out and try to find another 12-inch
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.800]   power book.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.760]   But I think it's going to be an exciting year.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.120]   I think you hit the nail on the head.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.160]   Although I don't think it was this year, I think Apple made
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.560]   that very clear that they wanted to own the whole universe.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.120]   They've got a very clear strategy.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.800]   It all comes around this iTunes and this ability of
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.560]   everything to talk together, becoming the single point for
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.880]   you to interact with your content.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.640]   I think this is a very clear strategy.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.680]   And Apple's been really slowly filling out the corners of
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.280]   this for the last couple of years.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.080]   Apple TV did that if you think about it.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.440]   I think they're really moving.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.320]   I agree with you 100%.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.960]   They're very much moving in that direction.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.440]   I forgot to ask you, Andy.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.400]   Do you need me to lend you an audiobook or anything?
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.080]   Because if your hard drive died, are you OK on that?
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.760]   If you got me a recommendation, if you could hook me up
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.920]   with a freebie.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.720]   I just downloaded a gently, solistic, detective
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.560]   engagement.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.040]   That is awesome.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.000]   I really want to thank you for that recommendation.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.720]   Andy's a great source of audiobooks for us.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.160]   He and I both Audible.com listeners.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.840]   We love Audible.com.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.760]   Of course, they're a sponsor.
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.720]   In fact, I just learned today that they've re-uped.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.560]   They're going to continue to sponsor the show.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.880]   So we're very glad to have them be part of Mac Break.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.520]   In fact, the Whole Twitter family.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.360]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.640]   You can go there right now.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.920]   And I'm going to have to reiterate your recommendation
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.320]   for Dirk Jettling, because I've really been enjoying that.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:10.120]   In fact, all the King's Men's also been very, very good.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.440]   You've got some good recommendations, Andy and Akka.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.600]   I want to encourage everybody.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.640]   If you're listening to podcasts, you ought
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.320]   to be listening to audiobooks.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:21.680]   And there are 45,000 plus great choices online.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.360]   It's a whole library of audiobooks.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.400]   You can download and listen to on your computer, on your iPod.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.840]   You can burn them to CDs.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.280]   It is fantastic.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.720]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.600]   We're so glad to have them be part of the Twitter family
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.440]   for another year.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:37.840]   It's a really great feeling.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.080]   I'm going to leave you the best for last, Alex Lindsey.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:40.760]   What do you think?
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.560]   You saw.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:42.040]   You came.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:42.640]   You saw.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.880]   Are you going to run off and buy?
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.840]   Because usually, you have a pre-standing order
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.480]   at the Apple Store.
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.360]   You call up the Apple Store the night before it ever seems new.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.400]   Well, let me think.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.120]   I have an iPhone, so I will upgrade it.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:55.600]   For free.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.600]   For free.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.600]   Upgrade the Apple TV.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.080]   I have an Apple TV, and I will upgrade it for free.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.560]   For free.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.680]   So far, I'm doing pretty well.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.840]   I think my wife is going to end up with an air.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.400]   Yeah, I think my wife is too.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.600]   I have to talk to her.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.960]   I don't know if she's going to want-- my wife
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.400]   tends to be very frugal, unlike me.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.040]   We're kind of the opposite of the normal.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.000]   I'm like, oh, yeah.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.520]   And she's like, I don't want to pay more than--
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.280]   so she may go for a Mac Pro.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.880]   I don't know if she really cares about the fence.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.720]   She should get air.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.960]   Or I mean, a MacBook.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.440]   A MacBook.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.800]   But I think she should get an air.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.840]   I think for research purposes, she needs to get an air.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.240]   Is that get her the solid state drive,
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.000]   which is so we could see how long it is?
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.480]   I've got to find some sucker that'll
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.280]   buy that solid state drive just to see.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.480]   But I do think it's exciting.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   I really think that the changes--
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.440]   the thing that when I saw the thing that I was most
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.520]   excited about were location on the Google Maps.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.800]   So being able to find myself--
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.520]   Call your iPhone.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.440]   --on my iPhone.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.160]   Not using GPS.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.640]   Because I'm constantly trying to figure out what--
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.440]   That's what's interesting.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.720]   To finally find yourself.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.440]   Yeah, not using GPS.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.920]   I've been trying to find myself.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   I went to India last year.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.160]   I've been to Africa a couple times.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.800]   And I finally found it here in Mac world.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.880]   And so I found myself at Mac world.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.000]   So being able to do that, I think
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.040]   I'm going to end up renting a lot of movies.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.760]   I mean, I just-- I'll probably rent a lot.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.960]   I'll be really interested because I've
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.080]   had that capability for a while.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.240]   And I don't do it.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.160]   Yeah, I don't do it.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.040]   I do Netflix.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.000]   It's easier.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.880]   It's higher quality.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:13.760]   It's faster.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.080]   I buy TV shows on iTunes.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.520]   I just don't see myself running stuff.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.520]   But we'll see.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.440]   And I do think that it's revolutionary.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.400]   I think that the--
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.640]   and this is going to be something we're
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.120]   going to be talking about all week here in the podcast studio--
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.080]   is that this is our opportunity.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.440]   When you see stuff where our podcasts are sitting right next
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.960]   to TV, there's nothing that's hard.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.200]   Now, the problem is, is that the quality of the podcasts
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.200]   have to come up.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:38.520]   So we have to start making it look like TV.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:39.240]   That's the challenge.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.240]   And if we can get closer-- now, TV right now
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.480]   is looking less and less because of the strike--
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.440]   if we can start bringing our stuff closer and closer
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.200]   to that, it's a real opportunity for us
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.160]   to take real market share.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.880]   And that's something that is very exciting, obviously,
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.240]   to me because that's my thing.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:52.680]   So--
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.440]   No, I'd agree with you.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.880]   It's a real opportunity for anybody
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.560]   who's doing their user-generated content.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.760]   You have a platform.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.080]   You have a very viable, real platform.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.280]   But the challenge is, how do we make it look good enough
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.480]   to get people to subscribe to it?
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.360]   That's going to really be--
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.240]   It's difficult to video.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.680]   I want to thank you all and the audience
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.720]   for being a great audience.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.440]   I know it's been hard to hear a little bit.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.200]   We're going to work on that PA system.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.280]   Make sure you can hear just fine.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.640]   I hope you enjoy Mac Break Weekly.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:24.120]   We'll be here all week long.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.240]   I almost feel like I said, say something about Mr. Sinatra,
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:26.840]   but I can't.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.920]   And we want to thank you for joining us.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:30.960]   Another Mac Break is broke.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:41.800]   What kind of product do you like to use when you use product?
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.120]   You know I don't use product.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.280]   You don't use any product.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.880]   No, this is purely natural.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.200]   And it's actually an expensive--
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.720]   It's just gravity and good luck.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.480]   No, it's actually-- this is not here,
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.720]   but rather it's flesh.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.160]   I'll let them wear the gross from my head
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:55.480]   and I tried to get rid of it and I just can't.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.720]   You're very fortunate.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:02.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:04.880]   (upbeat music)
