[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.360]   It's time for mmmacbreak weekly the show we cover the latest news from Apple and we are kind of in the
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.080]   In the moment, you know after all the excitement you take a deep breath
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.200]   And now you kind of reflect a cigarette have a cigarette
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.560]   Renee Richie in the post climactic mode. Hello Renee
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.880]   Hello Leo, let's look it to be back. We missed you. We missed you, but you were busy getting all the details
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880]   What you are now going to share with us
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.240]   Yes, absolutely about all the stuff Apple announced Renee was also on this week in tech on Sunday
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   It was really good to have you
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.200]   Turned out to be a more Mac issue panel than I thought Jason Snell you and then I thought well
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.840]   Well, I felt Michaels from Tom's guide because you know he could talk about other stuff turns out he was a Mac guy too, so
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.440]   It was all Mac world spread everywhere. It was okay. I have people in the chatroom going if this is gonna be all Mac
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   I'm gonna go have a sandwich
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.480]   We got to other things don't worry and Enocho's also here WGB agent Boston hello Andrew
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.440]   Hello, I thought of it more like like the when the when the circus has been in town
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.960]   And like you had a great time for the past couple days and now you're just watching them strike the tents
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.880]   Yeah, and you're like oh the elephants are going back to the real yard. Yeah, well
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:35.200]   Not this not the nackers not the nackers yard the real yard they get back on the train and they go to another town
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.520]   The car needs of all like hit the pawn shops. Yeah
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.960]   Soldiers
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.640]   Grim
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.800]   Get that get that Colt malt 40 liquor and take the tents down everybody
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:02.400]   But I think it was so Mac world I'm sorry WWDC is over for another year. I think it was a good dub dub
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.720]   I'm seeing some people saying oh I think some of it because everybody wanted to see a Mac book
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.160]   With a new channel that and we talked about this on Sunday, but actually Apple kind of oops
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.920]   Little oops somebody in the basement the guy who is responsible for creating the tags for the YouTube video for the WWDC keynote
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.400]   Didn't get the memo
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.880]   excuse me I'm down here in the amazement and I and he's adding the tags and
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.600]   Added
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   Advertently or inadvertently it's unclear
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.760]   some interesting tags m1x
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.760]   An unannounced processor
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.760]   Presumably the success of them one and even more intriguingly Mac book pro m1x
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.400]   So Renee is that a mistake or is that intentional or is it meaningless?
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.880]   I mean for all intents the purposes for us because we didn't get it
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.560]   It's meaningless, but it is a curiosity and you never know if it is somebody who's like just sitting there with his optimization tools
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.800]   Getting suggested keywords based on other videos that have wbc and then he's just like oh at all of these not realizing that SEO on YouTube
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.600]   It's completely different than it is on Google and nobody nobody cares about your dantar eggs anymore
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.640]   They just don't have really any effect on a video, but that's sort of one of those below the radar
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.680]   Screwups it could go either way
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   I
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.360]   Other people are saying the event was 15 minutes shorter than it was last year. It's a baby. Yeah, I mean if you're planning to eat
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.440]   You can use the full two hours to the to the second
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.280]   And there was only an hour 45
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.400]   There's also, you know, I wish Alex were here because last time on the last Apple event. He was the one who said there's two jump cuts
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.440]   That's where they snipped out the content. I didn't notice any jump cuts, but I wasn't looking for them Alex would have seen them
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.640]   This is by the way, it's not something I could see how you might put it in and forget it
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.800]   Because it's not something you see at the bottom of the video or anything. It's literally in the HTML
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.280]   code as a meta tag
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.840]   So clearly it's clearly not part of the way to add it like checklist. Yeah, but somebody typed it in and
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.440]   Obviously, yeah, it's not obvious anymore
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.720]   Like you like YouTube doesn't surface that anymore. They hide that you have to go press a button
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.160]   And then it says these tags are really only meant for common misspellings of words and you're gonna just like okay
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.840]   I'm gonna fill a bunch of them in anyway. Oh, that's interesting. Oh, do it for you
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.080]   Oh, that's interesting, which is my guess is like SEO tools are just still stuck on this stuff
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.480]   And what one X makes sense?
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.680]   That's what Apple did with the iPad and iPhone
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.920]   Processors the iPad's traditionally had a 14 X for instance, right?
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.280]   Yeah, I told X a 12 X. Yeah, so that would be next generation
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.640]   Well, so it wouldn't be next generation
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.720]   The numbers are the generation. Oh the way that Apple measures silicon IP
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.920]   So like a 14 is this current generation M1 is an a 14 generation chip the next generation will be M2
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.480]   Which is the same as the M1 ultra low power meant for Mac books and entry level
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.420]   Mac minis and and I and I pad pro sorry Mac book pros
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.120]   The X means it's extended so it has extra capabilities extra cores
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.400]   Extra IP like sometimes it has extra memory bandwidth
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.760]   So it's like the super sized version of the current chip. Oh, that's interesting same generation in terms of IP
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.160]   So that's something that might disappoint some people
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.840]   You know if they want a 16 inch MacBook Pro with the Apple silicon they might want an M2
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.880]   But maybe that's next year. It will be early a 15 comes out
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:45.920]   Yeah, like some time the earliest it could be a September when the a 50 generation of of our chipsets are ready because really an M1 X is an a 14 X
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.640]   Basically and Apple hasn't done the X versions every year like they started doing them with like gangbusters
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.440]   But then we got to like the a 10 they didn't do an a 11. They didn't do an a 13 X. They started skipping
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.960]   Generation just do they do an M2 like yeah
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.320]   Standard our eyes
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.080]   Well, they didn't like their product update schedule wasn't as fast the only they made new iPhones every year
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.920]   But they only made new iPad pros every 18 months basically for several years according to mr. German
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.080]   This chip will have up to 32 GPU cores that is a question. I asked this on Sunday because my
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.760]   nephew will
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:30.880]   Graduated from the round school of design this month and I was gonna give him a new MacBook. He needs it for work and
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.040]   Which surprised me I said no, they'll give you one. He said no, they don't I
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.320]   Said wait you get your a new job and they expect you to bring your own laptop. He said yeah
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.240]   So I and his is put I know his potential boss
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.840]   Said oh make sure you get the radion whatever it is 50 800 m the top of the line
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   Intel
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   MacBook Pro and
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.920]   And I said well I
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.720]   Based on what I'm seeing with for instance Adobe which is said
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.600]   Kind of misleadingly our apps are twice as fast in the M1 compared to the I5
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.360]   I
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.960]   Presumed that a next generation Apple chip would have
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.280]   Would it have?
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.040]   800
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.200]   Capable a quality graphics I presume it would I don't think you need I don't think you need next generation
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.840]   I don't think it's a it's a product so even they m1x would have the same cores like each core would be the same the
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.960]   Performance cores would be the same the graphics cores would be the same they would just have more of them
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.520]   Especially more performance cores and more GPU cores maybe because if there's different cooling systems
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.480]   Maybe they could tune the frequencies slightly faster, but they're reticent to touch battery life on a lot of these devices
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.120]   A frequency would have more of them and that's a case with the M1 right now is there all the same frequency, right?
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.840]   Yes, so just cool or don't cool and then they wrap down or don't wrap down
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:54.080]   Very little difference really between all the M1s currently. Yeah, in fact, I was gonna buy I thought give up
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.680]   After this and I was gonna I'm just gonna buy a Mac mini so I can use it on my desktop
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.520]   And then I thought wait a minute
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.360]   Just get a doc because your M1 Mac would pros as good as the Mac mini yes
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.600]   Yeah, and so I did I got anything over 30 minutes. You'll notice no difference
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.080]   Yeah, like at 30 minutes the M the Mac mini will keep going because like it'll keep peak frequency because it's cooling
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.680]   It's just it's not much more voluminous and that much better cooling, right?
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.480]   But after like like are you doing anything that's gonna take peak load for 30 minutes?
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.880]   It is possible. I guess they could put do you know Bloomberg saying them besides 32 GPUs
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.600]   They will have more RAM and they might even put in two
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.800]   chips or dual core in other words
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.320]   So that would be another way that you could beef this up without getting a new generation chip in there
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.200]   It would also be a way you could add more thunderboard thunderbird thunderbolt ports
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.440]   That big flame decal
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.520]   It kind of is a bet didn't they?
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:00.440]   Chips all this is a report from somewhere I don't know
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.720]   I'm I guess german, but
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.320]   Apple ready's Mac book pro. This is back in May though. That's the problem
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:16.400]   And Mac bear revamps so I don't know this may all be it's pretty clear that they must have been
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.640]   Making it although supply chain rumors now say they're gonna start making it in a month or two
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.840]   Yeah
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:30.120]   Maybe because he did a bunch of reports that he's pushed back in time and it's hard to tell up because like when when anybody writes
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.520]   About something they're writing about the echoes of decisions Apple made months ago that yeah
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.320]   And it's hard to tell it's imminent but like you did a watch report yesterday on the same stuff
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.080]   You reported on three months ago, but said it's next year instead of this year
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.480]   Yeah, and this is the same sort of like the the next Mac book air
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.680]   It's gonna be a redesign with them too, but when does that come out the end of this year beginning of next year that stuff's all malleable
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.520]   Apple's current M1 max use an Intel component the USB re timer
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:00.600]   That could be one of the many little chips that are in short supply that could be holding this up to I would do you think it's a chip shortage?
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.600]   That's really the issue
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.640]   Because I know they have all the M1's they know yeah, yeah, yeah trailing edge node stuff
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.320]   That's like not forget five nanometer. That's like ninety nanometer
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:17.000]   Right, that's all the old you know battleship chips that they put into do every other thing that Apple's not doing and those are in in hard supply
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.180]   Yeah, what one of the when the problems there is that that's the the
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.360]   Though the workhorse chips that use the old-fashioned fab technology
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.920]   It's not very those machines aren't very profitable
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.080]   So when chip fabs get an opportunity to make more use of their factory floor space
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.520]   They tend to like shut that stuff out and sell those that machinery off to other makers
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.000]   And so rather instead of this instead of the technology for manufacturing
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.280]   I stuff becoming more accessible and more prevalent it that doesn't necessarily scale
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:51.020]   Year to year to year because again, you're you're not you're making now you're making chips for microwave ovens
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.400]   Not making the chips for for for for back ends of TVs
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.860]   So yeah, they're the chip shortage effects a much much broader pipeline than you think
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:05.240]   So there's there's the with a heavy heart portion of the show
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:11.840]   No new hardware oh man though. Oh, you they were so angry who?
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.920]   That we didn't get them out like there were some people who watched WWC and they felt like they'd been promised new MacBook Pro
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.120]   Yeah, and they also felt that because Apple put an M1 chip in the iPad
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.480]   They were being promised Mac OS on the iPad and Apple broke that promise to them
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.720]   And so there were those two those two harpoons of anger just coursing through a very small percentage of nerd souls all weekend
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.760]   small percentage because
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.880]   Every reasonable person knows in fact German has now started putting it as a disclaimer in a lot of his articles that the timeline may vary
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.480]   You know that you can you can just as you say you can tell people what Apple's working on
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.240]   But there's no way of knowing what apples you're not a treasure biggest
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.120]   Yeah, yeah
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.360]   That this is why at least until the end of the year if there's a piece of technology that you're considering buying and
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.880]   The seller gives you like a really generous return policy like Apple does just pre-order it
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.680]   Just pre-order it to get your first door to get that part of that first shipment in and if you don't like it return it
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.680]   Or if you decide that okay, this isn't really the right time
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.520]   Return it because it's possible that if you need something in November or December
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.000]   You're just not gonna be able to get your hands on it even if it's been out for three four months, okay
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.560]   So we're phenomena with like I don't know just say like nerds in general
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.240]   But there are some people who they are desperately angry that Apple doesn't put out something when they're ready to buy
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   And then the moment they buy it if Apple announces a new version they get even angrier
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.920]   Like they want stuff to only be available and they want to buy it and they don't want Apple to ever put out anything new because that
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:46.840]   invalidates what they bought and like the advice I keep giving is just wait as long as you possibly can before you buy by when you
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:53.760]   Absolutely need to buy get the best thing you can buy and then just enjoy the stuffing out of it because it will always be something next
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:00.200]   So you can't you can't do this mental warfare on yourself. Yeah, I'll also try to do the math on what your how much you're how much
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:06.480]   I benefited from having this M1 M1 MacBook for the past what now seven eight nine months
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.560]   Versus what I would have had to what I would have had to put up with if I had if I had to now wait a year
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.760]   for a MacBook Pro
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:19.840]   I mean I I would have bet money on Apple at least announcing and a new evolutions new evolutions of M1 based MacBooks
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.800]   Excuse me Apple silicon based Macintosh is at WWDC. I was absolutely prepared to be oh gosh
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.560]   I could have had an SD card slot on my MacBook if I had waited until June
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.760]   But that but then you you would have waited and now you're gonna be you would have been waiting another what now three probably
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.960]   That's probably a topic for a later part in the show
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   But at some point at least a couple of months later Apple's gonna announce this thing and they're probably gonna ship it even later than that
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:50.680]   Yeah, that's you know, so good everybody relax is fine. You're gonna get great stuff
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:56.840]   There's three really nice m1s out there right now. They're a good choice
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.640]   Leo knows whenever he buys a new version comes out something that's inevitable
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.280]   and and I guess
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.600]   Fall right at this point
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.060]   Before anything any new hardware. I mean traditionally it's October like traditionally October is the big Mac event
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.520]   September's phone
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:22.120]   October's these year. Yeah, but they did so they did phones in October and Macs in November last year because the world is you know
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   Upside down right now. It's not possible because I was short as little events chip shortages are real
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.240]   They can also do it anytime
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.900]   Yeah, they could decide like it's July and we want to make another episode of the Apple event series
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:38.160]   The only compelling argument for that is people do make laptop purchases or at least plan for laptop purchases
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.340]   for
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.440]   Fall semesters for students right about now. You don't want to wait too long for them
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.880]   And one's probably fine for that like these are the
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.840]   BFE expensive. Yeah, yeah, it's also not using it's also using the old display panel technology
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.080]   So there are fewer problems with getting your hold of everything you need to build that thing. Yeah
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.880]   Actually, I think the Mac book here is pretty much the perfect computer
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.640]   Just buy it. I think you're wrong. Yeah, it's fine for a Mac
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.960]   You're getting a you're getting a lot of stuff for not a whole lot of money
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.480]   and
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:16.840]   You'll you'll gonna have a hard time convincing someone who spent that much a little bit more on an iPad Pro that you know
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   That you're unhappy with this
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:25.880]   Bottom bottom of the list Mac purchase that nonetheless very very beefy processor does everything you want to do
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:31.720]   You attach one Thunderbolt cable to your desktop and suddenly you've got hard drives. You've got you got hard drives
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.200]   You got a screen and they asked they actually all work natively
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.820]   Like the way that you expect a computer to work as opposed to the same thing when you plug the same thing into a
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:45.360]   Into an iPad Pro. I still love mine, but yeah, that's that's a thing. Yeah, I got a fun. I got a
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.240]   Anchor $250 thunderbolt
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.120]   three doc
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.920]   And I just put it next because they have this giant monitor
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.840]   I thought well be kind of nice if I could use that's why I was good to many and yeah, you just docked the Mac book pro
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.120]   It's pretty functionally very almost identical to the mini. I've got I've got this right now
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.800]   The my my M1 Mac book is the most most powerful Mac. I've gotten the house
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   And so right now it's plugged into a 250 dollar cal digit dock again hard drives
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.320]   I'm ripping movies. I'm doing everything that I need to do
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:23.680]   And actually I have to remind myself to undock it so I can exercise the battery once a month or so because it's just my
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.320]   It's just my my my M1 Mac mini right now. I wonder if I over bought complain
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.520]   Do you think I overbought because I spent 250 bucks on this anchor, but it's a
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.080]   thunderbolt three
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   And it has of course a ton of ports. Yeah, it's nice. I mean I
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:48.720]   I feel like this way I could basically make the Mac book be a desktop with this edition of this little thing and
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.880]   Mine started yelling at me the other day like last week I started saying you haven't been taking this back off powers
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.880]   We're only gonna charge it to 60% because obviously not moving it around. That's the new thing
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.200]   I think that's smart. I had to unplug it for a while to get it to yeah, never take me anywhere
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:09.240]   I mean, but like look at the world. I mean like read the room at book pro this thing has a ethernet port
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.560]   Gigabit ethernet port which I which is good. So when I dock I'm now in hardwired. It's got HDMI
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.520]   So it's just it's connected to my monitor
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.400]   I do have to you know do some shenanigans with a monitor to switch it over to a different port
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.880]   But that's all yeah, and I and I have a mouse and keyboard and it's nice
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:35.720]   And it's a perfectly device independent standard. So if your needs change you'll be able to use one other devices the next
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:42.080]   This morning somebody said oh, yeah, we're gonna review a thunderbolt dock for the the iPad pro and I thought oh
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:50.160]   So I connected the new M1 iPad pro to it works too. It doesn't go full screen because it's a four by three
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.520]   So it the aspect ratio is wrong, but it looks pretty nice
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.720]   It works and the keyboard in the mouse appear you had an Apple magic
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.480]   mouse in a
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:07.760]   One of the Matthias keyboards paired up just fine. It's kind of wild. It does but it does give you
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:13.280]   Like a big I did that like my very first day because of course I've got this I got the thunderbolt dock
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.280]   So you gotta try it and
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.920]   A lot of it is like the agony in the SEC because you're like oh my god
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:26.400]   I can't believe this it really is like a desktop and because and the end it actually works nice as a mouse based or a crack
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.160]   Pad based interface. I'm very very happy with it. I could use that way
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.240]   So oh wow yes and look my my my my hard drives again
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.480]   I've got like three different volumes like mounted mounted on the desktop here my Macbook like hey while they're all showing up to the iPad
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.120]   And that's when like the agony part comes like oh, that's right
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.840]   I have to deal with the files app and I copy files, but it's not gonna
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:52.160]   It's not gonna there's no eject there is no eject button like safe eject button in the interface. So I'm just gonna have to like
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:58.440]   I'm gonna have to like go through all this stuff to make sure that this like eight terabyte hard drive is not gonna get smoked
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:05.240]   With its directories or anything like that that it's like you see where all the complaints are coming from where my god
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.400]   This is great great hardware
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.440]   But if you could just put like one more intern on this project of the files app
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.320]   I know you got two interns working on it and you gave them like half the whole summer to work on it
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.440]   I'm sorry. I'm being I'm being I'm sorry. I realize I was being like a jerk
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:19.960]   I'm sorry
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:25.600]   I'm just saying that your the files app has a lot of potential that was we were excited about when it first came out
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   But at this point I should have
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:33.400]   Essentially a version of the finder that's appropriate for the iPad and I don't have anything close to that right now. Yeah
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.320]   Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the Macbook not the iPad the iPad's really an iPad
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.720]   It's a nice it's a nice add it's a nice value add but it doesn't exploit the
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.320]   Potential if it weren't for if it weren't for the way that the iPad handles files
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:52.040]   I think that it would at least be the discussion of well if you've got less than a thousand dollars to spend on an
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.160]   Apple branded desktop
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.000]   Maybe you could even consider getting
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.080]   When the smaller iPad pro with thunderbolt and even dock it to your desktop for a lot for a lot of people
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.440]   This would be a perfectly adequate solution, but without the ability to simply hey
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.400]   I've got something on a flash drive that someone gave me or I'm something a file that I've downloaded from someplace
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.740]   I need to move it from here to here. That's not a really good option
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.120]   It'd be really in it when see one of the things I really interested in is the
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.040]   It used to be called sidecar this is coming in iOS 15 the ability yes
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:31.080]   Yeah, then it kind of might make sense because you can drag a file from your desktop to your iPad
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.960]   Universal control yeah, I really like that. I think that's if it works. That's gonna be unbelievable
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.640]   That's super the the that does presume that you have more than one computer
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:48.920]   Which is which again? I think most the most appropriate use of an iPad is as an accessory as your super mobile right alternative
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:54.360]   Something as you have but that's not what happens. I'd show you've seen the new Apple. Yeah, exactly and here again
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:00.600]   As well now though, so you have both sides. Yeah, but it's it's like it's it's disappointing because
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:06.260]   Those of us who really really are not only like maybe not not just early adopters of the iPad
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.280]   But early believers the people who are like even like at the first demo
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.120]   We were like oh, there's so much you could do with this concept
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:20.680]   This could be this could be like the sports car where if I just take all of this unnecessary weight off of this
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.800]   then this could be so much faster and so much efficient at this job that it's being designed to do and
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.760]   This is this is where it kind of drops the ball. It could really be
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.520]   Apple's version of a $600
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.000]   Windows Windows multi-touch notebook
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.680]   If it had if you if they could just sand over some of these sharp splinters that you get whenever you rub your hands over
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.320]   Oh in a way that Apple did not think that you are going to rub your hand over it
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.760]   I felt really
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.840]   belittled a little bit by apples new ads iPad your next computer is not a computer because honestly I feel just like these people
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.960]   There she is in the desk
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.600]   The printers the cables
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.360]   The wires
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.440]   And she looks out the window and there's somebody doing everything she ever wanted to do
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.080]   And I bet that's me actually right there
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:26.480]   Which is ironic because Apple is the dongle company that they're mocking right guys dongles, but okay
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.400]   See in a way apples cannibalizing their own audience for this aren't they?
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.600]   That's the idea you always said that
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.840]   Yeah, of course of course it's ironic that they're choosing a little mermaid a
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:46.320]   Girl who leapt into like an initially attractive situation without thinking things
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.600]   Royley screwed. Thank you Andy
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.680]   But she should have just bought a laptop like her dad the king's told
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.280]   The king of textual textural analysis mr. Andrew and not go
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:11.600]   My issue is that like even the finder is not good enough and like I'm hoping that this files finally has a little thing
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:17.120]   That spins around to tell me, you know the pro it has a progress circle finally right like every day every day
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.120]   I try to copy a hundred to 200 gigabyte files between my see fast or I see my CF
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.080]   Express card and my Mac and finally just goes you can't disconnect this
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.880]   I'm not disconnecting it nothing in space time has moved and then like the file slows down and then it reconnects and it just I
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.640]   Don't I don't want to see that anymore
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.440]   Like if that's not helpful to me because all you're doing is ruining my transaction
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.600]   I need a new system where you're peacefully in the background using all the great things about Apple file system
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.800]   Buffering it redundantly so that if there's any dislike connections reconnections
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.880]   I don't need to see that you just handle that like packet loss on the internet
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.080]   We have these wonderful technologies now. I demand better. They're both fine in the files that
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.800]   So tired of them just to make you feel better the situations no better in Windows
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:05.600]   It I don't know why it is but these explorer apps that are really kind of fundamental to an operating system that let you see
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.200]   What's on your hard drive?
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:14.440]   They're terrible. They're so inconsiderate and by the way on Linux - I'm thinking about the gnomes a nautilus
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.600]   Finder is just as bad
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.280]   So maybe there's something about these kinds of utilities that it just they're not well done
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:29.880]   I know what it is. That's the job you give to Joe. It's like who wants to code the explorer
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:35.240]   I'll let Joe do it. He just got out of college. He'll have fun with it
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.600]   It's not the it's not the job that the top of the line programmers want maybe you know
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.080]   That's my you don't you don't you don't hire someone who?
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   Who was topping their classes Stanford and hire them away from from another prestigious career by saying we're gonna put you in charge of
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.320]   Making it makes sense how you move files from one device to another
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:05.880]   My PhD work was about this new type of I drop that gives you AR just through this liquid coating over the splitter of your eye
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:11.380]   Manage and trying to drive a Ireland manager can write stupid
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:17.920]   That's a great idea, but we really need to check button on the files and the iPad
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:25.480]   As a 20% project. Yeah, we will we will see some interesting changes however in iOS 15
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.560]   I'm very excited about I'm certain the big things were happening in the next year and iPad OS
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.280]   But this this would have been a great year for them to like make the great things happen or at least show off thing
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:41.520]   Great things they hope to happen in 2022 on iOS 15 is good though like there are some there are some good things on the iPad this year
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.480]   But they're not there yet. Oh, you mean like even with iOS 14 iPad OS 14
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.920]   No iPad OS 15 likes yes, just the way they are everything's gonna get better. Yes
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.280]   multitasking was like our can't like arcane spellcraft
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:01.400]   I never use you have to figure out just the exact time to not pull an app off the dock or to delete it by accident
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.320]   Or to launch it but to pull it into the window you wanted
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.780]   And God help you if you wanted to put it into slide over immediately or change a setup you already had and they fixed so much of that
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:18.120]   Absolutely, I can't isn't it. I'm right almost I'm so close to doing the public beta on iPad OS 15 doing the beta
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.840]   It's good. I'll wait till you see it's okay
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:26.320]   Isn't it bizarre that all that all that was for me at least 20% of that is just by oh wow
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:32.000]   You actually gave me keyboard shortcuts for managing multitasking operations. Yes like wow
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   1988 rocks
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.720]   And more than that like for everything like they gave keyboard like this it's fully bounced almost everything now
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:45.560]   It's like they did the promise of that two years ago saying every every feature should be accessible to everybody no matter what the input method is
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.720]   trackpad keyboard voice
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.640]   You know touch all of those should be co-equal, but it's taking a while. Yeah
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:59.240]   Public beta is app for iOS 14 7 watch OS 6 7 6 Mac OS 11 5
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.160]   But not for moderate
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:08.440]   There is a when is the public beta for moderate and I pass July July it'll be July
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.640]   It's usually like a month after they get they get the first developer seeds
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.600]   The first developer seed comes out at the dub dub at that day and then there's usually one
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:21.160]   One or two like hot fixes, you know the ones that come in ones that come in red and not blue
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:27.480]   I'm gonna violate they've weighed the public. I'm gonna violate my own rules and probably do that because I have that top of the line
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.120]   M1 iPad and I really want to use it to its fullest extent
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.000]   So maybe I'll put that a few rings, but it hasn't been catastrophic
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.720]   Okay, so it's good to know it's because it'll be even more stable for the public beta. I'm sure
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.520]   If you plug it, this is from scooter X an ntfs formatted ntfs
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.960]   That's windows file system formatted stick into the iPad. You can now be rid of it the files app
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.880]   No, it's read only no, right, but that's kind of like the iMac
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.800]   He also points out and you'll be happy to know there is a progress bar on
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.280]   The files app on a high OS
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:10.720]   15 progress circle on top of the document icon. Yeah, so some steps are being made in the red direction
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.920]   I agreed the multitasking is gonna be very interesting. I you know, I
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.120]   have some weird fetish for note-taking apps and
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.800]   Yes, and I'm really interested by this corner slide up with the notes
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.720]   I
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.680]   Quick notes quick notes and the fact that it goes and I really feel like I might that's something
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:33.280]   I might actually use all the and it persists if you go back to a web page your quick note for that web page
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.000]   I love that that looked super powerful
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.080]   Super good. The other thing that makes it all work so good is the live text is so so well done
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.880]   Like it's it's instant
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.760]   It's it's always actually live because they can use those neural engine processors on the devices that have them
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:54.120]   So it'll go back in time and go through your existing photo library the way it did with face recognition
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:00.800]   For example, but it'll also if you go to a web page with a photo on it'll make that photo instantly available in live text as well
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.640]   And they trained it with these models that had just all these different types of typeface and handwriting
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.440]   And then they went through and distorted it and trained it again
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.960]   Scooted it just trained it again elongated it wrapped it around circles that all these things and kept training it
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.320]   So like you have blurry little text things and you can not only caught, you know
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.280]   Select them copy them if they're data detectors
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:29.520]   You can click the email address or the phone number all of these things it just it unlocks all the informational content in every photo
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.920]   You've ever taken so somebody told me that the WWDC for live text
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.720]   They showed the Simpsons it reading the Simpsons blackboard. Is that did you see that?
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.320]   Yeah, it's so good. Is that was that a keynote? Oh?
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.640]   Was that I was today they do it session that was a session though. Yeah, that's really really cool
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.000]   Yeah, and this is I just have a screen class. I'm sorry go ahead to me
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.720]   This is just as significant as one Apple decided to challenge Google with maps
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:03.520]   Because you know that it's whatever they do very first of all is gonna be rudimentary and maybe functional but not exciting
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.080]   But you need to get that equity in before you can get to that
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:14.680]   The golden era where now when you're being able to translate die when you're able to translate language and reckoning language
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.920]   You've got so many international languages not just international international languages
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.720]   But individual regional dialects that you're actually doing that's not the sort of thing that you can do
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.040]   When you first get out of the gate, but you have to get the fundamentals down first and once Apple gets that
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.400]   functionality that used to be the essential domain of Google
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.720]   That's something that I think that's a big chunk that apples had missing from its portfolio the ability to
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.040]   go into like Google photos and just
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:46.760]   Give it a random word and whatever word you give it if if it's text on a sign in a fixture if it's contextual and an
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:52.760]   Object or an image it will be able to find it and and service it for you apple has not been able to show that kind of
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.280]   That kind of agility and AI yet like a functional practical AI yet
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.600]   And I'm glad to see that Apple's starting to get out of the gate with that despite the fact
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.080]   They've got this great hardware with neural engines that are powering so many features that don't have this big
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:11.200]   Automated artificial intelligence machine learning sticker in front of it all the features that are M1 that work on the M1
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.760]   But not on the on Intel processors that you think of geez how come I can't do this on on Intel's because well
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.320]   Well because it's not using the it's not using the main CPU
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.760]   It's using all these neural engines to get this work done
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.520]   So this is I'm glad that Apple's finding that is putting that club in its bag
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.320]   Renee you said you're doing screenshots of the sessions. Yeah, I'm getting confused
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.400]   It's like I'm in my photos app and I've taken so many screenshots over the years
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.400]   And I just open the screenshot and I start selecting text and I forget that even a photo
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   I think I'm on the right side
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:45.600]   Especially because you're probably like me where it's like especially during a keynote
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:53.240]   It's like you're taking screenshots of slides to get things and then I'm just I've had exactly the same experience where I'm just like randomly three months later
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.480]   Saying oh god
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:00.440]   I need to it was I need I need to know what the clock speed of this thing is and I was expecting to find like its surface a note
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.640]   That I just wrote to myself while I was doing research like no
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:09.520]   Here is the actual actual screenshot of the actual slide when they were giving all this stuff and that ate that that blip
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:15.440]   Vert that they gave you in the keynote. That's the sort of stuff that turns you from a turns machine from a practical tool
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.480]   To what feels like an assistant that's looking out for you and trying to get ahead of your work for you
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.680]   Yeah, wow
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.100]   I can't make typos anymore because I we'd have to re-type all that stuff that was like in a locked away slide
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.880]   I would always like transpose letters or get numbers mixed up and now I just copy and paste it and I
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:39.360]   I can't blame that stinks so how does it do with like handwriting and I mean obviously the text has to be pretty well formed for this, right?
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.640]   Well because they use the same it's based on the same system. They used for scribble
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.200]   You know all right philosophically based on the same system is for scribble
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:52.280]   So an apples very you know proud of the fact that they don't ever harvest user data for this
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:35:00.080]   They just go out solid for my or or a self source tons of samples and then run them through machine learning and then do a bunch of different
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.960]   deformations like stretching
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:08.760]   Compressing skewing wrapping all these things and then retrain so they said that they can get more they can get so many models out of just
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.800]   Like even a commercial sampling set that they've made it really robust so you've been able to do do it with pretty much anything
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.280]   I love it that it takes your old photos and does that
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.800]   Yeah, that's fast
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:28.600]   I wish it would be great if I'm not faulting Apple for not necessarily publicizing what data sets they're using to train these things
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:33.880]   I've that's something that stuck out to me as well Renee that they're the fact they can do something this well
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.640]   By simply buying date or scuba buying or leasing data sets as opposed to collecting information
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.880]   Which is actually which again is a privacy sort of this is a moment
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:49.440]   But it leads to a real world sampling of what your users are doing with with handwriting or with speech or the photos
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.160]   Tim de Guevara who of course was fired from Google
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.280]   because of
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.680]   Shady for shady reasons on Google's part
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.980]   Related to a paper that was then published. I think I think the paper was called stowd dangers of so
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.520]   Stoshiac so stochastic parents stochastic parents
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.120]   Thank you very much
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:13.880]   And this is one of the problems that she was that this paper which she wrote with three other researchers was pointing out that
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.960]   Unfortunately, the publicly available data sets
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.600]   They are very very like mail-based culturally isolated. They're not
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.880]   They don't reflect just about it. They don't reflect the entire community world community
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:31.080]   They just affect the community of people who contributed to that data set which tend to be very very monotheastic
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:35.840]   And so that's gonna be a problem that Apple will have to deal with as they're doing this
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:43.000]   But as you say into it Apple will I mean exactly as we've seen so many other spots this was to fire the researchers
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.280]   Do better
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.480]   Yeah, I hope anyway, here's the clip from
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.240]   iOS today with rosemary orchard
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:37:00.600]   Demonstrating live text on my iPad and somebody posted this tweet and so for people who are watching at home
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.400]   Then they might not be able to tell
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:09.440]   This is a picture of Bart Simpson the opening credits from the she's selecting my has to write lines in text
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.080]   It's something funny from this case is I must not install bases on my main device
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.320]   This is a very good piece of the lines of the text unless you're near my
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.760]   She's actually able to select that now. It's a fairly regular my main device. I will copy that
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   So it's back to dress
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.880]   Remove that word there. Look at that. You copy text. I have to look at that copy that out
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:35.920]   It's so amazing Rosemary. That was really a great demo. So I'm excited
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.120]   I mean I have to by the way and somebody the chat was pointing this out. Thank you web 1802 or 7802
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:46.000]   That unlike Google and yeah Google lens does this Microsoft has office lens
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.680]   It does this but unlike Google Apple's exposing an API that will let any app on iOS do it
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.080]   And that's a big deal and that's a big difference
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:00.080]   And it forces them to do it privately as well like that way when Apple's been very clever about that this WDC
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:07.560]   They've made almost everything that they do including parental controls including all the lens stuff including all of the frameworks for their private relay stuff
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:13.440]   Including their new notification suppression system their focus thing and they're like you get permission for this
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:19.000]   But you have to follow these privacy regulations and if the user thinks that you're abusing it they get to turn you off
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:24.720]   You know which is what the what Apple could not do if people were rolling their own version these are using some
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.120]   Sketchy SDK from a third party. Yeah, yeah
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.840]   So okay, maybe I will I guess I'll do the public beta
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.360]   I'm not gonna do it on my iPhone
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.200]   But but I will I think I will do it on the on the on the I'm running it on my iPhone
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.720]   But I'm a well-known fool. Yeah your main phone like your your actual phone the phone you use every year
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.120]   You sometimes like sometimes I'm stuck with no signal and nothing but the time is great
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.200]   Well keep us up to date on how it's working because by July
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.400]   I don't I would I would definitely say I mean I guess if you have a developer account which you need to do this
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.520]   You know you're smart enough to know whether this is a good idea
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.680]   So what I do is I look at engineers that I know and if I see them doing any form of a head shake twitch
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   I do not put on the bed
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.960]   Yeah, if they're smiling then I go ahead like 2019 I did not
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.600]   2020 there have been years where it has been a bad idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.360]   Ever since they've split ever since they've split it apart from
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.440]   General beta released to know this is a developer beta
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:28.960]   But this is a public beta. They've actually in the past few years at least in the past few years
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.640]   They have not been many scariest actually I don't think they've written any scary show stoppers
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.600]   We I mean the the the the the lady with the lamp in the middle of the harbor in this entire thing is
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.520]   Oh, remember that beta of Mac OS that actually destroyed all your the data in your hard drive
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.520]   But that was like ten years ago
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:50.840]   And that's the it's enough to make sure that you understand the rights and responsibilities of running beta software
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:56.960]   But I would say that if there's a specific feature that really think would it would turbo charge your workflow
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:03.320]   It's worth at least trying do we do one hell of a backup first and make sure you have a pull you're not doing it on the
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.240]   on a day that
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:11.560]   That you're kind of hosed if things go south on you, but I would not necessarily dissuade people from
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:16.280]   Installing a public beta again with certain with certain caveats installed
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:24.760]   Co Captain Jack in our discord or a club twit discord says that bat his battery life is suffering on the iPhone and the watch on the beta
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.320]   That it's noticeably different and that's not unusual. So you should be aware of that if you're gonna do it
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.840]   Because they're running a bunch of stuff in the background running a bunch of but collect
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:40.360]   Optimize for performance. It's all optimized for like developer beta right do not explode right right but yeah, you know
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:46.440]   So again my suggestion unless you're a developer in which case you know what you're doing to wait until next month
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:52.280]   And we'll get a report from Renee when he when the public beta comes out and we'll just watch him twitch or not
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.920]   And then that's what dowrymple does he takes me going to put it on does it work?
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.920]   And I'm like yeah
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.720]   Renee is definitely the first penguin. We all shove off the ice flow
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:09.400]   Bubbles of blood that okay, then we'll go in boy
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.280]   WWJD what would Jim dowrymple do JDD?
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:20.760]   Tell me look look to look to Renee here. Can't say no. It's Jim. See if he's floating
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.980]   We will we will tell your story Renee
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.980]   Thank you
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:35.060]   Hey, let's take a little break more to come lots more to talk about Renee Richie
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:40.140]   Andy and I go Alex taking the day off. He had some important business to do, but he'll be back next week
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.860]   Our show today brought to you by audible
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.940]   I love audible Andy. I know you love audible - oh yes
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.780]   Missed being able to talk about our audible pics of the week
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.700]   I am now knee deep in the wheel of time series
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:42:00.140]   All of them extremely lengthy. I finished the first one a mere 26 hours
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.620]   I think some of them are even longer, but I love for me what I love with audible. I love
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.420]   immersing myself in an audiobook
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:14.700]   Because an audible does a great job on the wheel of time they have multiple narrators and they it's just really well done and I just really
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:20.380]   I'm really loving it and I'm in that world, you know, and that's one of the things an audiobook I think could do for you
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.180]   Uh is immerse you in that experience while you're at the beach
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:30.460]   You better believe we're going to Hawaii next month. I'm taking audible and it's not just audiobooks
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:36.780]   Oh man audible plus has all kinds of content now if you're looking for a summer partner

[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.180]   When i'm barbecuing especially those long smokes
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:22.780]   When i have it when i'm when i'm when i'm doing a brisket you better believe audible comes along
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.620]   What are you listening to these days? Andy
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:30.460]   I'll tell you what i just downloaded yesterday invisible women data bias in a world designed for men
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.940]   uh just showing how
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:39.340]   pervasive these problems are about how there is this uh like a town meeting town board of supervisors meeting
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.940]   in the
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:46.060]   Uh in northern europe at which they're talking about exactly this issue and one of the commissioners was like joker
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.420]   nurazi josh at least at least our snow plows don't show any gender bias
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:54.300]   And then they said huh actually we haven't looked at that and they looked at that and they discovered that well
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.540]   There actually is because
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:03.660]   We send our snow plows out to plow highways and like main thoroughfares to like businesses first when disproportionately
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:08.540]   Women like are you taking public transportation or walking or their own personal transportation?
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:13.740]   We should like shift some of we should shift some of the priority to local streets and sidewalks and after they did that
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.380]   They found out that they were actually saving a lot of money
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:21.820]   By like people in the in the local economy and this is the sort of stuff that never
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.900]   For for most people including people who look and sound like me
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:30.700]   It doesn't occur to you even if you feel as though you're you're pretty aware person
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.740]   And it needs you need these case studies and someone who is this
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:34.780]   uh
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:41.580]   Who can communicate about them in such a broad way to really really open your eyes wider than they've been opened before
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:48.380]   It's always dangerous when I go to the audible sites and then I ran across this bitter blood casem versus casem
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:52.860]   Uh a podcast about the bitter battle over kasey casams
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:46:00.940]   Inheritance uh he left about a hundred million dollars when the great american dj passed and his family fought bitterly over it
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:05.660]   I you know what gonna have to add that the nice thing is that's included with my audible plus subscription
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:10.220]   So it's an easy thing to add audible's just great. I just finished the eye of the world
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.820]   29 hours at 57 minutes. So let's call it 30 hours
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:17.580]   Oh good. The one i'm in the middle of now the great hunt is only 26 hours
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:21.500]   Then the next one's 24 hours the next one's 41 hours
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:26.780]   It's like he was getting paid by the but the word but I tell you what it's great listening
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.580]   Audio books. I just love them. I've been an audible member since 2000
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.900]   That's a lot it's 21 years of audible and I have never
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.580]   Regretted one minute of it for limited time amazon prime members
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:43.420]   You could save 53 on four months of audible just 695 a month
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.620]   If you're not an amazon prime member go to audible and sign up
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:52.220]   So for amazon prime so you can hit this deal and much more get out of summer with audible prime days coming up
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.500]   Isn't it next week?

[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:42.060]   And supporting our podcast. Thank you for supporting the podcast by going to audible.com
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.980]   Mac break that makes a big difference. It really does
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.980]   Uh
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:53.340]   Okay, I I wanted to ask rene about this one. I don't know if you have a thought on it or not the secret
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:57.020]   M one apple co-processor. It's kind of a link baity
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:01.260]   title, but a developer named dougal johnson has
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.900]   Discovered that there is a
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:07.980]   Matrix co-processor the amx apple matrix co-processor
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.860]   Inside the m one that is not neither documented
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.420]   Nor revealed and the basic explanation of this is that arm
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:21.740]   Which apple has an arm architecture license arm allows companies to add additional
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:26.380]   Microcode but not to make it public because they don't want to fragment
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:28.460]   the arm
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.220]   You know ecosystem. So a company like apple
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:36.940]   Can say look what we really need is more instructions like matrix processing instructions
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.060]   Which are used for artificial intelligence and gaming and all sorts of stuff
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.460]   We want to add some instructions
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:47.020]   We keep them private in a private library developers have access to it through the library
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:52.780]   But it doesn't fragment the ecosystem and that's I think correct me if i'm wrong
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.220]   What this amx is doing
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.940]   Is that right rene i get that right i beg the premise
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.420]   Yeah, but i beg the premise of the article
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:07.340]   Uh or the the discovery because apple's been really upfront about the amx they've had it up on stage numerous
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.900]   We'll never mind they've just linked it. Yeah, no, it got me. I really didn't get yeah
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:18.140]   Um, but the reason like the thing is that and it it highlights another part of the part of the problem is that
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:24.700]   For some reason apple people some people don't want to give apple any credit for like the m1 or the a14 or any of these
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:30.940]   Oh, it's just a arm. We just took all the arm chip. Yeah, yeah, but like when they talk about amd they never say oh the x86
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:35.820]   They just they say amd when they say intel like i just say apple like because that's the parody here
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:40.620]   No one's looking at a ps5 and saying oh, it's such great x86 inside that thing
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.780]   It's no it's a really good arm. Um amd
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.420]   CPU for
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:53.340]   Soc and and one of the reasons is apple switched from their design license after the a5 and god an architecture license
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.140]   And they have as far as i know one of the most permissible
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:50:00.700]   Architecture licenses available and they can do all sorts of custom things with it
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.980]   And the whole reason arm is doing v9 now the upcoming arm v9
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:09.820]   Instruction said architecture is to backport a lot of the things apple did because they were such a high volume
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.980]   Premiums like they just had to solve a lot of problems that arm hadn't had to solve yet
[00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:18.860]   They are bringing all of those things or many of those things like the security the neural technology all of those
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.700]   To everybody at arm not in exactly the same way, but they thought good idea
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.940]   It's let's propagate them, but a lot of that stuff
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:31.340]   It's it's an arm instruction set that apple is using is a very small part of the cpu that they're still using
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.060]   And i find all this the banter around it fascinating
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:37.900]   Is it the case then that there are there are probably many more
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.700]   Extensions like this to the architecture that just you know apple
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:46.140]   For completely appropriate reasons keeps to itself
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:48.860]   Is that makes sense that this is just one of many
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:53.100]   Yeah, like i'm sure the i like they keep their silicon ip really
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:58.860]   People go and shoot the dies, you know for a reason right um, but the case of the of the amx apple matrix
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:06.780]   Multipliers they decided that just an apple neural engine wasn't enough that there were some cases where the cpu was better tasked or the gpu
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:14.700]   Better tasked so they created a machine learning controller the same way they had a performance controller to decide which tasks needed big cores versus small cores
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:20.460]   They have a machine learning controller that decides this this particular ai task is better suited for
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:27.100]   The compute cores in the cpu or the compute cores in the gpu or the the dedicated cores in the ane
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.180]   And then it moves things around it round trips them and because of unified memory
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:35.020]   It's an incredibly efficient process and that gives them a lot of advantages, but
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.740]   It's like this has been on slides for two three years already. It's good link bait and i fell for it
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:44.940]   I mean i have to say for years i bought the windows secrets books for the same reason secret apis
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:50.140]   Have always been a fascination of developers apple and microsoft both have done this for years
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:57.500]   And you know sometimes they're accused of keeping them to themselves like we have a secret api so that our programs will work better
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.340]   Than your programs i don't think that's the ever been the case with apple
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:07.100]   They they expose those in the libraries and you don't have to know about amx
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:12.940]   It just happens automatically just like all microcode happens abstracted right? Yeah, unless you're right in assembly language
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:18.300]   It's always abstracted. Yeah, so i don't let apple move things around under the covers like we just see the interface
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:23.100]   But they can keep changing the pipes they can put in better pipes and your stuff still works because you're not targeting a pipe
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:25.980]   Targeting the junction in front of it. Well, and in fact
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:30.540]   For years there have been hidden or deprecated
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.260]   api calls even
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:38.140]   Uh and apple will say don't use these and for years developers have used them anyway
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:43.980]   And then their software breaks when the new operating system comes out a new hardware comes out and they get all up in arms
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.380]   But you shouldn't have used them
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:52.220]   The apple watch moved from 32 bit to 64 bit with zero developer stress at all it was managed because of bitco
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.620]   Not remarkable in today's park the texture world
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:58.700]   Sorry just just quickly to be fair the reason why people developers
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:03.020]   Keep using these old api's is because they work. Yeah, and they're faster often
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:09.260]   Yeah, they work and oftentimes when apple gives them something they want to replace it with that thing doesn't work or it's not appropriate for
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:10.860]   for their task
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:17.740]   Uh and just just getting back a moment to talk about apple has the special co-processor that they they haven't documented
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.700]   Uh, that's that's that's that's bunkum, of course
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:26.780]   But of course the they also do they also hold certain entitlements for for app permissions to themselves
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:31.100]   So that they can their apps can do things that they don't let other third party apps do or
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:35.420]   They will only let us very very small handful of blue chip apps
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:42.140]   Do this do this function this one way or give them an exception to an app store rule for for api use that they
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.860]   Won't let the general public use in the developer community
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:51.740]   So that's oftentimes one of the reasons why the reasons why if there is like a metal cabinet anywhere near a developer's desk and has a
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:55.900]   Forehead shape dent in it. That's one of the reasons why that dent is there
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.140]   uh
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:07.180]   So I I have to say I think uh apple is has kind of has his house in order with regard to this
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:13.420]   And uh the gee rambo's finding this stuff anyway like within three minutes when you beta coming out anything that they didn't tell us is
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.500]   Is posted on the internet anyway? Yeah
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.140]   There is the issue though
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:22.780]   In fact, I just read a really good article on let me see if I can pull it up
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:32.060]   Um of of documentation the uh, this is from the eclectic light company blog the elephant at ww dc
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.660]   um
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:41.020]   He he reminds us that in the early years of the mac it had the best documentation ever it had a full series of books
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.580]   In fact, I have a home the inside macintosh
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:49.180]   uh published by atus and wesley written by people like scott kennaster and really good technical authors
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.660]   working with apples engineers they
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:58.300]   They were so elegant and so beautiful and it was so much fun to code on a mac because it was so well documented
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.860]   apples kind of fallen away from this a little bit
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:08.300]   He points out that the documentation for the apple file system a pf s is zero to terrible
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:16.620]   And uh, and you know basically unusable, but apple is attempting and on the other hand, there's the platform security guide which is very well written
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:20.700]   And the new inclusivity guidelines from the interface are amazing
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:24.700]   So but he said one of the things uh that he did note
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:32.220]   This year is that apple is recognizing the problem and is starting to do a better job of documenting
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:40.380]   Um, they were incredibly undermanned for especially when apple split out into the multiple operating systems before like they really had to document ios and macos
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:45.980]   That was about it and then they went through this rapid expansion of adding watch os and tv os is a distinct thing
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:50.140]   um, and now they have you know things that are basically audio os and
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:57.260]   There's there's so much and that their teams were so traditionally so small apple had bankruptcy mentality for so long and also
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:02.620]   You know individual incubator startups within the company mentality that they just did not have enough bodies to throw at this stuff
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:08.700]   And I think they recognized that two years ago. It was so painful so painful with lack of documentation that
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.980]   They're trying to be more aggressive in in building that up
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.780]   But I think just based on apples culturally they run things
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:20.460]   They don't disclose people like really early like there's a whole bunch of things that get in the way of this stuff and they're gonna have to really figure out
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:26.940]   It's hard. Well, it's historically very hard. The last thing a programmer wants to do is his right documentation
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.340]   um, he he says um
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.700]   That this new uh, d o c c
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:38.620]   framework this developer documentation framework. I guess it's doc c is probably how I should
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:43.340]   Read it, which is a documentation compiler that started in x code 13
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:46.460]   Allows you to do something called literate programming
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.220]   I've been a fan of literate programming since donald can you throw it about it?
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:56.060]   I was a scientific american. He would wrote a published an article idea being instead of writing code
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:01.820]   You basically are writing the documentation with bits of code in the documentation and use a tool
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:04.620]   That will then compile the documentation
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:12.220]   And in effect you've you've written the documentation while you're writing the code and that's what doc c does it converts mark downbase text
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:18.620]   Into rich documentation for the swift frameworks and the packages as they're writing it
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:21.580]   And so there's a lot of promise here
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:23.900]   um, he points out
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:30.700]   Uh, deo c doc c. Yeah, we said deo c c. He doc c looks exciting and demonstrates that apple recognizes its problem
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.900]   But then he points out of a few traps
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.380]   um, but this is um
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.540]   This is going to be very
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:44.300]   Interesting to see if if he follows if apple follows through on this because this is probably the right way
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:49.580]   To write code. You just have to convince developers. They need to start writing literate code
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:52.060]   Um
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.060]   And you know what it's good for everybody
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.500]   He writes doc c is really an a plaintiff cry for help
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.660]   Teams are still trying to fill the yawning chasm ironically one of the best new man pages
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.180]   I've read in a long time
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:07.100]   Is that for bpu till a command tool which apple repeatedly warns?
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.660]   Shouldn't be used except experimentally
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.460]   But but those are exceptions for every instance like that
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:17.900]   There are tens of man pages which haven't been updated for years and now don't match their usage information
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:23.340]   Um two failings still trouble apple and its amazing products bugs and documentation
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:28.620]   Without scoring up to both and changing course they can only get worse. I think apple has a path forward
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.620]   I think that's the point of doc c
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.060]   Yeah
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.060]   I hope that it continues
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:39.900]   It's too bad. This is kind of a recurring problem that cuts across a lot of different products everybody's problem
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:46.460]   Yeah, well, not not just the specific problem we've been talking about where but where apple who has a mence
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:50.940]   Resources who if they want to create a car division they can hire up and create a car division
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.700]   But you often hear about
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:58.860]   Well, the reason why this feature is late for was if it was late for mac OS because they had a pull all kinds of all kinds of mac OS team members
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.260]   Off to get ipad OS or to get ios running
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:09.260]   It's it's it's I do I do agree that I think that there's a shortage of of bodies working on documentation and other simple things
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:15.740]   And I think that one of the when the few logistical problems that apple has traditionally had is they don't know how to put
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:22.220]   Bodies into into the right seats how to add seats to the right offices to make sure everything runs smoothly
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:28.620]   They had not one not two not three but four sessions at ww dc about using doc c so
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:34.940]   I'm very hopeful. This is kind of what it will look like which is you're you're writing in your comments
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.660]   Uh, you're writing
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:44.700]   It's it's more than just good comments ultimately what what I think the goal of literate programming is to write prose that turns into code
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:49.900]   But uh, but good commenting would be a start and then the compiler will automatically extract that
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:55.740]   That's widely done in other platforms widely done and unix as well an open source
[00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:03.740]   So doc c let's do it guys. Let's get on it. I'd love to touch talk to rich seagull. We got to get rich on again
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:07.740]   Um, I'd love to talk to him. He's in paris
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:11.420]   No, no, no and he's parrots. Okay. Yeah
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:15.980]   Someone I I I'm I'm just messaging him now just to
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:20.940]   Time network. We're saying we're saying nice things about him. I'd love to know you know what he thinks about all of this
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:26.060]   Because he's this is this is the he's inside. You know inside. Yeah, I'm sure he has the whole inside mac bookshelf
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:32.860]   He's the original. Yeah rich rich seagull. There's there's a justice league of uh, apple programmers out there
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:38.220]   Uh men women every kind that have been doing this for 20 years that know it inside and out
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:43.180]   They know the culture inside and out they have the requisite dense in the file cabinets in their offices
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:49.420]   Uh, and they are the people that when apple that really when they start when they when they make a blog post about a problem
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:56.220]   They're having it can set the world on fire because they don't they they know what they everyone knows that they know what they're talking about
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:00.460]   And they don't just fly off like half teakettled on things like that
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:05.820]   So yeah, he's rich is definitely in that justice league and for those who don't know bb edit is his barebone software
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:11.100]   Yes, it is his baby the classic the classic the greatest text editor of all time
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.620]   Uh billboard magazine interviews eddy q
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:18.300]   about spatial audio
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:21.260]   and uh in in which at one point
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.180]   Eddy says nobody's gonna nobody's gonna know the difference
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:33.420]   He says the reality of lossless. Well, I'm sorry not spatial lossless. Thank you for correcting me. Yes
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:38.220]   Uh, loss is high bit radio. He says the reality of lossless is if you take a hundred people
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.700]   And you take a stereo song and lossless
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:46.860]   And you take a song that's been an apple music that's compressed. I don't know if it's 99 or 98 that can't tell the difference
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.340]   But I think that's probably true most people
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:53.340]   Cannot tell the difference. There's some people who can actually over air pods. Yeah
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.940]   Now we're supporting lossless. We think there's a set of customers
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:01.820]   It's a small set of customers, but they want it will certainly give it to them and they all have it as part of this
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:06.220]   The good news is they'll have lossless and they'll have delbi atmos and spatial
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:13.100]   And I think uh apple's right to kind of focus on spatial as opposed to uh lossless. So I took the time
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.780]   Last week of playing apple spatial music on every platform I have
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:26.460]   In effect, I spent some money because I went out and got the $550 apple air pods max because I thought well
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:31.340]   I should really hear what apples kind of that's the reference for it right the reference platform is this
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.820]   Airpods max their spatial audio. Yeah
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:37.980]   Uh, unfortunately, I don't consider a pods max a high fidelity
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:43.180]   Uh reproduction system and they're not very good, but that's probably because they're bluetooth
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:49.100]   And yes, you know bluetooth is is limited. It's highly compressed music and it really sounds that way
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:54.460]   It's a little muddy from my ears. They were designed to make the best bluetooth possible, but you're still limited by bluetooth
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:59.020]   Yeah, um, so I also played it back using a high quality deck
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:05.820]   on uh a $300 pair of sennheiser uh in years, which are very very good the ie 300s and on my
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.380]   $1,000 electrostatic high-fi men
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:16.620]   uh ht 560s and on a variety of speaker systems in my car which has a premium audio system from b&o and of course on my
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:23.340]   uh, my good system using my elak speakers and I I guess I would what I would say is
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:28.300]   And I think this is apples kind of apples point was certainly pointed zane low in the introduction
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.180]   And by the way the marvin gay thing is a really good way to introduce it
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.620]   That
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:38.460]   Spatial is to stereo what stereo was to mono or close to maybe not quite as much
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.580]   But it's a it's a step forward. It's much more open
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:45.820]   Um, uh, you you sound you don't sound like you're listening to headphones
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:49.740]   You sound like listening in a room and by the way, I can even hear it on stereo speakers
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:54.620]   Although one thing I know and I don't know my name maybe they gave you some information on this
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.900]   I do have a dole bee system not an ammo system a dole bee system
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:03.500]   Which will play surround sound with the apple tv on things like roger waters us and them
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.220]   But when I play apple music
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.700]   Spatial audio through the apple tv
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:14.140]   They report stereo. I think spatial is for stereo despite the dole bee atmos
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:20.380]   They'll try to do it. So if they're on both sides, so if they have an atmos signal
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:24.860]   They'll just use that for spatial mapping if they don't they'll try to do that computational audio
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:29.740]   It's not sending an atmos signal to my stereo which would see it. No
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:34.140]   It's not on apple tv on apple tv. You need a dole bee atmos
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.900]   Capable, I believe no, I do I I have a dole
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:45.260]   Updated apple tv connected to a dole bee. It's not atmos. It's dole bee, but I should do the atmos because it has to be atmos
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.380]   Like it's only your soul, but I don't believe
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:53.100]   I don't believe it's any receiver because if I listen to a dole bee
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:57.740]   Watch a dole bee movie. I get the surround five ones around seven ones around
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:03.900]   Yeah, but uh, but you're saying that spatial will not unless your decoder does atmos
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:08.220]   Okay, I believe I'm gonna double check that I believe that
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:11.900]   I mean it's it's it's and also some of the dole bee atmos songs are just not good
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.060]   And I think they've they've admitted it as much like some of the artists have been incredibly engaged
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:19.020]   Ingoing that in the original tracks and choosing
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:22.700]   What they want and others are just uh here you go and it's like no you made all the wrong
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:26.460]   Why did you even do this? Yeah, I mean that's what happened. Remember when CDs came out
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.300]   Uh, yes
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:31.500]   There were some really bad CD masters because they just said well
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.500]   I'll take these tapes and put them on a CD kid
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.940]   And pay them 10 bucks an hour and we'll get them all done
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.860]   um
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.860]   Although eddy points out that the labels
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.900]   Have have a lot of interest
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:49.900]   Um, and it's true that they launched with hundreds and hundreds of songs in every genre. I was surprised
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.980]   I didn't expect so many songs
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:56.540]   And they want to get on those playlists. Yeah. Yeah, everybody wants to be on the playlist right?
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:02.220]   I think they sound good. I think when it's done properly. It's a little better than stereo. Let's put it that way
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.940]   How's that?
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.340]   Would you agree Renee? What's your experience?
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:12.860]   If I could for me, it's like if this song is a song that I would love to be in a concert hall to hear
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:16.860]   Um, you know, like I'm not Andy like I'm not I'm not into opera
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.580]   But I'm into like big john Williams and Howard shore
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:23.100]   Uh and alan solvestry, you know theatrical compositions
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:27.820]   And if I can listen to that as though i'm in the middle of the theater where they're playing with a full orchestra
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:30.060]   And the sound is literally all around me
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:35.100]   I really really really enjoy that other songs. It doesn't make a real difference to me like yes
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.460]   I can appreciate
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:40.300]   And if you haven't heard it, there is a sprenity called will she got to do a musical play at apple
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.060]   Which is just the peak of sprenity called wellness. I think of all time
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.980]   Uh, where they're demonstrating the spatial audio api and the features
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:52.620]   And you hear them talking in your serenity out in the background behind you saying is this really a thing?
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:57.740]   This is really make a difference and then she moves around to another but and I can totally appreciate that
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:01.740]   Uh the same way that you know, I could I when I watched hd
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:05.740]   During the transition I had to go back to looking at my parents crt display
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.780]   I could tell it wasn't bad for some shows. I really didn't care
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:12.380]   You know like the local news and things like that and that's how I feel right now
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.780]   It's like the best of it is amazing
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:19.660]   Some of it does does not make a big deal to me, but I look forward three or four years
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:24.220]   And I think going back i'll be like people used to listen to music like this. What were we animals?
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.700]   So i'm actually i'm actually more in some more excited about it
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.940]   And i'll try to make this really short because it's something i'm going to be
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:34.460]   I'm preparing something long writing about it. I'm actually more
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:40.060]   Excited about spatial audio finally as a way of doing audio ar i've always thought that
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:45.740]   Ar glasses are not the way to go the way to go are earbuds that can let you talk to a
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.580]   Voice assistant and get your information and your inputs and i'll put that way
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:54.300]   But imagine being able to say hey, where is the uh, how do i how do I get to?
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:08:00.860]   How do i get to the post office and actually we'll put a ping like behind you and to the left saying turn around until like this
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:03.660]   Is actually in front of you. That's the direction down the street you need to go
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:08.860]   That's i'm not i'm not as we said last week. I mean i'm not terribly excited about it as a musical thing yet
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:12.140]   Unless i upgrade my headphones, but it's a great technology
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:16.780]   I just think they could be used in interesting and unexpected ways you shouldn't by the way i have to update your headphones
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.020]   That's i guess what i'm saying is
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.940]   Uh, it worked fine
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:24.140]   Cummings you have to tell your iphone always use spatial
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:29.820]   Because it because otherwise it talks to the headphones is can you do atmos and the headphones go no and then you go?
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:30.860]   Okay, well, we'll just
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:36.300]   Stereo head tracking unless you have the head tracking is dopey. I'm sorry. I don't see any point to head tracking
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:41.820]   So the tv's here and i get in my head the sound moves to the right is dumb
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:46.220]   I don't it makes it it makes headphones work the way speakers work. That's essentially the only
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:53.660]   I don't see that was the original use of spatial. I never really saw the point of that but I am interested in
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:57.820]   A sound that is more authentic i guess
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:03.020]   So you do have to turn dopey atmos always on in the sound setting and the music settings
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:07.820]   And then you can use any pair of headphones. I used a good quality deck
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:11.500]   And as i said just regular headphones and you definitely hear the difference it's there
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:14.300]   um, so i don't
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:17.980]   I guess is the phone or the ipad or the mac doing the decoding
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:24.700]   I guess so and send and turning it into some sort of binaural representation for the headphones
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:29.500]   I think they describe that it's not it's based on time like the time of the signal
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:33.180]   Yeah, uh when they time the different parts of your ear thinks that they're further or closer away
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:36.860]   Yeah, so they mess with the timing of when all the different things are being played
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:39.660]   It also is the pretty minute scales
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:45.420]   According according to scooter x that apple does say you need adobe atmos decoding
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:51.660]   Receiver it can't just be doleby apparently which is doppy because i've always thought doleby atmos was dopy
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.660]   You have to have downward firing speakers
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.700]   Uh, that's the difference i mean they kind of
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:01.500]   They've they've kind of flattened that down so they can simply they can they're really good at simulating 3d sound stages now
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.260]   So the original one was very manual like you had to actually point the speakers like different directions
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:09.500]   And now they build these 3d sound stages using the same kind of digital tricks that they're using for headphones
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:13.100]   Well if dobe hadn't tarnished its name by selling
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:19.020]   the the phrase doleby to a bunch of crappy speakers on laptops i might have been more
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.300]   I might have been more encouraged by it. Uh, i've never
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:28.780]   Spent them. I have dobe surround. I just don't have dobe atmos also because I don't want to put speakers in my ceiling
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:35.820]   Um, it's it's weird that apple is leaning so heavily on dobe for both dobe vision on the iphone and dobe atmos
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:41.180]   You know with all the audio stuff because they have their own versions like the app because they can't always count on you having a dobe thing
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:46.620]   At the end or having a dobe stream, you know coming in so they do their own spatial audio. I think they just
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:51.180]   There's no standard for any of this stuff. So they're leaning on on dobe to
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:57.660]   I don't know what the right word is commoditize the experience. Yeah, that's a good word for it. It's a very good word for it
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:04.300]   So well they were better. They were substantially better than the pre like hdr 10 was not good until dobe vision came out
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.580]   Dobe vision is better. I agree. Dobe vision is quite good. I agree
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:15.260]   Um, so what i'm getting from this is that dobe atmos is a new kind of dobe that may or may not require
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.900]   uh downward firing speakers
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:22.620]   But everything else is different too. It's not dobe stereo or dobe
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.420]   surround plus
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:30.940]   Speakers up there it's not dependent anymore. It's like I understand they don't have to worry it like is it 9.1
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:36.220]   Is if I don't have and it is no, no, no, if I don't have downward or upward bouncing speakers
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:40.380]   Will dobe atmos sounding different than dobe dobe surround
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:46.700]   Yeah, because they're they're doing all that understanding of where that 3d sound space understand like again
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:51.180]   Audio files will spend the money because no, I have real dobe atmos. I have the actual physical
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:56.060]   You know sound waves blasting off my ceiling. So now I have to get the whole pods where like the receiver. I guess
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:03.740]   If you care about it from your from all like you could put on headphones and listen to it on your iPhone. Yeah, I mean, it's
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:08.540]   Uh weird. It sounds good. I think it's good. It's it's more it's more open
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:14.300]   It sounds more open. It's the best way I can describe it. So uh, and what with the airpods pro
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:17.420]   It sounds like it's in your skull and then with the airpods max. It sounds like you're inside the
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:21.180]   Yes, exactly. That's a good way to describe it. And that's always been the problem
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.740]   With the headphones
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:27.100]   In general is you know the the very close nature of the sound
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:33.260]   Makes you feel like it's in your head and some people don't like that actually. I don't I don't mind the headphones and i've listened
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.420]   Yeah
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:43.740]   Restrictive so i'm gonna have to uh, okay. I'm gonna have to rethink about what dobe atmos is. It sounds like it's a new kind of encoding
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:48.380]   It's like hdr for audio like dobe, dobe, dobe, vision
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.180]   I'm I'm butchering this and everyone at dobe is gonna be super angry at me
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:55.980]   But like dobe vision just gives you rich your detail in your v in your video and dobe atmos because you rich are like
[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:57.820]   more
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.820]   More 3d space in your audio
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:06.860]   So this is from what high fight calm atmos is a surround sound technology was originally developed in 2012
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:13.740]   It expands upon the existing 517 on surround sound setups with surround channels coming from overhead
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:17.100]   Um
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:24.380]   Which is was always my understanding, but what I missed was if you don't have speakers overhead it will simulate that in some form
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:29.180]   And that's what 9.1 just wasn't practical for like most humans. Yeah
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:33.340]   Um, okay
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:40.060]   Okay, so I think I think it like think about it as an abstraction layer instead of having like this is dobe atmos and here the
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:41.900]   9.1 speakers you need to play it
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:47.580]   It's like this is dobe atmos and we'll figure out how you get the 3d soundstage with whatever equipment you happen to have attached
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:53.020]   I just need to get a new receiver because I don't have anything that can decode that I do have the earpud
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:58.300]   Max pro max. They're not very good. So that's really why I
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:01.900]   You know I use it for which is great is like FaceTime calls is great
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:06.460]   But other than that voice is fine, but it's not good for music
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:09.180]   In my opinion, um, all right
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:13.820]   We're we're talking about and eddy q says you can't hear the difference
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:18.380]   You can't tell the difference in loss. You can't handle it. You can't handle it. Don't worry about it
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:24.140]   Don't worry about it. Let's take a little break more to come andi and ako rene richy
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:29.340]   Our show brought to you by udacity. I know you're smart and you want to learn. I know
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:34.540]   That's one of the reasons we do these shows I want to learn and you listen to them because you want to learn
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:39.660]   Well, here's a great way to learn to get the skills that the tech companies want

[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:45.580]   But then you're going to have to put the what you've learned to end to action
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:48.620]   hands-on project based active learning
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:51.260]   on cutting edge technology

[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:09.500]   Okay
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.620]   Apple design award winners we talked about the nominees
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.820]   We have the winners i'm not going to run through all of these because
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:22.780]   With great effort ros may orchard and mica sergeant did that on ios today you should watch that
[01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:26.380]   Because there are a lot of winners
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:31.580]   Any anything you guys want to highlight i use novo which is great. That's a mac
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:35.420]   Editor app that i really love i think panic software is so good
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:36.860]   Oh
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.860]   But this is so there go ahead
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:41.260]   I just wanted to praise panic that there i
[01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:49.500]   I spoke earlier about how certain developers individual developers are like the justice league some are some developments companies are like
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.060]   Tiffany's
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.500]   You know
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:19:00.460]   Myvoc whatever the whenever the the the companies that you always whatever they they produce even if it's not something you have any possible use for
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.980]   You're not necessarily going to buy it
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:07.980]   But you're going to take a look at the demo in the videos because they just understand the beauty and the specificity of a mac
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:14.380]   Or ios happen their definite panic is definitely on that list. Oh, amazing. Yeah, there by the way did they announce you're going to
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:18.540]   I was funny on I asked a couple of weeks ago. Whatever happened to that crank
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:21.180]   video game player that they were going to put out
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:25.900]   And uh, did they they apparently have an announcement video, huh? Yep
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.540]   Wasn't you lonely sandwich video out about it?
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.940]   so
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:37.980]   Is it coming out? I I think I played it played it. Yeah, they said that they said that the pre-order is going to be opening in july
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.300]   Oh, I thought I did and there's okay
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.820]   Don't know. I don't I don't think so but also they also i'm i've never been excited about a game platform
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:47.820]   But i'm really excited about this one
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:51.820]   Because they showed off just they showed off the video was a little bit more expansive
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:56.700]   There's also a new a new desktop or nightstand accessory that's a speaker and a pen holder
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:02.780]   And it does you get a free pen with it, which seems just as silly and ridiculous as i would expect from the playdate
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:09.180]   Uh, it's the idea of if it's the price has gone up. I think it used to be announced at 150
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.740]   I think it's gone for 179. That's fine
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.660]   But the idea of getting just having these a new game
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:22.780]   A season of games just like a season of ted lasso where a new game just simply wirelessly appears on this device once a week
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:29.580]   And the fact that these developers are designing for the specific and quirky piece of hardware and not the usual
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:36.380]   Hey, here is your usual like widescreen color touch screen that could be a compute could be a desktop could be a notebook
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.780]   Could be a handheld could be a phone. It's like no
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:45.900]   The the device the hardware is going to is going to define the experience. Uh, i'm really excited about this. It's very retro
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.860]   I mean black and white it's kind of pixelated
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:52.780]   You got a crank on the side, which I don't think anybody's ever done that before
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:59.100]   So that's that's what that's what gets me excited because it's I think that I think even didn't in the initial look
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:05.100]   announcement they specifically said no fishing games because that's the one thing that you definitely think don't worry
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:11.260]   They're just they're not even telling people developers how to use it. It's just like here is here is a handheld
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:16.380]   There is a fold-out crank on the side of it do with that what you will and you can develop your own apps for it
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:20.860]   Your own games for it. So I feel as though this is going to be a piece of relaxing fun for me
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:25.740]   Either as a completely like out of his element gamer or just as hey look
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:33.260]   I've got this cool handheld device with a battery Wi-Fi bluetooth and a screen and I probably am just smart enough to know how to program this
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.940]   Play dot date pre-orders next month. Okay
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:42.140]   Yeah, I've definitely I thought I pre-ordered it maybe I just thought I will pre-order it
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.940]   It's like who did I give that money to?
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:52.380]   I love there's a lot of little cameos in the video like you see morgan and you see just a lot of the people you recognize from panic twitter
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.620]   Oh nice. Oh, that's great
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:58.540]   See again. This is this is why they are just so such superstars
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:02.620]   They're they're you wouldn't think that panic would create the untitled goose game or firework
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:06.380]   But this but this is the mindset they're they're like they're a design house
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:10.700]   Like a great design house is that you don't you don't understand you think that they're okay
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:15.420]   Well, they make handbags. Well, no, they're a design house and one thing excuse me. I'm even better like apple
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:20.700]   They are design studio. They're not necessarily a technology company. It's just that they they
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:28.940]   Articulate their sense of design and their understanding of the interaction between humanity and the world around them by making these products
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:31.500]   And so I'm sorry. I'm going I'm getting a little bit
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.460]   It's fine
[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:38.940]   Uncomfortable. They're kind of I want to send the money. That's what I'm saying. I know I do
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:41.580]   Shut up and take my money panic
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:47.500]   They uh, they're they're kind of a legacy like like rich seagull kind of a legacy Mac developer panics transmit was
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:51.580]   A very early FTP. I mean, I think the only thing older than that was phyto
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:54.140]   And uh, very and really good
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:56.700]   I too like client in there
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:59.420]   Uh, they did in fact, I think they did
[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:02.700]   Somebody said they did
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.620]   Double twist. Is that right? Is that my
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:12.220]   No, I believe like they had a competitor to what apple ended up buying and turning into it. Oh, yeah
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:17.900]   Yeah, and of course, I've used as as we said, they they've done uh, they did coda, which was a great
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.460]   Which now they by the way sun said it
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:23.180]   Sound jam sound jam. That's right
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:29.020]   And um, and they've replaced that with the nova the unfortunately the ipad code
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.420]   Which I do use is going
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:34.620]   Sound jam is what apple bot and turned into iTunes. That's right. Oh, that's right
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.780]   Audion
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.780]   Oh, audion was great
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:44.940]   Yeah, was that damn audion. Yeah, and then apple bot sound jam. Yeah, they're gonna put audion out of business
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:47.180]   So anyway back to the design winners
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.860]   Sorry
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:53.980]   In the delight and fun category. I want a feeling without a sponsored announcement. Yeah, I'm really

[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:10.140]   Uh must be because it's iphone ipad and apple tv. That's I think it was one of the yeah one of the announced games in the big trailer for arcade
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.220]   Oh, okay, and then pock pock

[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.620]   category, so i'm not sure i'm
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.940]   interpreting this properly
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:37.420]   Congratulations to all the apple design award winners that's got to be huge for
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:43.100]   Uh, an app to get that because that just people are going to pay attention to it
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:53.660]   Yeah, in fact one of the apps that got that some years ago, which is one of my favorite apps on mac and ios day one has just been sold
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:55.660]   Um
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:26:02.780]   Day one, which is a journaling program. Yeah, really beautiful journaling program apple design award winner apple dators choice app of the year
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:08.780]   It's it's secure. It works on the accolades. It works on the watch. It works on the mac
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:15.020]   It works on your iphone and ipad and uh automatic just bought them, which actually I think is great
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:19.660]   i'm a big fan of matt maulin weg the automatic, uh, of course is the
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.380]   commercial side of word press
[01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:29.660]   And matt wrote word press and he's turned automatic into a really great company. That's a very it's a very harmonious acquisition
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:34.060]   I think so it's like it's like there's sometimes sometimes there's an acquisition and you wonder okay
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:38.620]   I guess they just wanted to hire the people that work for there or I guess they just wanted to get this off the market
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:45.180]   There but there are those rare times where there was uh, there was a day one sized hole in automatic
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:48.140]   And that perfectly drops into it and makes it more complete
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:52.460]   So paul main who's really pretty much single-handedly been doing day one for
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:55.020]   a decade
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:27:01.340]   Um, uh, says he's going to continue the team is going to continue automatic is just going to give them money and autonomy
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:07.260]   And this is one case where I believe that word press dot com and tumblr are the other automatic
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.420]   um
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:12.060]   Enterprises and I think day one fits in quite nicely
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:17.020]   With that in fact a tumblr inter integration might be great where you could say hey this journal post
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:21.820]   I'd like to make public on tumblr or word press that would be great. Yeah, so good job
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:26.380]   Matt and uh good job paul. I'm glad uh, I'm glad you got acquired
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:29.980]   Yeah, don't know for how much but I hope it was a billion dollars
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:35.180]   Sitting on a beach running 20 percent. I certainly hope that's the case
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:38.780]   And I've been using day one probably for 10 years. I've been paying for it
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.420]   Since day one since day one
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:43.900]   Absolutely
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:48.380]   Anyway, that's uh, that's that's an example of an apple design winner going on to fame fortune
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:53.980]   Renee congratulations on still being so quick whitted after a full week of your schedule at ww dc
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:57.260]   I am impressed. You are the iron man of this industry
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:04.540]   Serenity did at grace being serenity did a great job summarizing each. I didn't realize she was like in charge of all content at apple
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.300]   She's like her and it called well. She's like the developer. Yeah the developer app. She's there
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:11.660]   She's our developer app evangelist. I probably got that wrong. She's gonna
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:14.860]   rollerblade roller skate chop me, but um
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:20.220]   She does all the stuff in the developer app and so she did the daily summaries like she did last year
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:25.100]   And actually her me moji did it. I don't know how much she had to do with it actually it might have been the me moji
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:31.420]   And and hairstyle game was so on point this year though. Like it changed every video
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:37.980]   Uh, all right, well, now we can now now we got a look at it. I'm wait a minute. I just gotta see here
[01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:41.740]   So this is monday apples youtube channel. You can see the whole row of
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:44.380]   Hey, everyone. I'm serenity call bullet apple. That's last year. I think
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.940]   Was this last year
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.940]   It is 2020
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:51.260]   So let's see the I want to see the more modern ones here it is
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:55.740]   I think she had a different hat mamochi hat every day. Did she oh yeah, here we go. Here's this
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:58.460]   This is a day two
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:02.460]   Buckle up your day two recap starts now. I think i've seen her wear that hat though. That's a real
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:04.940]   Surrender into helmet though. I mean, yeah
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.900]   Well, the last one is in all of your
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:12.380]   Let me let me go back to their uh, is the last one. Oh it is
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.860]   Day five
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:16.860]   Uh, let's see there she is
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:19.580]   Okay, a lot enough
[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:26.940]   She's great good for you. God. I'm just thrilled to see you do so well. Nice hairstyle there. That's good
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:29.740]   two one
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:32.940]   I was definitely one of those hires where I
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:37.500]   Yeah, definitely one of those hires where not only it's it's I do say good for serenity
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:42.300]   But even more schwanncy. Oh good for apple. Oh, what a great hire. That is. Yeah, it's like yeah
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:45.500]   Does she appear on camera any of them or is it all mamochi?
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:49.020]   Um, emoji. I think it's all mamochi
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:52.220]   Here we go. So that's a good one top one
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:30:00.380]   Your day three recap here we go former i'm more app editor alik has muha has appeared in session videos both this year and last
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:04.060]   Here because she is the engineering program manager on game center now
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:09.660]   So these recaps are worth watching they're not very long or are they
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:16.620]   Um, they're great. I mean it's a minute. They're very quick. Did you miss day one at dub dub?
[01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:20.620]   Well, let's go back in time. So in a minute you can get you know
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:24.060]   Basics
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:27.660]   She has advanced access to the schedule as if she knew ahead of time
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.380]   What was gonna happen?
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:32.380]   These are snappy attack
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.660]   They put a lot of effort into these they move move move wow
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:40.780]   I also I also am very curious about that I would love to see the backstage tools that they use to create
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:44.940]   Not just like the the mamochi that we get access to with with live animation
[01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:49.660]   But when they need to burn like a high quality 4k mamochi for this kind of purpose
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:55.340]   What tools do they use do they actually start with uh like a live recording that they then
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:02.620]   Post process or there's that I bet there's a lot of really cool tools behind the there because they use that tool so many oftentimes so
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.100]   often sorry
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:11.500]   The audience Tim cook had a whole audience of mamochi's all animated at the same time that like a version of massive from
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:15.100]   From the hobbit, but purpose built from emoji
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:19.500]   No, I thought I was I was going for minions when I first saw him walk out on stage, but
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:22.380]   It's the same point. They do look like minions
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:30.940]   Is that technology? It lets you have a variety of different looking things all you doing like natural behavior instead of being like a bunch of robots
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:34.620]   Each one is doing something different but doing it at scale, which is always you know fun
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:39.580]   Uh june 15th of 2021 the first day
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:47.420]   That every single apple store in the world has been open simultaneously for over 75 weeks
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:50.860]   I think if you're gonna pick one
[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:57.900]   News item that says covid is over that's it. Wow at least in the united states. Yeah. Well, this is worldwide though
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:02.860]   I mean, really well, there's an apple store is like in india and that's true some of the hot spots
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:08.540]   You can you can you can extend it for another month so really interesting graphic here showing
[01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:15.340]   Uh the number of apple stores that were open then suddenly as you can see with the with the
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:23.020]   This is uh in march of 2020 nothing and then going back up and down and up and down and up and down
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.820]   But we're back to 511
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:32.860]   Stores, uh, that's good. That's good. Oh, I think Sydney's not open because uh
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:36.700]   They're working on it or something
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:40.460]   Uh, let's see what else what other news? Um
[01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:45.500]   If you were hoping to get that apple tv plus trial
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.300]   For a year
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:52.220]   It's starting next month. They're going to reduce it to three months with hardware purchase
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:57.580]   I don't know if that indicates they're producing content again that that's time to you know, it's time to get it
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:03.020]   Yeah, because we were getting rebates every month. I guess that'll end. Yeah, because they couldn't make anything right
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:04.620]   Right
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:10.540]   The uh free year trial was extended twice for an additional nine months free, but that's going to all expire next month
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:15.580]   You're gonna have to start paying for apple tv plus I won't even notice because I buy apple one and so i won't even
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:22.380]   Yeah, just and now we get all the the iCloud plus stuff to you. I know i'm like, what is that rollout? Do we know yet?
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:29.260]   Uh, I got asked for to enable it when I put the beta on so I don't know what level of deployment it's at
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:31.980]   But if you they asked me and I said, yep, yep hide all that IP stuff
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:38.700]   So you're in a beta for uh, not just the operating system, but for iCloud plus that's interesting
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:44.540]   Yeah, you're gonna get that new like they're just that it's it's not not quite a vpn not quite tor
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:49.500]   Uh, but it is basically a privatizing browsing experience in safari
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:54.220]   It doesn't do tunneling and it doesn't do geo hopping the way of vpn does but what it does do is
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:34:00.460]   Uh on your side as you make a query it wraps that query in encryption and sends it to an apple-owned
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:07.020]   Relay and that relay removes your ip and gives you a temporary ip that you can choose whether it's loosely
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:09.580]   Geographically based like you could choose bay area for example
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:13.980]   So you still get relevant search results for your local area or you could choose like usa
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:16.060]   Like if you don't want any sort of information attached
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:21.660]   It sends that to a second relay, which is not owned by apple, which is like cloud flare or, um another
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:24.220]   big commercial
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:30.300]   internet junction and that unencrypts it and sends the request so apple doesn't know where you're going
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:32.540]   And that relay doesn't know where you were
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:37.900]   Uh, and the website only gets that obfuscated, um, that obfuscated, uh ip address
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:43.020]   And you you sort of have you can't be the whole point of this is that these profiles, you know
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:47.020]   If leo if you go shopping for i think apple's example was if you go shopping for a couch
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:53.100]   Uh, it takes the information from your ip it looks up all its partner friends that it buys and sells data from and says oh
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.340]   We sent, uh leo a lamp
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:59.820]   You know the other day from that ip address who now we know his address and he signed up for this e newsletter
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:01.660]   So now we know his email as well
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:05.900]   And it puts all this together and then you leave that place and you go to another
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:09.660]   Website and it shows you that that couch and then a few days later
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:13.500]   You get a pamphlet on a coupon rebate for that couch in your mailbox
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:18.700]   And then you start looking through these profiles and it's like oh like this is a website leo the ghost is in the movies
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:22.620]   He likes this is a furniture. He has high end tastes he's in this age demo
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:27.340]   And they want to shut like they they want you to be able to give that information if you want to but they don't want anybody
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:30.300]   Assembling an entire shadow profile on on their own
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:37.180]   Yeah, it's about if my my take after trying to understand more about it over the past year and certainly vernay can correct me if i'm wrong
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.820]   Is that conceptually this is not about anonymity. This is just about privacy
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:46.300]   Yeah, that's a way to pee in a tour. That's a good way to pee in a tour. That's a good way to pee in a tour
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:49.500]   Or about total anonymity. Yeah, that's a that's a good way to put it
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.700]   Do uh, I asked you on sunday. I don't know if you know now
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:56.380]   Uh the third party that you're getting i've seen some people report
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:01.020]   Uh, they're getting cloud front as the non apple third party in the exit
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:03.580]   It's actually clever than that it's they have a pool
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:08.620]   And they they're gonna have an internal pool and an external pool eventually. I don't believe the internal pool is fully functionally yet
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.780]   Like it goes to apple, but there's like
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:13.980]   Six, I think external relays one of them is cloud flare
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:18.540]   And then you uh you get sent a bunch of tokens that are redeemable for any of those
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:19.740]   Um
[01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:26.140]   Those servers. I don't think you get to choose but it will randomize it so that even if you do successive sessions
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:28.940]   There's no guarantee you're even going to be coming from the same relay on those those
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:33.900]   That's good. That means your ip address will really be pretty random. It won't it won't be repeatable in other words
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:37.980]   Uh, that's good multiple people will be using the same ip addresses over time
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:41.980]   Right, so they'll just not be able to trust the data that they're getting from it at all. All right, right
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:47.260]   Of course, I may be getting rene's couch offers from now on, but that's okay. Yes
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:50.620]   Uh, one way you may have they have sessions like to their credit
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:55.500]   They have really in-depth sessions about how app developers and web developers can work with these frameworks
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:58.540]   And they're also creating a bunch of secure private frameworks
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:03.740]   That for example, you can get sent a token saying that somebody acted on what your advertisement was
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:06.700]   Outside of the ad networks it creates a direct relationship
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:11.660]   Uh or like they're saying you're going to get 100 percent open rate for all of your newsletters from now on
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:16.700]   And you're not going to know where they were or what device they were doing or whether they actually opened it or not
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:19.660]   But here's the frameworks that you can use to still you know get the data
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:23.660]   Think about not the data you want but the data you really need and these other frameworks
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:27.180]   Well apple decides what you really need. So that's not exactly
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:31.340]   What you really need, uh, that's an important point on this uh mail
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:33.580]   uh change is
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.820]   And you described this on sunday and it kind of surprised me
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:39.260]   Uh, a lot of mail clients block tracking pixels
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:44.940]   So that there's just no information you get an opener close or anything that pixel never it looks like it never was opened
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:49.820]   The way apple's doing it is very different. They are opening every single newsletter
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.980]   On their servers
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:57.420]   And then sending it along to you so you get 100 percent open rate as opposed to a zero percent open
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:58.540]   Yeah
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:00.540]   They said that they first of all like the
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.460]   They typically use machine learning to figure out the tracking pixel is and it's not close to 100
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:10.060]   Percent it's not always accurate and there's sometimes multiple tracking because but also it breaks the the content of the mail quite often
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:15.900]   And you see things differently because people are really smart about making the tracking pixel critical. Yeah to the email
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:23.260]   No, I so this gives you all my newsletters look crappy because I have and I recommend everybody use an email client that doesn't support html and images
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:27.340]   That's just dangerous. It's just stupid and it looks horrible. Yeah. Yeah
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:31.900]   But you know what if you do a newsletter that requires that I'm not going to read it. Yeah
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:34.060]   Sorry
[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:40.060]   Uh, yeah, but so so apple's going to do it sounds like what apple's trying to do is figure out which
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:45.020]   Which things which is the tracking pixel and then open the rest of it or show you at least show you the rest of it
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:50.060]   Well, so your email still looks good. Yeah, so there's no way for them to miss the tracking pixel
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:53.180]   But because well, basically they're they're proxying the the images
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:57.180]   So you get a copy from apple instead of from the newsletter so they don't need a tracking pixel only gets
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:00.940]   Yeah, you don't need to know what the tracking pixel is you're getting everything but you're not getting it
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:05.500]   You're getting a proxied version of it. Yeah, just for breaking the yeah, they're breaking their question. Yeah, they're breaking the chain
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:11.900]   Very interesting. By the way, if you do want to get apple tv plus for free. There is still one way
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:15.820]   It's a it's a sadaoku game called zoshi plus
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:22.540]   Apparently despite the fact that it's screenshots and app description on the app store look like a sadaoku client
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.940]   If you launch the app
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:31.420]   It's a thousands of movies and tv shows you stream illegally for free including apples on apple tv plus
[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:38.140]   Stuff and I guess people are figuring it out because it's been rising up the charts. It just got pulled
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:43.820]   Uh from the app store apple apple said whoa hold on there's zoshi plus
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:46.620]   So
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:49.420]   Maybe maybe people you know you might want to think about
[01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:56.140]   installing I think twice about installing apps that do that kind of thing because if they're doing that to
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:40:00.860]   Other companies maybe they're doing something to you too and with iOS 15
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:06.060]   You can press a button saying log all app activity for seven days and then press another button saying report and you can see exactly
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:09.820]   What they're doing with all the data. They're pulling off of you while you're watching. Yeah while you're stealing
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:12.140]   What are they stealing from you?
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:18.380]   It got up to uh, it was on the app store for three weeks got up to 50th on the puzzle games download charts
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:25.660]   User reviews dated as far back as june fourth discuss the pirate functionality openly according to line to five mac
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:28.460]   It's really good because I can watch shows that are on netflix
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:32.140]   It's a sadoku app though. I thought
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:34.140]   Uh one
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:39.020]   User review says they discover the app in a tiktok video which has more than 2.6 million views
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.420]   So the word gets out that's for sure
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:44.540]   Uh and the word got out and apple has yanked it
[01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:46.780]   So bye bye
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:49.020]   Bye bye. That's I cloud. I'm sorry. I like my
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:52.380]   Bye bye. So it sounds like we're gonna get the benefits of iCloud plus
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:59.820]   When we get the new version of the operating system. Yes. Yeah, yeah, it's big. That's a good way to roll it out actually
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:02.060]   So you slow roll
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:04.140]   Makes a lot of sense
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:09.980]   Let's see the beat studio buds are out if you want them yay
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:14.460]   For android people and non apple like phone users and apple users
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:19.980]   Active noise cancellation 149.99 will work with yes and ride
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:22.940]   Uh, I have heard people say that it does not
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:29.100]   The noise cancellation ain't great. I have to say the noise cancel might go pick of the week, but you want me to spoil?
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:33.340]   Oh don't spoil it never mind. I didn't say anything edit that all out
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:36.380]   Forget I mentioned it
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:38.700]   I can tell you now
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.700]   Forget I know save it
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:43.340]   uh, let's see
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:45.740]   I think I'm just uh
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:50.380]   Do you have anything to say about the watch because we really have done scant coverage of
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:55.980]   Uh new features in the watch there is a rumor that the new watch will be thicker
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:42:03.020]   Um, I guess is that a good lady does will mark says the the rumors been delayed a year. Oh
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:06.140]   The rumor is delayed
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:08.540]   How about the watch is that now a 2022 rumor?
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:12.540]   Oh, so the thicker one is not going to be this year
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:15.260]   Apple watch series seven
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:20.540]   Will according to mark have a new design, but that's now he's saying that's next year
[01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:26.540]   Yeah, and there'll be an act an a rugged model for like, you know outdoor athletes and
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:32.460]   We're still not any closer to blood sugar because that's so hard. That's just yeah really really hard. Yeah, like blood body temperature
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:36.940]   Um, that's some someones are castically replied to going isn't that called a thermometer?
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:42.460]   You you run with one of those things jammed up your you know what that's fine. Yeah
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:44.460]   Uh
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:48.380]   There's one there's one company that thinks that they were going to have a noninvasive. I think
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:53.100]   Spectographic blood sugar analyzer ready next year
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:56.380]   Which means that would be at least another year before we get into any
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:43:00.620]   Risk risk devices if it would be even and that
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:06.860]   Have to get FDA appropriate for yeah because that's a that becomes a medical device. It's such a double
[01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:12.860]   Go ahead. Sorry. I asked I asked about it a couple years ago and the answer was like we really want it
[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:17.260]   We tried doing it. We've bought three or four companies that promised they were only a year away from doing it
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:21.020]   It turns out no they were way more than a year away from doing it because it's really hard
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:24.540]   And we keep trying we keep buying companies, but you know, it's gonna take a while
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:27.980]   At this page every time it turns up in research papers
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:35.420]   It does not turn up in terms of like actual functional hardware. So I did like this apple watch explorer edition. I like the idea
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.060]   But that'll be next year
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:40.300]   According to the rumors 2022
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:44.860]   That would be that is such a great step for apple to take and maybe long delayed one
[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:49.820]   Because the number of people who have been who opposed to the forms of here's what here's what happened when
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:55.500]   Here's here's what happened when there when I was going rock climbing and the bezel gets all scratched up
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:44:01.660]   Here's what happened when something got stepped on there are a lot of people who really need if there's an active lifestyle watch
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.820]   With support for active
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:08.220]   Roles in your life. So if they're people who would spend extra for like a G-Shock version
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:10.460]   Absolutely. Yeah
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:11.580]   Absolutely
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:16.300]   Uh, will there be a new watch this year then or what does that mean?
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.300]   Is it mean rene? They're putting off
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:23.580]   That they think there will be new watches next year, but not this year or it's just these new features
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:29.180]   Just the redesign and the rugged thing. I mean, it they've always done and you watch every year
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:31.180]   And it's just a command to me. No, they have it. Have they?
[01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:36.620]   Yeah, yeah, every the first year was 18 months because you know, they introduced new version of watch to us
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:40.860]   But after that every september with a new eye flowing except for last year where they did september, october
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:46.140]   There's a new apple watch and I always liken it to some people complain that the difference isn't big enough
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:51.260]   But like apple has they don't think everybody buys a new watch like we do but not most people 80
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:55.340]   90 percent of the market do not buy new devices every year they can afford a seven years
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.060]   Yeah
[01:44:56.060 --> 01:45:01.500]   On the device and the analogy I use is like a bakery when you go to a bakery you expect fresh bread
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:06.620]   And like if I buy on tuesday you buy on thursday, we should both still get fresh bread
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:09.180]   Um, so apples like it's their responsibility
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:14.940]   I think to make sure that any year that you choose to buy you get the absolute best product that will last you the absolute longest
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:20.460]   Amount of time possible so whether it's just an updated system in package like an s7 or whatever they do this year
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:27.100]   The screen technology gets slightly better battery life gets slightly better even incremental updates are really important to the people who are buying that year
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:29.580]   Even if it's not to you who bought last year
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:36.380]   And of course the e3 virtually three has been going on the big gaming conference is a lot of gaming news
[01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:44.140]   There's one I thought you might be interested in rene richy the folks at niantic who do ingress and pokémon go have announced
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:49.900]   Uh on the heels of their I think is it safe to say the harry potter game was kind of a failure
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:56.540]   Uh on the heels that's fair. Yeah, they're gonna do the next one is going to come out later this year transformers
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:59.340]   heavy metal
[01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:02.220]   And uh, so it'll be transformers out in the real world
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:05.020]   See what bumblebee is up to
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:11.500]   I'm gonna have to enter my my birthday because like I think they were they were successful with pokemon because it was a
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:16.060]   Beloved, uh, you know nostalgic ip intellectual property
[01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:20.540]   And it was a it was the advent of location based gaming because ingress was very nerdy
[01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:25.500]   Didn't have any franchise value to drive you know attachment to it and then they tried with harry potter
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:30.540]   But like it makes no sound like you can catch a million pikachu's like there's a that that makes total sense in pokémon
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:36.060]   What are you gonna do catch a million haggards? I'm gonna hunt down a million bumblebees. It makes no in universe contextual sense
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:38.780]   to me like how
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:43.660]   Harry potter ended up being the worst most tedious aspects of pokémon it was it was just the things I don't like about the game
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:48.380]   Yeah, and that was all you could do. Yeah, I just I fear that they're taking the wrong lessons from these games
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:49.420]   Yeah
[01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:54.780]   They say a beta test betas will be out soon you could sign up at the website transformers heavy metal dot com
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:57.580]   um, yeah, I mean clearly
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:01.820]   Uh from nyantic the value now with this platform is
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:08.940]   Licensing, you know, yeah, because I imagine they're getting paid by transformers not vice versa, but I don't know who knows
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:16.140]   Maybe not maybe maybe they had to pay heavy heavy metal for that uh for that title. I don't know
[01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:22.460]   Uh, all right. Let's take a break. Well, there is one more story from bloomberg
[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:28.860]   Well, where would we be without mark german apple has hired a former bmw executive
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:32.060]   For the apple car product
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:35.420]   Hmm
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:39.260]   Uh they hired oolik crunts
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:41.740]   Wait, did we do this we've done this story?
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:47.980]   Did we do this story? He was the guy with the skinny jeans keep hiring maybe there's somebody else okay
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:53.980]   No, he's not the skinny jeans guy that was uh that was from another company. That was a portion of our portion
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:48:00.060]   That's right. Yeah. Wow. That's interesting former senior executive at bmw's ag electric car division
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.060]   He will be
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:07.020]   Uh, I don't know what his title will be will he be leading? I don't know he was a senior vice president
[01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:11.340]   Um at bmw and then founded canoe
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:15.020]   You may remember canoe had this really interesting
[01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:20.540]   Idea to kind of a car as self driving vehicle you couldn't buy but you could rent
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:22.940]   Or lease
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:25.340]   So he left canoe and apple snapped him up
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:29.980]   That you're wanting to do as they are want to do
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:32.140]   Yep

[01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:09.980]   Often don't answer my phone anymore. Why tnt wants to change that our show today sponsored by

[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.660]   Self-serving plugs if you don't mind
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:35.980]   We are going on a cruise to Alaska Andy. I've I've had great times with you on those geek cruises
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:40.700]   I would not be on the show if we are not met on the geek cruise and you had short-handed for mac break
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:46.460]   Yes, I think that's right actually I remember stalking you in mac world expo, but that's maybe that was a separate event
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:49.580]   That was you
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:52.300]   If you go to cruises.tuit.tv
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:54.140]   We have decided to pick up the mantle
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:51:00.380]   Uh, Neil doesn't do the geek cruises anymore. He does scientific american cruises and stuff like that
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:02.940]   So we thought you know travel store called us and said
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:08.940]   What about a twit cruise and I thought and thought about it and Lisa and I talked and we said yeah, you know what let's give it a try
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:15.020]   So this will be our inaugural cruise. It's to Alaska. It's next year. Don't worry. It's not this year in 2022
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:18.060]   I just wanted to mention this to put this on your calendar
[01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:20.860]   July 16 through 23
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:23.500]   2022
[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:28.700]   Uh, we're gonna have a number of events. We'll be talking to people if enough people sign up. We can invite somebody else
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:30.780]   hint hint
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:34.060]   Uh, it starts in Seattle. It's in in out of Seattle
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:39.340]   We will cruise the steven's passage. You've got to see the glaciers. They're so gorgeous. We'll go to juneau
[01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:41.180]   glacier bay
[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:44.060]   I see straight point alaska sitka ketchikan
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:48.060]   On the way home. We stop in victoria, which is a beautiful stop
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:50.380]   What a pretty city
[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:54.780]   And uh, that'll be fun. And then we end up in seattle on saturday july 23rd come with us
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:57.260]   if you want to know more go to cruise
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:51:59.740]   Dot twit dot tv
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:04.860]   And you know if this goes well, uh, it could be the beginning of the start of something big
[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:08.380]   I'd like to bring back the geek cruises. I thought that was a lot of fun
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:10.940]   Yeah, really enjoyed doing those
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:15.900]   Because you know you get a bunch of people and I don't know it was 50 60 a hundred something like that
[01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:20.540]   Depending that different cruises had different number of people, but we would all be together. We'd eat together
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:23.580]   We'd always have uh cocktails before dinner
[01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:30.060]   in one of the lounges and it would just was really a fun time to get together and talk to like-minded geeks. So
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:33.580]   It's we'll see if we could bring that bring that back
[01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:41.180]   Uh, and then uh, the other thing I want to mention which is kind of related is club twit. We're doing what we can to
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:44.300]   uh, make twit more
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.820]   um
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:51.340]   Successful july say it was a little tough this year and uh sales were down quite a bit like 50
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:56.780]   That I think we've managed to keep the shows going but we want to give people a chance to support us to keep the shows going
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:01.260]   And give you some benefit too and that's going to be club twit at twit.tv/club
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:05.020]   Twit there's three benefits. I had free versions of all of our shows
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:09.180]   So if you don't want to hear the ads, although I know a lot of people do so there's actually a section
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:11.660]   On the club twit discord with the ads
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:16.620]   For people who miss them, but you can get all your shows ad free audio and video
[01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:21.100]   There is a discord which is a lot of fun. We set up a stage in the discord
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:25.740]   We're taking questions in the discord where it's a great place to visit to chat
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:28.300]   um, uh
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:32.780]   Um, and uh, I'm just
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:37.340]   You're being distracted by the great stuff of the discord actually
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:42.220]   Yeah, uh, we have a we put up a stage we do take questions in some of the shows which is a lot of fun
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:47.740]   So if you want that's another benefit actually turns out to be a bigger benefit than I thought I you know, we kind of threw that in
[01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:54.780]   Uh, but it's a lot of fun there in their fact. There's uh, there's uh conversations in the discord about other things like comics and uh
[01:53:54.780 --> 01:54:00.300]   anime and data science and hacking and hardware and yes, the twit cruise has its own
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:06.220]   Section in there and then the final piece of the puzzle. There's three different benefits is the twit plus feed
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:11.820]   Which includes stuff that just doesn't make it to the podcast often some of the best stuff happens before or after the shows
[01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:17.820]   Um, uh, there's all sorts of things in there. So you get all three seven bucks a month. That's it
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:21.180]   There's no yearly. There's it's just month to month canceling time
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:24.780]   We didn't want to sign up people for a year and then have them say oh, I don't like it
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:31.660]   So just seven bucks a month and uh, it's uh, I think it's worth it. I really do I really appreciate the support
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:37.180]   Uh, if you go to club, let's see it's this one's twit.tv slash club twit
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:39.820]   Twit.tv slash club twit
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:44.780]   Uh chicken head 21 says can we get the ads without the show and you absolutely can
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:48.300]   There is a whole section that's just the ads
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:52.700]   Just the ads and then people talk about the ads. So that's good
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:57.820]   All the ads all the time you can you can literally listen to a version
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:01.260]   With just the ads if you want
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:06.780]   Actually, I think for the audible ads that probably is a premium feature. You want the audible ads. We're going to charge you
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:09.260]   Uh, thank you everybody for your support
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:12.700]   Now it's time for the picks of the week. We'll start with you andi and not co
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:17.900]   Uh, they're um, Amtrak has just made an offer that they haven't made in a number of years
[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:21.260]   And it's for some people it's going to be very very exciting for some people
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:24.780]   It's not going to be exciting at all, but i'm i'm here to speak to the first group
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:32.540]   They're they're coming back to the they're redoing the usa rail pass. Oh good. This is a pass where for 300 dollars
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:35.420]   Of you have the for 300 dollars
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:44.220]   You can spend 30 days making as many as 10 different stops anywhere on the amtrac network
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:49.260]   You for the it's normally 500 bucks if you go if you buy it before next week
[01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:51.500]   I think the 20th the price is down to 300
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:55.740]   You have 120 days to make your first trip
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:59.740]   And then after you make your first you have 30 days to use all 10 of your segments
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:01.980]   So that means that from any any
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:06.300]   And each segment on the map consists of wherever you get off
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:11.740]   Wherever you get off or have to get off the the train because of a connection that consists of one segment
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:16.620]   So that could mean this is this is this is the sort of thing that like gets me kind of inspired
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.700]   Because as soon as I thought about that i'm like
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:23.500]   Oh, I could do the andi and not go pan eastern seaboard good will tour
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:27.980]   Because like boston to new york that would be one new york to philadelphia would be two
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:33.180]   Philadelphia to washington would be three north of engina would be four
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:37.340]   I'd have to make the stop at northwood because that's where you cha that's where you have to change trains
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:40.780]   To go all the way direct to orlando so maybe go to disney world
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:44.540]   So that's five and then I could make my way back up stopping at different
[01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:49.100]   towns like on the way up and then I then I was looking at the rest of the map thing
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:54.380]   Well, gee you never been to like uh georgery never been to like tennessee and then I thought that oh
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:00.380]   Is there a train stop near dollywood and i'm like what if you just went from like dc to dollywood
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:01.260]   We have
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:03.260]   dollywood sounds like a nice place to be
[01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:06.460]   Uh, and of course you don't have to like do it all in like one trip
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:12.380]   If like I could also do it as like just boston to new york and go make like five different round trips to new york
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:15.020]   And for 300 bucks that would be 30 dollars per
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:20.300]   Per trip which would be at least half to a third to a quarter depending how long you go
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:21.900]   But once again
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:27.660]   Boston all the way to n Norfolk, virginia would be 30 dollars. That's usually like 180 dollar trip
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:33.500]   Uh, so it's very very tempting. I've done. No, I'm a big fan of amtrac as you've heard before
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:35.900]   uh, my usual
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.580]   Endurance is about
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:38.620]   dc
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:41.500]   About eight hours. Uh, although when I was the the last time
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:44.140]   The I did take this off for once
[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:48.220]   Years ago when I had a book out and I decided i'm going to do like an amtrac book tour
[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:52.300]   And I decided to go from boston all the way to chicago 22 hours
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:56.220]   Uh in one go and that's that's a thing man. That's a scene
[01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:58.540]   That's you want to bring a pillow you want to bring a cooler
[01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:01.340]   You want to bring something to put your feet on because this is all in coach
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:05.180]   Uh, so maybe you would need to have a certain adventure to do the 20 hour segments
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:08.220]   But a lot of these are just like three hours four hours five hours
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:12.780]   And it's a chance to I mean there's a to pick like a random stop here
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:17.260]   I might not necessarily want to go to king street, south carolina
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:20.140]   But again, if i'm on my way
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:22.940]   But if i'm on if i'm near if i'm if i'm in dc
[01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:25.260]   Anyway, to see some see some museums
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:28.860]   Maybe I will spend one of my segments to check out because just it's nice to go
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:31.660]   It's nice to go to dc to know that ham i really want to go to
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:36.700]   Uh, the uh, federal arca the us archives because I want to there's some things I want to research there
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:38.540]   But also gee if i'm in dc
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:43.420]   I'm only like two hours away from this other place i've never been to and now it only cost me like 30 bucks
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:47.340]   You don't have to plant and the great thing is you don't have to plan out your route and advance either
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:50.700]   It's just simply it's like it's like hopping the rails. It's like being a hobo
[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:52.940]   You just simply decide that okay
[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:57.660]   It's i'm within my through after you've done your first one now. I'm within my 30-day window
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:03.820]   I just simply open up the amp track app decide okay take me from where i am now to this other place and boom
[01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:06.540]   Your ticket is paid for because it's one of your 10 segments
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:07.660]   So
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:11.500]   I think that after the last year a lot of us are kind of interested in this
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:15.340]   I just want to be anywhere other than within the two mile radius of my house
[01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:20.060]   I've been I was for 14 months straight and for a lot of people myself included
[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:25.100]   This is very very enticing once again if you get I think that the uh the discount
[01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:27.740]   Is up like on
[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:30.860]   I got the the press release in front of me the discount is up on the
[01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:33.420]   22nd
[01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:38.140]   Sorry the 22nd so that's next week if you don't get it then then it goes up to 500 bucks
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:40.700]   Which is still a pretty good deal if you're gonna if you're gonna use it
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:47.260]   Thothfully and tactically, but yeah, that's you take the train all the time right to uh, DC
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:53.100]   New York to I've I've my rule is I don't fly anywhere closer than DC because
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:55.580]   especially to New York because
[01:59:55.580 --> 02:00:02.060]   uh the thing is you I get I get on the tr- I take like a 20 minute uber to a local train station
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:08.700]   I I walk directly from the train from the platform onto the train no security no no checks
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:15.820]   No, you have to check in an hour beforehand. It's you get to spend three hours like on it in a comfortable big like business class seat
[02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:21.020]   With with internet access because your your Wi-Fi hotspot works if you want to drink go to the bar car get a drink
[02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:25.260]   Or set up at a desk at a big table inside the bar car and get work done
[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:29.420]   And then when you get off the train in New York city that drops you off right in the middle of midtown
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:34.220]   And your you feel as though your brain is there at the same time as your body whereas my god
[02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:35.340]   I mean it's 45
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:40.940]   42 43 minutes to fly to New York, but there's like two hours in front of that then two hours after that and all this
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:45.660]   In the airport stuff. I love trains. Um, so
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:48.220]   I
[02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:54.300]   Is it how comfortable are they these days? You said it's like a business class seat very no a coach seats are they're big
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:58.620]   They're big coach class seats. They're also very rarely now the excelis trains
[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:01.180]   Look the the business class and the really high speed trains
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:06.140]   They tend to book up. Yeah, but the they're enough they put enough cars on to the coach section that
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:09.900]   Rarely am I do I have the seat next to it's a there?
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:15.020]   There's two seats by two seats very rarely is the seat next to me occupied and not only that
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:21.100]   But there's also a power outlet like at your like a regular nice like 110 volt power outlet at your seat
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.500]   So it's not even a chance. It's not even a case of oh well
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:27.900]   I can get 12 volts and maybe charge my phone it's like no if you can you can bring a microwave oven on board
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:32.060]   And you can if you want to bring a big hot pocket and
[02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:34.940]   You could do that you could if you had to
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:37.820]   Theoretically i'm putting this in play. I'm saying that theoretically
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:41.580]   I'm saying that it is the nicest time and all the other thing about Amtrak
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:45.500]   I'm sorry. This is going on to a rant because you heard a topic that I really like I love Amtrak
[02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:48.300]   And I loved we took the train a second. Yeah, it was so much fun
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:52.220]   It's great, but there have been so I guess they had the cars getting a little rundown now
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:56.540]   They're they're a little old, but they don't they're not scummy. They're not terrible to be in
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:02:01.180]   But but there the other thing that I always like to mention is that there have been when I'm in New York
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:04.620]   Sometimes I I think that I've I have enough
[02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:09.980]   I can on three hours of sleep that I can stay in New York until like midnight or 2 a.m
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:11.260]   And take the red i-home
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:15.260]   But I decide that at 5 p.m. That no, I don't want it. I can't stay awake that late
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:20.140]   And so I'll and so you just simply go go to the Amtrak app and say are there seats available?
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:23.180]   Okay, there's seats available on the 745 train home
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:27.180]   It will they will give you if there's no there's no charge for for rebooking
[02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:30.140]   They will give you full credit for whatever you paid for your first ticket
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:34.140]   But you know if the price if the if the price is higher because you're booking, you know the same day
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:37.100]   You pay the difference, but usually it's like maybe 20 30 40 bucks
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:41.980]   And again, it's such a humane way to do things you go boston to to New York
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:43.980]   Boston to New York
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:46.940]   Boston to New York routinely also boston to DC
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:50.460]   When I have how long is it to the city from boston
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:58.540]   About three hours three and a half hours the event the excel is a lot as uh as maybe about a half hour 45 minutes faster
[02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:02.220]   The only the only real disadvantage is that sometimes
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:05.180]   particularly if in New York
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:08.300]   Particularly if i'm going from New York back up north
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:12.220]   Delays can definitely happen usually they're on time
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:16.460]   But sometimes you might find yourself waiting 45 minutes to an hour not like you can
[02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:19.900]   Yeah, exactly and the trains are so on time
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:26.940]   And if they apologize if they're a minute late they actually make abject apologies they come in on the no clap
[02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:35.260]   So they did you hear that there was a one of the one of the bullet trains the the leader the director had to apologize because the train left 20 seconds early
[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:36.540]   Yeah
[02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:38.780]   I we we we were in tokyo
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:43.260]   Uh actually I think was we took the bullet train to tokyo from usaka
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:48.940]   Um, we were told now don't tilly dally the doors will open you will have two minutes to get on
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:54.140]   And that's it so don't dilly dally hop on and get on and get on because they're leaving
[02:03:54.140 --> 02:04:00.620]   They keep to a schedule say we'll do if you use your phone all the sort of oh it's wonderful
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:04.300]   I love the tri I would love to see us with train travel maker
[02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:07.020]   Resurgence here in the states. It's just a great way to go
[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:10.860]   I would love my dream is always it has always been to across the country in a roomette
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:15.500]   But that's that's that's my cut off point because it's like uh, but every time I think about doing it
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:20.860]   It's like, uh, but then for the amount of money I would spend on the experts for the roomette
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:22.540]   I could fly to
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:26.460]   Los angeles from san francisco and have the extra money for next to a couple of nights hotel
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:31.180]   And have that the same so yeah, we took when I was a kid in 1971 when we moved to california
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:33.580]   We took a roomette from chicago to oakland
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:37.900]   And it was it's a wonderful memory in fact so much so that leece and i
[02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:41.980]   Is pretty soon. I don't know when it would be next year the year after we're going to do the
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:46.140]   Canadian has the vioreal has a luxury cross-canada
[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:52.700]   uh train trip that I it's also expensive it's like a cruise but you stop in all these great places and
[02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:59.100]   It's I mean, that's that's that's the nice thing especially again with this real past because it goes through cities that are not like right
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:01.580]   They're not like the top 10 tourist destinations
[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:05.580]   But the thing is for the past 150 years they have been a major train stop
[02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:10.940]   So there are things right in that neighborhood right in that district and so it's in the same trip
[02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:13.340]   Yes, I can go to dc and see all those great museums
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:19.180]   But I can also stop at a small town go to a small diner come back on the train like three hours later
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:24.700]   Uh, and then have some really great pictures and some experiences that I would never have been able to plan beforehand
[02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:29.900]   Renee if we did a if we did a twit trains canada train trip would you come on it with us and
[02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:36.140]   I can't promise that i'd be on it with you because vernaid doesn't do well in confined spaces. Oh
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:45.100]   I'm a house animal house pet but uh, virile is amazing and the places it stops are so quintessentially in beautifully Canadian
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:49.900]   Well, I know people who've done short segments of it like across going from vancouver to
[02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:55.020]   Uh, Calgary through bamf, you know, there's just some amazing it is that's the rocky mountain here
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:57.820]   And that that by the way that is it is a dream of mine to do this
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:06:03.180]   Uh, and I'm and we will at some point. I'm just can't wait. I don't think go to maltryol on amp track
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:07.420]   You cannot you can that you can that's that's the end of the that's the end of the m track service
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:08.300]   Yeah, well
[02:06:08.300 --> 02:06:13.100]   I just can't do it all the time because my sister lived in New York and went to john jay college, uh to do her
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:18.940]   Um, not bachelor master's degree and so I would take that every few weeks and it was a nine-hour milk run
[02:06:18.940 --> 02:06:25.820]   Every time with an abundant amount of time at customs because sir take going through a train is it's something when you're at customs. Oh
[02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:32.540]   Papers papers, please don't don't bring your collection of furs because
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.100]   They'll definitely flag that they'll definitely
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:38.700]   And you have to surrender all your use from all your words on the way
[02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:40.860]   Uh
[02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:42.380]   Uh
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:44.380]   Ritchie or pick of the week
[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:52.380]   Lumi see it all right. So these are the beats uh studio, but as they are I don't want to say it's it's a surprise
[02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:57.340]   Uh, you know, not really a surprise because beats have sort of been apples alt account
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:00.780]   You know, like us some of us have an alt account for all our rock bands that we want on instagram
[02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:02.940]   We don't you know to be following them along with all our friends
[02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:09.020]   This is apples alt account where they can experiment with different form factors and different sort of technologies and branding and do mickey
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:13.580]   Mouse licenses that the ghost of steve jobs would never allow on air pods proper
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:21.020]   So this is particularly interesting because they are 149 so cheaper than the air pods too, you know
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:25.660]   Like that would return to 159 much cheaper than the 249 air pods pro
[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:28.300]   And they have some of the same capabilities
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:31.820]   Most you know for some people this will be a huge advantage. There is no
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:37.260]   Absolutely no stem on them. You just have this beats button and it's a clicky. It's not a capacitive button
[02:07:37.260 --> 02:07:39.100]   It is a real clicky button
[02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:45.660]   And you have different nibs and these fit in my poor mangle jiu jitsu judo mangled ear is better than any headset
[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:48.380]   I have ever worn wired or wireless
[02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:54.060]   The the right ear actually stays in like these air pods. I'm keeping a i'm adjusting all the time during the show
[02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:55.660]   Um
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:58.620]   These just stay in I would do all sorts of outside activity at fitness plus
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:02.220]   The fit is wonderful. What you get is
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:05.500]   Active noise cancellation now
[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:10.140]   Some people say it's better than air pods and people say it's worse better than sony worse
[02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:13.180]   The thing with active noise cancellation is it's not an absolute
[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:15.980]   It depends on the environment. Some are really good at
[02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:19.820]   Continual sounds like engine buzz not good at random sounds
[02:08:19.820 --> 02:08:22.940]   The algorithms are really differently tuned by different companies
[02:08:22.940 --> 02:08:26.460]   Some of them are more conservative because they don't want to block out important sounds
[02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:31.260]   Some of them are more aggressive and then you might miss things that you actually want to hear in like in your music
[02:08:31.260 --> 02:08:34.460]   So that varies a lot, but also your your own hearing
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:37.420]   Is it is different than everybody else's hearing?
[02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:40.140]   So when I see people say it's better or worse than that to me it
[02:08:40.140 --> 02:08:42.380]   It means like you don't understand the technology of ANC
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:45.020]   You've got to try them and for you that might absolutely be true
[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:48.620]   Someone else might like i'm a lot better as long as we're talking about the same class
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:53.660]   Of devices. So I like these a little bit better than air pods when it comes to active noise cancelling
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:56.300]   It just seems to suit my environment a little bit better
[02:08:56.300 --> 02:09:03.420]   There are some downside and it does the transparency mode too, which boosts sounds. Yeah, that's a nice future on the air pods max
[02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:10.940]   Yeah, yeah, because that way like they're not blocking off the sound you don't get apples h1 w1 or h1 chip set
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:16.300]   This has a custom chip set that's designed to optimize for both ios and for android
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:21.980]   So it does the auto pairing the same way as air pods on ios does the android you tap it to the screen
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:26.860]   And it pairs both pods separately so in case you want to only listen with one or the other you can do that
[02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:33.100]   And it uses android's built-in framework to do that works really well, but it doesn't do the automatic
[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:36.780]   Propagation of that pairing to all your apple devices
[02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:41.020]   And for some people that will be a curse because they love to set it up once and use it everywhere
[02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:45.820]   For other people who think that it's just so darn promiscuous that when your air pods max are across the room
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:49.500]   Just don't take it over you know from the headset you're wearing now could be a blessing
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:51.820]   You've got to figure that out for you
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:56.620]   There is no capacitive charging no capacitive charging case, but it uses usb c instead of lightning
[02:09:56.620 --> 02:10:02.140]   So if you're if you're just an iphone user that might irk you because you have an abundance of of lightning cables
[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:05.020]   But if you're are a like a macbook and ipad
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:10.940]   Nintendo switch and android user, you know if you're a pc user you're still on usb a so i feel for you
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:14.220]   But you know for most modern technologies you'll have us bc cables
[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:22.060]   And they have like beats sound the way that i understand apple's lab works is they they move everything to scientific
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:27.660]   Like absolute and then they have a bunch of humans tune it because scientific sound is not really good for anybody
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:31.980]   And there's like just different humans tuning them so you get it's not the old beats, you know
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:33.500]   boom boom
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:40.060]   Basie sound but to me it sounds a little bit different than air pods so they've they've still got their own unique characteristic
[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:44.940]   And they're so inexpensive that and they fit so well that if i had to choose right now
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:48.620]   Even though i like there's also no head tracking for spatial audio because there's no sensors
[02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:54.140]   And some people care about that some people don't i but like i said in my review blasters in my head
[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:59.020]   I would choose these now because even though they're missing features the ones that they have are the most important ones for me
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:09.100]   I I knew because i haven't used those but uh, I thought that uh noise cancellation in the uh airpods pro max the over the ear headphones was superb
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:14.860]   That's that's different. That's probably best in class from yeah, it's different because of course you're sealing off off your ear that way
[02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:21.020]   And it's a little hard to do that with buds, but um boy I was that I should to be fair
[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:26.300]   I did slam them for their uh audio quality, but they I can't wait to wear them on the airplane
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:28.700]   It's the best noise cancellation i've ever used so
[02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:34.380]   They're blue tooth so you're always going to be limited by what yeah audio can be put through a bluetooth pipe and that's never going to be great
[02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:39.020]   No, it's a little disappointing, but that's life. I was you know, it's a shame the wired
[02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:41.420]   the 35 dollar
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:45.180]   Not included wired doesn't give you actual wired sound but
[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:51.100]   You but the $10 part will like if you get apples $10 adapter then plug in your own cord. Uh, you'll get it
[02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:53.580]   You're kidding. Wait a minute. Tell me that again. That's got a
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:57.580]   Yeah, so apple since they deleted the headphone jack apple made this little $10
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:00.460]   uh 3.5 millimeter to um
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:07.020]   lightning adapter and that um that that's got a DAC in it a pretty good DAC for for a $10 part
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:10.380]   Oh
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:16.700]   It's lightning on both ends because that's the weird thing about no, it's it's the opposite of the core that they made
[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:22.300]   Oh, okay, it's a cord like it's meant to plug lightning headphones into 3.5 millimeter jacks. Oh, that's weird
[02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:29.340]   So I have lightning headphones or so I guess so then it will be wired headphones
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:34.300]   Yeah, I don't know if it'll work for the AirPods max. I haven't tried that but uh, you know
[02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:39.420]   That's what I thought you do have lightning headphones and you want to get all this like you you want to get all these features
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:44.780]   I can I mean it will I haven't just tested it yet. I'm gonna or I mean that's those are cheap
[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:48.540]   I think I'll order that and but these are really for people who value convenience over a quality
[02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:53.260]   Yeah, I reason to go truly wireless. I'd like both please if you don't mind. Yes
[02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:59.580]   I know we won't someday someday we will but uh, maybe when there's a new bluetooth codec
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:01.740]   There are new newer codecs than aptX
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:06.300]   That supposedly sound better bluetooth five supposedly sounds better. We shall we shall see
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:09.420]   Would have been nice to have that headphone jack
[02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:13.100]   Then I'd have a choice
[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:19.100]   Mr. Renee ritchie. Thank you so much Renee ritchie calm. No, uh youtube.com/Renee ritchie
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:21.260]   right
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:24.300]   Yes, what are what are you you got a new thing you're doing?
[02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:30.380]   It's the new Renee ritchie. He's changed his oh changed his tone
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:34.620]   Yeah, well, I I went through a real I don't want to bore one of the details
[02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:38.540]   I went through like in my personal life a really really hard week last week right in the middle of wdc
[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:42.860]   And it caused me to reevaluate just how I was doing things why I was doing things
[02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:49.020]   I was going for a really I spent a month working on like packaging my content for youtube and what would get high retention and
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:51.420]   you know would be like
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:53.580]   More clickable and I just I got so based
[02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:57.660]   Because I didn't sleep because dub dub and because I was going through all these issues
[02:13:57.660 --> 02:14:03.580]   That I just and then there was just such like I get triggered when there's reporting that I feel like is being opportunistically
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:05.340]   um
[02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:09.260]   What's the right when it's taking advantage of a reader rather than trying to educate them being exploitive?
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:15.180]   Oh god. Yes, rather than trying to like you have an opportunity when something happens and apple doesn't explain or google doesn't explain
[02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:19.740]   Your choice is I can use that to clickbait and exploit my audience for those clicks
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:25.180]   Or I can educate like I can do the work the research figure it out and explain it to you so that you you might love it
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:28.060]   You might hate it, but at least you're doing it smart. That's what you do
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:32.460]   That's that's what I really tried to do, but I was I don't say I was getting away from it
[02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:38.060]   But I was putting I think too much pressure on myself to tightly package things in so now I'm just turning on the camera
[02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:41.420]   I'm not worrying about scripts and not worrying about editing very much. I'm just recording
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:45.420]   um, and I call it based on a just because like I feel like I like
[02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:52.940]   My audience connection is more important to me than any imaginary youtube growth factors should be
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:56.700]   Good job. You came to the right decision
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:02.860]   Why do you think my shows are so crappy because I don't care about optimizing
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:06.780]   Or engagement. I just turn on the mic and we have fun
[02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:09.820]   We talk with people we like about things. Do you think I love that?
[02:15:09.820 --> 02:15:15.420]   We try to tell the truth we try to find the actual truth if we don't know it. I think that's exactly right
[02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:21.660]   Well done. Yeah, I was getting in a trap where I was like looking at some other channels that were growing really really fast that they were doing things like
[02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:24.540]   They were announcing they were every video was
[02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:30.780]   Price and date for apple announcing products that don't exist right or right, you know, here's apples and fur apples
[02:15:30.780 --> 02:15:35.420]   August event leaked which doesn't exist right and they were just getting hundreds of thousands of views and I was like
[02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:39.260]   I can't compete with that but at least I can I'm like I didn't care anymore. You shouldn't compete with it
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:43.420]   No, you should not try to compete with it. Um, I've had to come to grips with that as well
[02:15:43.420 --> 02:15:44.860]   I mean everything
[02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:49.020]   You know, uh, you see that happen all the time. It's been happening as long as I've been a broadcaster
[02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:54.780]   And uh at some point you just have to say, you know, I have a higher goal in life
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:57.020]   Good good job
[02:15:57.020 --> 02:15:59.660]   And you do great stuff. So keep it up youtube.com
[02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:02.460]   I have a special interview coming tomorrow. Just a little little
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:07.900]   A good interview if I finish editing it in time. I should have a really good interview for everybody tomorrow
[02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:10.220]   It's actually I believe a hazard of
[02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:12.940]   Uh having the apple beat
[02:16:12.940 --> 02:16:15.980]   It's a very challenging beat and there's a lot of
[02:16:15.980 --> 02:16:19.580]   Competition and uh, it's a it's a hazard of that beat
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:23.580]   And so I commend you for uh for doing the right thing. That's good
[02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:28.380]   Don't court the lemmings as punter. It's why I stopped doing rumors, you know, seven
[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:31.820]   It takes me a while I stopped doing rumors because they were too stressful seven for a long time
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:37.420]   I I said we'll never do rumors on these shows, but then there's so many weeks without anything but rumors
[02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:38.700]   We have to
[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:42.860]   I want to cover them, but I don't break them anymore. Exactly. I don't want to be involved in the breaking of rumors
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:45.100]   But I'll cover them to tell people if they're reasonable or not
[02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:48.540]   That's what we do. I think that's what that's the right thing to do because people hear the rumors
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:52.700]   We got to tell them whether it's worth listening to and also they want to make decisions on like should they buy this computer now?
[02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:57.500]   Or should they wait if you give them good quality information, you know, that's a makeup decision
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:16:59.580]   That's important to them for their money
[02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:01.500]   Hang in there my friend
[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:05.500]   If you need me to come up to Montreal and buy you some smoked meat and bagels, I'll be there
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:11.980]   If I can let me in I don't know if they'll let me in anytime not yet, but when you're by time your train goes, it'll absolutely
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:15.900]   We're definitely stopping in montry off when we do the train. That's for sure
[02:17:15.900 --> 02:17:17.740]   Thank you rene
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:19.020]   Andy and aco
