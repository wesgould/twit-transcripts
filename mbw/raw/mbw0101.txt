[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.200]   And while Colleen and Tony take all my gear down at 101,
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.920]   I'm going to try to do this with a bare bone.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.360]   Just kind of like the old days of podcasting
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.160]   that I had a microphone and a man and two great co-hosts.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.840]   Mr. Merlin, man, from the 43 folders,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   and you look nice today at take.com.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.760]   Hello, Merlin.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.600]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.440]   How are you doing today?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.440]   Very well.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.280]   How's the shield?
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.840]   The coat of arms going?
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.360]   Pretty good?
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.120]   Oh, it's going great.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.640]   Right now, mine is a sandwich rampant
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.400]   on a field of other sandwiches.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160]   Not even a bed of greens, just sandwiches.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.280]   I never said it was going to be good, Leo.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.600]   I said it's something I'm working on.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.520]   It's a process, and I'm spending time with that.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.080]   It's sandwiches all the way down.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.320]   It's the only you get that, Merlin.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.960]   I have to say, having listened to you look nice today now,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.880]   I realize what an intelligent person you are.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.360]   You're brilliant.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.200]   Every time they start talking about something,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.000]   you say, oh, yeah, rampant.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.480]   Well, that means it's standing on its back legs.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.680]   I like pie.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.520]   You say, oh, you're so good.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.560]   I say, oh, yes.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.080]   That's-- when the two letters are joined together,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   oh, yeah, that's a ligature.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.760]   Yeah, that's a little bit.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.000]   Well, you know what it is.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.680]   I have fluoride in the water in Ohio and Wikipedia.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.880]   OK, I want you to tell me the truth.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.160]   Do they edit out the pause while you search on Wikipedia
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.480]   and then come up with the answer?
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.960]   A lot of the editing this up.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.840]   Oh, see, it's making you sound very smart.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.160]   Rather, rather, I know, in fact, that it's called a ligature.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.920]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is here from a hotel somewhere
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.360]   in the Southern Californian region.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.680]   I am in the Kyoto Grand Hotel.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.600]   Ooh, that's in Japan.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.240]   No, actually, I'm actually in LA.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.400]   Oh, they fooled you.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.920]   Yeah, they did.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.200]   I thought I was going to be in Tokyo.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.120]   I got out of the cabin.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.000]   It turned out I was in some really skanky part of LA.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.840]   But I'm down here for Sea Graph, which
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.120]   is the big graphics conference.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.800]   Special interest groups, graphics.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.440]   It's part of the Arctic ACM.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.000]   But it's now taken on a life of its own.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.440]   It's kind of on a life of its own.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.040]   And 15, 20,000 people come and chat about computer graphics.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.240]   You get to see all the-- you know,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.520]   how they put together lots of behind the scenes for movies.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.760]   And there's parties here.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.440]   We had vanilla ice at a party last night.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.880]   Vanilla ice.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.640]   They did.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.360]   Would he help you out for the food or something?
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.720]   Was he missing?
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.360]   He was singing.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.360]   He was singing.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.760]   He had a band.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   Well, that's right.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.960]   He does that kind of like new metal now, right?
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.200]   He does that kind of like that rappy angry music.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.280]   That's his deal now.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.520]   But he still did do ice ice baby, which was very important,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   given that the party's better.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   They're probably like holding the check under like a bell jar
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.680]   going like, you know what, Johnny?
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.120]   Get up there and sing the damn song if you want the stupid check.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.120]   That's very interesting.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.280]   We're very interested in your project and your new blog.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.640]   I'll tell you what, once you get up there and do the fricking song.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   So anyway, having fun, checking out lots of good stuff.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.880]   Much respect.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.840]   By the way, much respect to Mr. Ice.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   Respect.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   I apologize.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.080]   There's no tea in respect.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.200]   There's no eye and team and there's no tea in respect.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.600]   Sorry.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.040]   Respect.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.800]   But we recorded, by the way, we recorded the first twin tech.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.120]   So we've had twin and we were splitting out a new show.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.320]   Oh, people have been asking about that.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   And how about, aren't you doing a developer thing from--
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.400]   Yeah, so Mac Break Dev should launch this week.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.920]   It should actually start today.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.760]   Today?
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.960]   It should go out today or tomorrow.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.400]   Mac Break Dev, which is actually a couple of them
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.640]   have been in the Mac Break feed.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.600]   We started Mac Break Studio last week, which is all Pro Apps.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   And then Mac Break Dev is going to come out.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.120]   And it's just going to be about the most pedestrian Mac
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.000]   Break Dev is going to get is like Automator.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.040]   So we're going to get Sal to come in and talk about Automator.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.280]   But it's Automator than Apple Script, Xcode.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.960]   We have an awesome one that we showed earlier from Mac Break Dev
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.080]   that is on turning your Wii into a 3D controller
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.320]   for a quartz composer.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.160]   So it's really super geeky stuff.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.600]   Yeah, and so--
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.760]   I would love to see you do one on Lua, which
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.640]   is the application programming language.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.480]   And VoodooPad uses Lua.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.040]   And I don't know where more apps will start using Lua as a way.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.240]   It's a really neat idea, although Mac had really--
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.880]   So someone asked me that.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.120]   Now it makes more sense.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.640]   I have to admit, we will do one on Lua.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.840]   Someone asked me-- I was talking about writing some new stuff
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.920]   that we're putting together some new tools right now
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.560]   internally.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.000]   And they said, are you going to do it with Lua?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.720]   And I was like, I kind of gave him a blank look.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.480]   Who's that?
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.640]   I don't know if I'm going to use her.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.960]   And then there's--
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.600]   Acorn uses Python.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.840]   I think it's really interesting to see
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.960]   how scriptable Mac applications are becoming.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.640]   They've always been kind of some Apple Script.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.080]   But I love it when applications--
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.200]   that started with Emacs, I guess, where you could use Lisp
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.360]   to write extensions.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.280]   I love it when applications do that.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.000]   Well, and I think that what we really noticed
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.480]   was how accessible a lot of these developer tools are.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.960]   I mean, Xcode comes with the Mac for free.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.280]   And Python and Ruby and Perl.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.520]   I don't know if Perl works.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.200]   But all of these other languages.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.960]   So the idea is, let's figure out a way
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.440]   to start doing a show that lets people both see some of the just
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.160]   the geekier side of things that are cool, but also
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.040]   learn how to get started.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.440]   So we're going to do literally like, here's
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.240]   how to write your first Xcode kind of stuff.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.880]   So how to write your first--
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.200]   What is that launch?
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.160]   This week today, maybe.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.320]   Because I'm launching something.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.520]   I know a lot of people have been watching this week in me.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.120]   And I have a new thing from this week in me,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.920]   Dev.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.080]   And it's going to be all the ways you can access me by APIs
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.240]   and different kinds of calls.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.640]   And we'll be releasing some open source code that'll let
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.600]   people use me in different places.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   And there's a lot of DRM.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.440]   So don't get too happy.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.280]   But me has--
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.520]   I hear he has an API.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.280]   I think that's good.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.680]   I think that's really important.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.080]   Me has an API.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.360]   By the way, I just want to ask, are we talking to the real
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   Merlin or the nice Merlin today?
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.200]   Nice Merlin or fake Merlin, man.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.480]   I think it's like a lot of people started making fun of me
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.000]   online.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.320]   It's not funny.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.160]   And it's not cool.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.880]   Although nice Merlin does, nice Merlin, apparently,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.600]   just helped somebody pee on his car, which I thought was kind
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.120]   of sweet.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.920]   Follow nice Merlin on Twitter.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.520]   N-I-C-E-M-E-R-L-I-N.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.600]   Follow him on Twitter.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.120]   It'll bring a smile to your day.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.880]   You kind of look a little bit like the Joker in the picture,
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.720]   but that's OK.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.080]   Before we go on, I just want to mention
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.480]   we're going to get to another story in a second.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.080]   But this episode of Mac Break Weekly
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.680]   is brought to you by a new sponsor for us, Go To Meeting.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.400]   You know why they're new?
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.280]   Because they now have a Mac client.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.720]   Oh, that's so cool.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.400]   Which makes it make sense for Mac Break.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.120]   Do you use-- yeah, thank you.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.080]   Do you use Go To Meeting ever?
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.520]   I have not, but it's something that we know we need that.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.560]   You could probably use that.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.840]   So if you go to go to meeting.com/MacBreak
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   as a free 30-day trial, the ID is online meetings.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.200]   And they've had this for Windows for some time.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.080]   So you schedule a meeting in advance or on the fly.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.520]   It's very-- just click at the mouse.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.600]   What happens is your clients or your colleagues
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.840]   or you could be other members of the Pixel Core--
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.120]   perfect for a Pixel Core meeting.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.800]   All they have to do is they don't have to install a software
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.280]   or anything.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.680]   They just go to go to meeting.com and put in the meeting ID.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.560]   And then they're seeing your screen.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.560]   You know, I've done lectures.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.240]   You could even do lectures with hundreds of people
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.720]   with this stuff, where you show people how stuff--
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.840]   great for training.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.080]   Let's say you've got a new application
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.360]   and you want people to try the application, Alex.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.600]   They could-- you don't even have to install the application.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.440]   They don't have to install it.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.160]   You have it.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.000]   You're using it.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.160]   You say, OK, now you try it.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.200]   They could take control.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.080]   Use the application and your machine remotely.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.560]   Right.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.520]   Awesome stuff.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.680]   Well, and that's what we just did this--
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.400]   we did an event here at Seagrap where we had about 60
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.120]   or 70 people watching these top artists putting together
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.320]   a production shot.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.120]   And we finished it.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.360]   And we were like, you know, we had 60 people.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.200]   We could have had 6,000 watching it directly, you know?
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.800]   And that's the thing we're looking at next.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.200]   I don't know if they could do 6,000.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.720]   You should check with it.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.360]   No, no, no.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.680]   It'd be good for like more handful of classes.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.160]   I'm just--
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.720]   You could do classes for-- you know, the size of classes
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.640]   you do, you could easily do.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.040]   Anyway, I just-- it's now on Mac.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.680]   Check it out.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.080]   Free trial, 30 days.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.560]   Use it on your Mac or your PC.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.520]   See what it looks like for you.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.800]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.480]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.440]   And give it a try.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.760]   We really-- you know, Citrix, who does this,
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.760]   is a sponsor of my radio shows for four years now.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.240]   And I've been a big fan.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.360]   I use their stuff all the time.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.440]   And I'm just thrilled.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.480]   It's been something I've been asking them for a long time.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.400]   I go to meeting Mac and they finally--
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.440]   they said, yeah, Leo, we know.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.200]   We're working on it.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.680]   We're working on it.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.200]   And they finally got it.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.160]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.880]   And I love--
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.320]   What's up with Mac?
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.920]   What's going on with the Mac this week?
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.480]   What do you mean?
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.080]   Oh, the Mac?
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.760]   Oh, Mac!
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.600]   You're right.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.120]   Thank you, Merlin, for bringing us back on track.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.360]   That's what nice Merlin does.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.280]   And he takes it and he turns it.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.360]   And then he brings it back to the Mac.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.240]   Brings it back to the Mac.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.920]   Big fire in Cupertino last night and this morning.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.880]   Three alarm fire.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.280]   Apple burned down.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:43.680]   Well, that's--
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.160]   It's over.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.080]   That's probably going a little far.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.200]   But it was the Apple Research Building, the R&D building,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.640]   where many important things have come out of this--
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.080]   who knows?
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.320]   It's Valley Green 6.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.760]   Hardware research and development projects.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.440]   They might have an excuse now for not shipping a tablet.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.760]   I hope it's not where they keep the eye disc.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.000]   I think the problem was they turned it up to 11 and left it.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.160]   And I think it's actually where mobile me lives.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.360]   And a lot of suspicion they found where they ran.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.600]   Yeah, Steve said anybody got any accelerants
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.880]   because this thing is not going well.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.440]   You got a real nice sync service here.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.640]   The ashamed of something happening.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.760]   Well, the only thing that's scary
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.520]   is that of course a lot of the stuff in that dev area
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.600]   is going to be not stuff that's reproducible somewhere else.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.040]   So if it really has a lot of stuff there,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.160]   it could be very hard to rebuild it.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.720]   You don't think they have our sync at Apple?
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.360]   I think they do.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.480]   But if it's hardware, if it's not software, if it's hardware,
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.240]   there's components there that would be--
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.200]   It's unclear what's in this building, actually.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.960]   According to the Associated Press,
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.640]   a fire burned for three hours, three alarm
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.360]   fired just under control just early this morning.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.120]   They were doing some air conditioning repairs
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.080]   that day in the building.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.400]   They think it started underneath an air conditioner.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.480]   A tweet from an Apple employee-- we're getting our news
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.880]   from Twitter now--
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.680]   says that part of the campus affected was Valley Green 6,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   but that now this is the question.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.680]   VG6 mostly has IT people in it.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.240]   So it's hard-- nobody-- it's not clear, Apple.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.720]   And Apple's not saying what was in there
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.760]   and if anything was damaged.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.720]   But big fire.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.000]   It was on all the local news.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.080]   And by the way, the photo that's on Apple Insider
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.400]   is just really cool.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.720]   You get all the reflections on the firefighters.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.360]   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what's going on there.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.280]   What is that?
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.200]   That's all the reflectors.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.280]   That highly reflective--
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.640]   Oh, it's the back of their slash hit it.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   And so someone took a picture of the flash
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.840]   and it grabbed all that stuff.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.880]   So beyond the fire itself, there's
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.240]   a really cool photo on Apple Insider.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.320]   Even then, it's all about user experience with them.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.280]   We're going to make a fire that's
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.800]   going to produce some beautiful artifacts.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   Exactly.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.000]   They're very focused.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.520]   That's how it looks.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.680]   Let's start this whole fire over.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.000]   I'm going to fire the head of this division
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.560]   and we're going to start a different fire.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.600]   New fire.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.000]   Let's see, what else is new?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.640]   There's quite a bit, actually, of Apple News.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.320]   Best Buy is going to start selling iPhones.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.080]   September 7th.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.440]   I don't know.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.120]   I guess, are they going to still have to do that activation thing?
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.720]   Oh, man.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.280]   My activation thing actually wasn't that bad, except that I
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.320]   think I actually have a--
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.520]   I think I actually got a lemon.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   I thought it was a phone.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.040]   Did you go to 201?
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.560]   You know, we haven't convened since 201.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.960]   201 came out last week.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.600]   I found it to really improve reliability.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.320]   Well, my reliability is mostly--
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.320]   and I do believe I'm on 201, it loses time overnight.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.960]   And it turns out that this is something that it is.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   Yeah, no, so it's really cool.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.720]   When you wake up in the morning and you turn it on,
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.960]   it says it's like two hours behind.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.040]   And then it shakes its head and gets caught up.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.880]   As soon as it gets caught up--
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.160]   Getting high for the network, yeah.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.720]   And so, evidently--
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.160]   Actually, the time that Apple.com time is wrong.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.920]   Yeah, so this is--
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.880]   It's so weird.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.000]   Yeah, let me tell you how many times--
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.520]   because I use my iPhone as an alarm clock.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   And it's not very effective.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.000]   It loses two and a half hours overnight.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.600]   Let me tell you.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.000]   Oh, god, no.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.240]   So now I've stopped doing that.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.000]   And I'm just waiting for enough time.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.360]   Evidently, I twitted it.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.240]   And it turned out that I got a bunch of responses back.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.040]   And what I've been told as part of the Twitter mind
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.760]   has told me that other people have had this problem.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.440]   And there's some kind of connection
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.160]   and a handful of these phones where
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.400]   the SIM card connected to the--
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.240]   there's some kind of bad connection to the phone.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.040]   And for some reason, that's affecting the time.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.040]   Now, here's the other thing, though,
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.720]   is that it seems to also affect the GPS.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.280]   So because the GPS is based on time,
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.000]   I'm finding that I have to restart my iPhone to get GPS.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.280]   So you're saying you're having trouble using GPS
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.120]   and that the time sometimes is getting dropped?
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.560]   Yes.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.800]   Can I just put out there something for you
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.520]   to think about that you might be living on a tear
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.880]   in the space-time continuum?
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.600]   No, actually, one of my computers, my Mac Mini in the office,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.720]   is like 15 minutes off.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.320]   And I leave it that way to kind of 15 minutes ahead.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.120]   And I literally--
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.280]   So I'm already at that.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.280]   I feel like I'm in a time warp every time I walk out
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.400]   of the office because I feel like I--
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.160]   because I relate to that time all the time.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.200]   And I walk out and I've got 15 more minutes.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.320]   And I don't want to give it up because I've got 15 more minutes.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.240]   I get 15 new minutes every time I leave my office.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.840]   It's very exciting.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.160]   I think there's--
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.440]   I think it will be charitable to say there's still some work
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.440]   to do.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.160]   I think seriously, I think there is some stuff that is still like--
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.080]   I'm pretty darn happy.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.440]   Try to take a photo lately.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.960]   Well, yes, I take it all the time.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.800]   I just took one of--
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.320]   I take a photo, though, and it takes about--
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.440]   I'm going to say six seconds for the show.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.480]   It's slow, yeah.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.680]   And then-- and then I get this Mondrian thing where
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.560]   it's broken into four different pictures.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.640]   And it's all--
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.640]   Have you seen this yet?
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:44.640]   No.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.640]   Have you seen this bug?
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.280]   I get it.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:46.720]   I get it.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.560]   Yeah, it really gets--
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.440]   Do you have the delay with the SMS?
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.520]   Like, anytime you want to use the first time you use the keyboard,
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.840]   you hit it, and you hit the first key, and then you just like--
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.440]   You guys got to do a hard restore.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.720]   I'm not kidding you.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.240]   OK.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:58.640]   Oh, really?
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.960]   So you're saying, like, back it up, wipe it, start up.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.640]   Don't back it up, because that's not--
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.560]   you'll restore the hard--
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.560]   the stuff that you're getting rid of.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.040]   Oh, see, I see.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.680]   What you want to do is a hard restore.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.720]   So you press and hold--
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.200]   You can--
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.920]   It's all the way down.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.640]   --all the way down.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.640]   You connect it to your iTunes.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.320]   Then you hold the top button and the two buttons.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.600]   You hold them for a long time until the phone itself shows you
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.440]   an icon of a plug going into iTunes.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.880]   And then you go to iTunes and you say restore.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.560]   And it's going to say, you want me to restore from backup?
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.480]   You're saying, no, because you're just
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.240]   going to restore your problems.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.360]   It will download the latest firmware.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.280]   I've done this three times.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.360]   The third time was the charm.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.040]   And I'm sort of gotten-- the delays are gone.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.320]   The crashes are gone.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.040]   Now, one of the problems I was having pre-201 was installing apps--
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.440]   and I said this last time--
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.160]   installing apps from the air over the air
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.800]   or doing updates over the air is problematic,
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.960]   because they get partial updates.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.760]   I haven't had that problem since 2001.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.640]   As an experiment, I started installing stuff.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.560]   But that may just be that I didn't--
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.440]   nothing bad happened.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.280]   So I would stay away from that, too.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   But honest to God, I think doing the restore gives you--
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.160]   I'm going to do the fresh start.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   It's like formatting the drive.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.760]   Yeah, because it's--
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.680]   I mean, I love it.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.920]   I mean, I love having my GBS.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.840]   I love the new phone.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.440]   I love doing my Twitter--
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.480]   Twitterific or whatever on it and everything else.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   But I have to admit that it's about a quarter of the stability
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.240]   of my 1.0.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.720]   I don't know if it's 201 or the restores I've done.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.600]   We're not installing from over the air.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.400]   But one of those three things, or maybe a combination--
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:30.920]   It's all done.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.240]   OK.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.720]   --have made this phone not only very robust--
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.000]   I have four or five pages of application.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.200]   I have 40 or 50 apps on here.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   I keep downloading and installing new ones.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.800]   And I am just super happy.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.040]   I have to say the quality of the apps--
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.360]   I know I'm running counter the common wisdom.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.240]   But I'm thinking there's some very good apps on here.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.920]   I bought this app.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.000]   It was $1,000.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.600]   But boy, is it great.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.480]   Have you seen this?
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.040]   I know what I did.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.640]   It's really nice.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.240]   I bought that app.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.280]   I bought eight copies.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.400]   And I was mad that there wasn't a way to kind of loosen
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.640]   together.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.360]   Did you buy that, Alex?
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:02.880]   Which one?
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.080]   I am rich.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.560]   I'm rich.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.080]   No.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:05.680]   I have not bought one.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.320]   I think it was Merlin and me who bought all the copies,
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.080]   actually, now that I--
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.320]   He claims to sell--
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.400]   I mean, he claimed to sell seven copies.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:11.880]   Is that true?
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.480]   He claims to sell eight.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.440]   Although two people say they did it by mistake.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.880]   Now let me ask you, how do you buy $1,000 application,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.000]   my mistake?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.400]   Beer.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.800]   Too much I beer.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.760]   Yeah, well, it is just one touch.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.880]   You sit there and go, and then it downloads, and you've got it.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:33.000]   And I have to admit, I can see why Apple was particular, at least,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.560]   or try to be particular about some of these apps.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.000]   At the beginning, I downloaded two bad ones, the iTrans Bart
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.680]   and the FSF subways.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.040]   Yeah, I haven't looked at those.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.840]   I'm expecting them to be something that I could actually
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.880]   check the schedule for Bart, which I was willing to pay for.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:51.020]   And I paid $21 for both of them together, like $7 for $1,
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.400]   and $14, the other, whatever.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.040]   And they're just maps.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:54.640]   I mean, they're just like--
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.520]   I'm extremely disappointed at the call.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.720]   I can't believe I paid $14 for a picture.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.440]   Call of the control has got awful.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.720]   Yeah, so that was the only-- so then what happened was--
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.120]   and of course, my reaction was that I stopped buying apps.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.600]   I was just like, I'm just going to wait it out
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:17.560]   and see what people review it and see how it turns up
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.920]   and get some more feedback for a mile.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.120]   Job says they're selling $1 million a day in applications,
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.880]   although according to the stats I've seen
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.040]   was a grouber who published them.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.000]   It looked like almost all the apps were free apps,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.680]   a lot of free apps anyway.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.440]   Well, some of them-- now there's an app that
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.280]   is a controller for Pro Tools that is coming out that is--
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.040]   it's like $150.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.240]   But I think that that is an exciting thing
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.200]   where you're starting to really see Pro solutions using
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.640]   the iPhone that I think we're going to see a lot more of.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.800]   It's just an operating system.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.640]   You're also seeing a lot of Pro solution prices
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.120]   for things that aren't done.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.280]   There's a lot of apps that are basically an interesting idea.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.680]   And really, I think what most people
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.200]   will consider a prototype.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.320]   And it's a shame because I've said this
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.640]   is half a dozen times now, but there's
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.320]   two problems with the App Store that they've
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.880]   got to figure out how to deal with.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.080]   One is the fact that people are going
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.000]   to have a bad experience of the App Store
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.480]   if they don't have any way.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   And you notice, I chose those words carefully.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.960]   I didn't say a bad experience of the app.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.960]   They're going to have a bad experience of the App Store
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.880]   if they feel like there's a large cost
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.000]   associating with figuring out whether something is worth
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.560]   the money.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.400]   So essentially, you can't find out until you bought it.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.160]   I thought Apple was going to vet these things.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.520]   How does a $1,000 app get on there
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.040]   and then get pulled after eight copies?
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.560]   It's bad on both sides.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.000]   It's bad on the one hand because they didn't vet it.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Bad on the other hand because they all
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.120]   they're saying, for any reason, we'll just decide to pull
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.280]   and that was too expensive.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.480]   We're going to pull it.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.040]   I think there's two reasons.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.680]   There's another one that goes hand in hand with that,
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.960]   which is you can't search the iTunes store and preview
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.080]   in the same way that you would with music or a movie.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   I can at least see, oh, is this the version of--
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.520]   I was talking earlier for a podcast, someone else today.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.560]   Is this the version of "Photograph" by Ringo Starr
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.400]   that I think it is?
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.560]   Is this a live version or is this actually a deaf leopard
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.160]   version?
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.640]   And why not?
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.080]   How would you do that with apps?
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.640]   You could.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.480]   There's a developer tool that lets you preview the way
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.640]   that your app's going to work before you.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.080]   That's how everyone was developing stuff.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.640]   They should figure out some way.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.560]   Or maybe it's a separate app where you can download it
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.640]   and play it.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.720]   This is like walking into a video store in 1985.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.520]   They've got a lot of blank boxes.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.320]   And on the front, it says, cool movie where people fight.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.400]   $20.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.520]   And you go, oh, wait a minute.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.400]   Can I get an idea?
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.560]   Can I at least see the cover?
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.480]   And you're like, cool movie.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.120]   Buy it.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.760]   Well, they give you screenshots.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.480]   I think the reviews are useful.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   Do you read the reviews?
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.680]   Oh, the reviews are terrific.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.360]   They're funny.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.960]   They're getting dig-like almost.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.120]   It's like a cup of vomit and three stars.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.000]   The one thing I have noticed is that if you're going to charge
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.400]   a lot for an app, you better look really, really good
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.200]   because people will attack you.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.440]   They don't even download it.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.960]   They're just like, this is too expensive.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.440]   These people don't--
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.880]   like I said, I said, it's on Twitter the other day.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.320]   Most of these people don't have a forebrain, let alone an iPhone.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.280]   They're not using these apps.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.880]   They're just leaving stupid comments to be in jerk.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.080]   It's dig-like.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.560]   Totally.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.000]   They need some moderation there, too.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.640]   But at the same time-- for instance, I went to buy a fellow,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.960]   read the comments and said, don't buy this.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   Get the free Morocco.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.920]   It's better because, for instance, it saves games.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.360]   When you quit the program.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.120]   And I agree.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:14.640]   And it was great.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.160]   And it was free.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.920]   And it saved me $5.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.400]   So sometimes reviews are useful.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:17.760]   It is.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.600]   But here's the problem.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.000]   That's all still a black box.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.320]   And as much as you want to go--
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.480]   OK, so if I go to Amazon and I see a book with 300 reviews on it
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.120]   and it's 4 and 1/2 stars, well, there's
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.480]   something to the weight of that that makes me say, OK,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.640]   a lot of people seem to like this.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.040]   So even if it's not for me, this could still
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:32.720]   be a pretty good book.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.560]   The trouble is this is a completely black box.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   I go in there and there's a bunch of 14-year-old boys
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.360]   leaving one star and going, fail.
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.240]   And then there's something I can pay $20 for.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.640]   And it's like--
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.680]   Well, you've got to read them.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.840]   You've got to read them.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.760]   I mean, even the star system isn't working very well on Amazon.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.240]   What do we know more than anything
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.760]   about Apple products, hardware, and software?
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.960]   We know you've got to hold it in your hand
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.640]   and use it to decide whether it's--
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.520]   so what am I going to do?
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.120]   So go look at to-do list applications.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   There's like 18 to-do list applications.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.040]   They've all got a check mark on the icon.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.920]   And they all say, this is a to-do list.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.280]   So how would you know what that feels like?
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:02.800]   I mean, it's like--
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.200]   Well, maybe we're waiting for the definitive Apple iPhone
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.120]   review site.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.120]   Is there one?
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.080]   I think there's any substitute for trying it.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.680]   I mean, it's why Shareware became something
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.800]   that turned into a business role.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.600]   No, you're right.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.400]   That's a good point.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.360]   And Apple products, particularly,
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.560]   have a very vital Shareware economy.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.520]   Well, and I think that--
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.560]   I think it's called Shareware now.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.720]   They call it "independent development."
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.080]   Try before you buy.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.280]   I mean, seriously, in fact, I think
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.720]   any good app these days is try before you buy,
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.560]   isn't it?
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.880]   It's for the most expensive, you know, the Final Cut studios.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.440]   But even still, there's usually a version.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.280]   Like even the--
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.840]   what's-- who are the guys that make all that cool stuff,
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.840]   screen flow and all that?
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   Yeah, they always have download 30-day download.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.240]   Yeah, 30-day download.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.680]   Like full feature, try this out.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.080]   Aperture, you know, like--
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:44.800]   No, you're right.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.080]   I think that's become the standard.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:46.960]   All the Adobe products.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.120]   Could they do it technically?
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.920]   Is that possible?
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.000]   There are two ways they must be.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.640]   I mean, I'm not a developer, but the two ways
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.240]   that I would do it, the janky way,
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.920]   is for everybody to do keep one trunk
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.840]   and then kind of push out a free version and a--
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.400]   Teterific.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.640]   Teterific did that.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.160]   But I mean, you know, I don't know.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.640]   I wouldn't want to constrain developers,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.200]   but I mean, the other way you could do it
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.560]   is to just kind of make it part of the--
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.240]   I think it would be entirely reasonable.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.360]   Well, to me, it would be reasonable for Apple to say,
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.040]   here's the deal.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.800]   If you want to be featured and you want us
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.440]   to talk about your product, you have to provide some kind of a way
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.400]   to have this be either a demo or you have to provide a free version
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.240]   and a story.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.960]   Like if you come up here and go like AAA, AAA, Tip Calculator,
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.880]   you know, for $20, well, you know what?
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.320]   Fine, we're going to put you in the library,
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.960]   but we're not going to put you in the window.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.440]   And I don't mind-- I have to admit, I don't mind testing
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.480]   something that is less than $5.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.640]   You know, it's what really gets me tweaked, you know,
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.400]   is when I'm spending-- you know, as soon as I start going over that,
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.880]   I expect it to work really well.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.440]   I know--
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.480]   So that's part of it for me is I don't-- if a program is $5 or even $10,
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.400]   well, if it's really awful, then I feel terrible.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.280]   But I'm willing to take a little chance.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.720]   It's not like these are that expensive,
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.960]   and there are a lot of 99 cents apps.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.320]   Yeah, I mean, 99 cents, I'm just like, oh, you know,
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.000]   I'm willing to play with that.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.120]   But-- and I think that a lot of people should think about
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.760]   if they're going to charge $3 or $4 or $5 or $10,
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.200]   putting out a version that maybe they charge something for.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.560]   But they don't charge--
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.360]   I don't think you guys are-- I don't think the three of us
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.680]   are typical in a couple ways.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.640]   I think, first of all, we spend more money on applications
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.320]   than most people.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.160]   I'm going to just guess.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:17.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.040]   And second of all, I think it's a philosophical difference.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.600]   And it's the way of saying, look, if I'm a craftsman,
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.760]   I should have the pride of what I've made to say, you know what?
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.800]   I'm pretty sure you're going to buy it.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.160]   It's really good.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.400]   And so you would never sit there in a cheese shop and go,
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.360]   no, you don't have a free sample.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.000]   You got to buy two pounds before you can find out
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.400]   what it tastes like.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.040]   And you have some way to say, look, I'm proud of what I did.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.640]   And I want to spread the word.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.560]   So yeah, sure, here's a free download.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.000]   I have to say, they're clearly issues with the app store.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.440]   The updates aren't getting posted.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.680]   There's definitely a bottleneck on approval process.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.880]   The approval process itself is flawed.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.440]   There isn't a good way for users to try before they buy.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.080]   I mean, we can go on and on.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.920]   At the same time, there's some really great apps,
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.000]   especially in gaming.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.680]   I see new games all the time.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.200]   I've been very happy with that.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.440]   I mean, my iPhone or touch is just
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.240]   a wonderful entertainment device now.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.920]   And there's some interesting, useful apps coming out.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.520]   I just saw a sound pressure meter and a oscilloscope
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.840]   for measuring sound.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.040]   I think you're going to see a lot of really intriguing apps.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   I think it's a minor structural issue
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.040]   that Apple can address and probably plans to.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.040]   Don't you?
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   No.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   No.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.040]   I think all of that stuff.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.680]   Well, we need to bitch about it, for sure.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.280]   Oh, no, and I'm not bitching for the purpose of bitching.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.280]   That's not my deal.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.400]   No, we need to get them on--
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.240]   we need to say, fix it, guys.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:35.760]   Why?
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.040]   This brings us to something we should talk about again.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.960]   Something we should talk about, which is Jason Snell's
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.480]   recent.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.480]   Let's get to that.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.360]   I want to mention, just because I don't want to get too far
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.840]   a field, there are lemon iPhones.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.080]   There's a big complaint in England
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.560]   about the 3G chips, the Infineon chips.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.560]   And there seems to be some thought
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.360]   that there may even have to be a recall.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.880]   One I think was an analyst said that there may have to be a
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.440]   recall of some of these Infineon chips.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.600]   Nomura Securities Analysts said the problems are typical
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.800]   of an immature chipset and a radio protocol stack, and the
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.240]   blame may lie with Infineon.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.920]   And they cannot resolve this with a firmware update,
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.440]   according to GigaOM.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.840]   Well, I was told the people who are having the same problem
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.920]   that I'm having with their phone when they walk in and show
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.440]   it to someone, they run a test, and then they give them a new
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:23.960]   one.
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   Well, you should bring it in.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.880]   I mean, it's--
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.920]   because I don't have time.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.600]   I mean, I'm traveling at the moment.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.320]   Yeah, you don't have time.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.960]   You're two hours early.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.320]   Well, yeah, well, there's that.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.480]   So no, I can try to find time.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.200]   This complaint seems to be more in Europe with Optus and T-Mobile
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:39.960]   in the Netherlands.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.040]   I haven't had any--
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.160]   mostly, it's like very poor signal strength.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.040]   And I haven't had any trouble.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.920]   So I don't know what's going on.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.840]   Now, the other thing that I'm--
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.400]   I must be lucky.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.640]   I have the best iPhone made right now.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.320]   The one that works.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.640]   The other thing that I thought was odd, and I'm trying to
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.480]   figure out what exactly happened was I installed phone
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.520]   Sabre, which evidently has been taken off the--
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.560]   What's that do?
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.720]   It's the best app that has been created for the iPhone so far.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.720]   It's the second best after the stabbing application, don't you?
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.640]   Is one you stab people with?
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.040]   So it's got a knife and it makes the psycho noise.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.840]   So there's the phone--
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.680]   Well, and there's also cowbell, which is pretty good.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.560]   Cowbell, so I beer is still a classic, still good.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.960]   So phone Sabre uses the accelerometer to--
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.200]   when you move your phone back and forth, it goes--
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.960]   Oh, yeah, but Lucas-- it was Lucas to pull that back.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.800]   Yeah, well, here's the interesting thing is I can still
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.760]   see it on my iTunes, but somehow it disappeared off
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.080]   of my phone.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.920]   And I noticed it yesterday.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.760]   I was like, I looked down on my phone and it was gone.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.160]   Look in your iTunes and see if it's still there.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.840]   It's still on my iTunes, but it's not on my phone.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.400]   Well, it should single your phone.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.440]   Yeah, I'm going to try it.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.600]   I just-- I don't know what happened.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.200]   No, I still--
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.440]   Well, let me check on that phone.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.440]   Check it out.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.880]   Yeah, because you can't get it anymore.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.000]   You can't buy it anymore.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.120]   But they say they're going to make
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.880]   a official Lucas-approved phone Sabre with many new features.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.880]   No cost $3.99.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.720]   Stupid.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.680]   Stupid.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.480]   I think they've missed the boat on the phone Sabre.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.280]   You know, I mean, people--
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.680]   Well, I think that all they had to do
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.040]   was not call it a Sabre.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.880]   You know, I mean, the thing is that they just made it funny,
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.120]   noise, whatever you have to do.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.760]   Well, that noise, you know.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.240]   [HONKING]
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.520]   I don't think people would buy noise.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.840]   No, remake it from scratch.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.400]   You can have a noise trademark.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.080]   Noise sword.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   People would buy--
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   Noise sword.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.800]   But you couldn't use the same sample,
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.920]   but I think that you would--
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.640]   How about you are my father, Luke.app.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.880]   I would get a 10-year-old boy to go,
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.200]   [HONKING]
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.000]   That's what somebody should do is lightsaber guy application.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.560]   You know, here you go.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.520]   It's called eye weapon.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.800]   And you choose which weapon you want.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.000]   One of them is a fake lightsaber.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.960]   The other one's a gun that goes, dee, dee, dee, dee.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.760]   And it's all the sound effects are done by the--
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   [HONKING]
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.240]   [HONKING]
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.480]   How did you make a machine gun sound when you were a kid?
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.760]   [HONKING]
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.400]   Really?
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.720]   I go-- [HONKING]
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.640]   That sounds like an anti-aircraft.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.120]   That's an AKAK.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:02.400]   AKAK.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.880]   You went-- [HONKING]
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.080]   See?
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.280]   I think AKAK-- AKAK is own by George Lucas.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.960]   Yeah, George Lucas owns AKAK.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.720]   Right there with George--
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.040]   George-- what?
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:11.840]   George, are you on AKAK?
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.440]   No, stop.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.640]   No, I'm sorry I said it.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.120]   Scott Boren's so glad he's not here.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.760]   By the way, we should mention the missing members of the team.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.720]   Andy Inaco had to spend time with his family today.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.080]   And Scott Boren is having trouble in gig harbor.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.840]   He's gone back up north for the remaining of summer.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.040]   And apparently--
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.280]   Up at gig harbor, the yacht just doesn't
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.920]   have the Skype capabilities.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.760]   But he has at least two now.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.760]   So we miss them.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.080]   But you know, it's fun just having three sometimes.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.080]   [HONKING]
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.360]   Anyway, let's move on to Jason Snell says,
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.640]   Apple is overextended.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.720]   His article is-- wait a minute.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.960]   What is the title of the article?
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.200]   Do you have it in front of you?
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.720]   It's on knacrummers.com.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.320]   Just went up a minute ago.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.120]   I mean, I'm sorry, macworld.com.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.480]   When Apple's-- I think it's very measured.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.760]   He said it's called when Apple's Reach exceeds its graph.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.000]   And what's summarized for us with you, Mr. Mann?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.960]   Well, he posted this on the Twitter
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.480]   and was saying, he's wondering if people are going
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.440]   to beat him up over this.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.560]   I thought it was really good.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.360]   And I'll let you guys read it to decide for yourself.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.040]   But what Jason basically says is, this is a company that's
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.440]   not playing in the minors anymore.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.840]   This is a growing company that's not working out of a garage.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.960]   And he does a little bit of explaining, like,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.000]   in terms of size and in terms of profit,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.040]   trying to say, well, this is not Microsoft.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.720]   And if you look at the actual number of people
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.880]   that work at Apple, given the amount of stuff
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.040]   that they're pushing out right now with the level of quality
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.320]   that they historically have had in their products,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.960]   it's pretty tough.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.600]   It's pretty tough.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.840]   And he also notes that Steve Alphop talks
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.520]   about how picky-heat they are about hiring, which is great.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.080]   It's a kind of first world problem.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.720]   And I think Jason does a pretty good job with it
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.520]   and says, hey, look, it's not that these guys aren't trying.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.880]   And I certainly want to be clear that when I'm criticizing
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.120]   stuff like mobile me, I never want
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.640]   to beat up on the people who are working on it.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.040]   I know they're working their asses off.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.680]   But clearly, looking at stuff like the launch,
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.080]   the multiple product launch and relaunch of July,
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.120]   whatever that was, 11th, and just saying, hey, look,
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.680]   let's give these guys a break.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.720]   They're really-- they're trying to do a lot of stuff
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.880]   at one time and something needs to change
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.440]   for this to be up to the level of quality
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.440]   that they're accustomed to.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.600]   I'd point out, though, Microsoft had five years
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.800]   slippage on Vista, even when you were a Microsoft-sized company.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.920]   And can hire everybody.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.360]   But you could have trouble with that.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.640]   There's more in the service of saying,
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.240]   well, yeah, that may be true.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.320]   But also, if you think that they've got--
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:36.840]   what is it?
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.760]   Something like a fifth of the number of employees
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.560]   Microsoft has?
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.680]   And they're trying to-- they're touching consumer products.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.240]   I mean, they've got a lot of stuff going on.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.680]   Should they focus?
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.280]   Well, I think there's also a pipeline issue of--
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.520]   or a bottleneck issue, which is that there is so much that
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:59.160]   has to go through Steve to get approved.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.560]   And that's something that is both good,
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.040]   because he generally has taste that we like for most things.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.360]   But it also can really slow and make the process very painful.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.880]   Well, this is one of the problems with the app store,
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.360]   isn't it?
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.120]   Somebody said he has to approve every app?
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.160]   Is that true, Steve?
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.660]   No.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.360]   I don't think Steve's--
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.280]   No, I think some of this-- a lot of this stuff is true.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.000]   And I think a lot of this stuff is fairy tales.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.160]   I don't think something like that could possibly be true.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.960]   He's running, what, like, three companies.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.280]   And he's not going to sit there and go, ah, quadruple
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.200]   a tip calculator, check.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.320]   You know, I was not going to happen.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   Do you think?
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.480]   Let me see if I can find the reference, because--
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.960]   No, I don't think that Steve is approving every application
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.640]   that's on the map.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.880]   I just think that when you have overall marketing things,
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.680]   or overall, like how the apps are going to work,
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.080]   or overall, for most of the stuff that at least is
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.920]   in the forefront, the rumors I hear is usually
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.640]   it has to go through them.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.040]   And there's usually, I think, with a lot of things
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.080]   that he doesn't pay as much attention to anymore,
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.680]   I don't think he's putting the same energy he was putting
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.760]   into pro apps and other things in the past.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   And I think that they get a little bit more room to run,
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.600]   which I think is, in some ways, good for some of these apps.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.840]   Lately, too, Apple has been--
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.760]   I mean, maybe this is what prompted Jason's article,
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.240]   but falling on the sword a little bit, Steve,
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.280]   sent that email out saying, yeah, we blew it on MobileMe.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.160]   They replaced the person running MobileMe.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.760]   I think in that interview that he gave recently,
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.640]   while he was saying, yeah, we've shipped 60 million iPhone
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.920]   apps, he also was kind of--
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.920]   Yeah, we've had some problems.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.240]   I mean, the thing is, is that we've
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.520]   had these things happen.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.600]   It's not like this had never happened,
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.440]   and now it's happening now.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.440]   I mean, we had version--
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.840]   God, there's been all sorts of problems.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.960]   All I want to say is 10.2.9.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.520]   Well, even-- and go back a little bit farther.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.280]   That was far there horror.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.520]   Apple had-- well, the MacBooks, they shipped thousands
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.120]   of broken MacBooks in the first few months.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.920]   They've had QC problems since day one.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   This is not unusual.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.280]   It's not unusual anywhere in the tech industry.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.280]   Yeah, but it's unusual in the sense that a lot--
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.040]   and I'm not to open a recent wound,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.280]   but the difference is the scale of it.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.840]   And the fact that it's touching a lot of people
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.800]   who don't have a lot of great Apple experiences under their belt
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.840]   to compare it again.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.040]   That's what you were saying, yeah.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.120]   They've got a day where they can't use their phone,
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.280]   and it doesn't just work.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.040]   And when that happens, the ultimate value
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.440]   that Apple brings in a lot of ways,
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.440]   in addition to good user experience and high build quality,
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   is the ability for all the pieces to fit together
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.600]   in a way that you don't even notice at their pieces.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.640]   And on the day when those pieces don't fit together,
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.160]   it's just another computer company.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   And that's when you see the wizard behind the curtain.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.680]   Yeah, and I think for a long time in the specialized area
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.880]   that we were, when it was 3% of the market or 4% of the market,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.000]   a lot of us would take--
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.960]   we'd take a couple of arrows every once in a while
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.800]   on a new board.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.840]   I think Berling just had his primal moment.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.320]   Did I?
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.320]   I think you just saw Mommy and Daddy doing it.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.800]   Most of my primal moments are not in this room.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.280]   And you know, you just realize that Apple is a company.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:57.800]   And--
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.320]   It's OK.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.240]   Let it out, Merlin.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.120]   I thought they were a live style brand.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:03.680]   I know.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.320]   Just let it out.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:04.920]   It's OK.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.720]   We've all had to come to grips with it in the last few months.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.200]   Well, it is a funny thing.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.840]   And I-- when you're talking about stuff with computers--
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.520]   sorry, my stupid mind keeps breaking.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.400]   Whenever you're talking about stuff with computers
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.000]   and talking about brand preference,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.240]   this is what Freud calls the narcissism of minor differences.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.720]   We are battling each other over such incredibly
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.120]   stupid, small things.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.400]   And in the grand scheme of things,
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.440]   this is all just a whole lot of garbage.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.640]   Yeah, but for one for that, we wouldn't have any shows.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.520]   So please, keep it up.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.000]   But have careers.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.000]   Because she careers.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.720]   But I mean, the problem at the heart of this
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.720]   is that, yeah, on the one hand, you've
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.400]   got the Apple fanboy types who are
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.920]   going to be apologizing and bowing and scraping
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.000]   and doing this Milton act where they're interpreting
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.400]   the ways of God to man.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.520]   And then on the other side, you've
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.000]   got people who are like, fail.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.320]   Apple's never done anything, right?
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.680]   And the truth is somewhere in the middle.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.200]   It's a company full of super smart people
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.320]   who work hard and that manage their brand well.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.720]   And when pieces of that don't fall apart,
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.640]   here's one thing also.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.280]   Let's be honest.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.120]   Jason says, well, then one thing I
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.600]   have to disagree with Jason with a little
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.920]   is a very minor thing in his article,
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.520]   where I want to find the exact phrase.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.440]   But he's talking about how things haven't gone well.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.920]   And he says, Apple has admitted as much.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.280]   And he refers to the memo that leaked that went on
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.200]   to Apple employees.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.720]   Well, that's not really admitting it.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.000]   That's a leak.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.680]   And that's not the same as somebody stepping up
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.240]   to the mic and going, you know what?
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.080]   Here's the deal.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.640]   We're sorry.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.400]   This is not meant.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.080]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.400]   They did that with Mobile Me and they gave you a free month.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.560]   They said it was unprecedented.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.320]   They said we screwed up.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.000]   Yeah, I mean, and that's the Mobile Me part.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.600]   And the thing is, is that it's just a sort.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.320]   It's one thing to say, I'm sorry.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.600]   And it's another thing to give away.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.440]   I mean, that was not an insignificant amount of money
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.240]   to give away a month.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.440]   I don't know what the number is going to be.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.280]   What are you talking about?
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.200]   The AT&T dealer.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.520]   For them to give a free month away because Mobile Me was saying.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.280]   Right.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.080]   That's not like they didn't cost them like 50 pounds.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.640]   They're a publicly held company though.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.480]   They have to.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.760]   We'll know what it is, but I'm just saying it was in the next quarter.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.080]   When it comes up, we'll find out what that number was.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.600]   But I bet you it's in the millions.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.080]   You know that they--
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.360]   Yeah, that's not insignificant.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:04.720]   You're right.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.560]   It was not an insignificant thing to do.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.480]   And at the same time, making these kinds of admissions
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.440]   is not insignificant.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.680]   And you can't do too much of it or the stock market punishes you.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.480]   You also, you can't play both sides of the street.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.200]   And here's the problem.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.880]   I mean, part of what I'm so tired of hearing about branding.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.480]   But I mean, sometimes it's really the only word
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   to use for what we're talking about.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.120]   What we're talking about here is that Apple wants
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.440]   to be your cool friend.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.800]   Apple wants to be your friend who has everything figured out
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.200]   and they're the authority on this stuff.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.280]   And they're the one who fixes your computer when it breaks.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.000]   And they want you to be your cool, tall friend
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.360]   who listens to Andy Rock.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.480]   And that's fine, except for when stuff breaks,
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.080]   and then your friend doesn't answer the phone.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.560]   Or when they don't admit that they really screwed up.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.320]   And in a world in which that brand
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.400]   really comes to be almost like a person, it's really valuable.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.000]   It would be super valuable for somebody to step up and go, look,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:47.880]   here's an update.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.680]   There's five things that have gone really dumb in the last quarter
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.960]   that we're trying to work on.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.520]   And you know what we know we screwed up.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.480]   And it's-- the thing with the free month, well,
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.680]   a free month of a service I've been
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.200]   auditing in New England since 2001.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.080]   Thanks a lot.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.040]   But I think the bigger thing to me would be to go,
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.480]   you know what?
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.200]   We know this is not right.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.960]   And that means a lot to us to let you know
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.960]   that that's not going well.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.880]   And we know it.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.160]   And here's a couple things that we're doing to work on that.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.600]   Not to me.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.280]   Steve does that.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.320]   And he gets ink out the ass.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.960]   Everybody's going to be going, yes, you're right.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.320]   Now they're a great company again.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.360]   But instead, they're trying to play their cards close to their vests
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.440]   like it's 1980.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.680]   And they can keep it in a garage.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.160]   The problem with being a big company, though,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.840]   is the other issue you get into is
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.200]   that you start making those public admissions,
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.080]   and you start inviting class action suits.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:29.680]   Exactly.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.440]   You don't want to be--
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.720]   So the issue is you have to-- as soon as you open your mouth,
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.040]   every time, that's something that can be brought into a court
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.320]   of law.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.800]   So if you make a mistake, and then people--
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   then these idiots, I mean, these idiots
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.400]   who think they-- because their battery last 15 minutes
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.960]   shorter than what it said, they should sue--
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.280]   thousands of them should sue Apple.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.880]   That's the stuff that you invite if you go too far down
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.320]   that path.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.800]   And that's the hard part.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.640]   And the other thing is, I think for a lot of us,
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.760]   as Mac users, who have been Mac users forever,
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.600]   and been through the bad times and the good times
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.920]   and everything else, a lot of this is like our band.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.800]   We had a local band, and they built up.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.560]   And it was really great when we'd come to see them,
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.640]   and now they're playing in front of 300 people.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:14.080]   But when they got to that next venue that was 1,500 or 3,000
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.400]   or 5,000--
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.960]   there's just a bunch of people who have been using this
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.720]   for a long time.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.360]   We went to see that band all the time,
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.800]   and now the band is going big.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.160]   Do you know what the hooters are?
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.160]   I can tell.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.520]   I was actually talking about live.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.600]   It was live.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.320]   You know, I'd go and see it when there was 50 people.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.480]   And then I saw them in Red Rocks, and it's like 7,000 people.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.800]   It's not the same.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   You guys are right.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.240]   You guys are right.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:33.720]   And I understand.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.960]   And I'm like, I'm small potatoes,
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.440]   and don't think about that kind of stuff.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.200]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.840]   But it's just-- it's something where--
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.280]   I think it's something that companies have to think about
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.040]   is the extent to which you--
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.640]   it's a phrase that keeps coming up for me,
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.440]   but how you manage expectations.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.800]   And if the expectation that you've built bank on
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.640]   is that you're incredibly reliable
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:56.360]   and you never see the strings, then when people can see the strings,
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.960]   and then when the strings break, and then when the stage falls apart,
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.320]   you have to do more than go.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:02.840]   Here's--
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.840]   Is it that bad?
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.920]   You think the strings are breaking the stages falling?
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.240]   I mean, I don't want to sit here and do some kind of Old Testament
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:16.160]   recitation of the problems, but I think there's a significant enough number of ways
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.480]   in which they're not delivering on--
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.080]   they're not delivering in the same making it look easy way
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.320]   that they did a couple of years ago.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:25.600]   For sure.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.520]   How much of this is the kind of expectations
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.920]   a normal company would face?
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.680]   Of course, yeah.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.240]   Microsoft got some similar press with the slipping of Vista.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.520]   But how much of this is the kind of thing a normal company would face?
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.560]   And how much of it is the double-edged sword of the Apple cult?
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.000]   Where people--
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.440]   Microsoft made software that let people basically move into your computer
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.520]   and use it as a cabin for six weeks.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.480]   Like, their customers have a whole different sense of how this stuff works,
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.440]   in my opinion.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.440]   Apple users, since the time I've been aware of it since 1987,
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.480]   Apple users have been people who made a conscious decision to come over and use
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.080]   this, pay the premium, and be part of the group.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.440]   And that's--
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.480]   and we can keep saying, well, they're just another giant company.
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:10.280]   But when they become just another giant company, they won't be Apple anymore.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.520]   Yeah, and I think there's going to be some growing pains.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.680]   I mean, I think that the issue is that I don't know if Apple knows how--
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.200]   it's kind of one of those things that I don't know if they know how
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.800]   to be a company with more than 15% or 20% of the market.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.560]   I would say--
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.520]   What do you think, though?
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.840]   I mean, because I'm curious to hear what you think,
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.400]   because I'm not trying to shut off what you're saying.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:30.880]   You think this is all just growing pains that are relatively minor in the big scheme?
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.440]   I have to say, there are a couple of different constituencies
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.400]   Apple has to consider.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:40.080]   Let's not forget the core constituency that uses Macintosh computers.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.640]   I mean, isn't that ultimately Apple's base?
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:47.120]   I know the iPod and iPhone are very sexy and press worthy.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.400]   I don't think people who use Apple computers are unhappy at this point.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.680]   Now, maybe MobileMe is not been a great success.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.200]   But on the other hand, I don't think it's been that big a failure.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.720]   I use it to sync with my iPhone.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.640]   It works fine.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:04.120]   I think the iPhone is in version two even more significant than it was in version one.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.360]   I think the app store is--
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.240]   We're seeing reports that they've sold 3 million.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.600]   They're selling 95 per store per day right now.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.360]   I mean, they're still every morning when I walk to work.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.120]   Every morning, there's a line of like 20 people outside of the Apple.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.440]   I know what you're saying, Merlin, is all these are new people
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.520]   who are going to have their first experience of Apple.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.920]   I don't know if they're having so much pain.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:31.680]   I think that we as Apple fanatics are having more pain because we expect more.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.000]   But Apple needs fanatics to grow.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.320]   Oh, I agree.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.520]   Apple wants to grow. They're going to have to admit, the folks that are coming over from
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.800]   PCs, I mean, it's like they're coming out of, you know, they've been eating gruel for
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.960]   the last, you know, for their whole life.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.800]   I think most people are pretty happy with the Mac experience, the Mac experience.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.000]   They come over there and it's like they get some steak.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.360]   We're saying, well, the steak isn't very, you know, I really wish they had put it left
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.640]   it in for a little while longer.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.480]   But it's still, it's not gruel anymore.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.560]   I guess that's kind of my point of view is that it may be bad for the point of view of
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:09.880]   a longtime Apple fan who wants it to be as polished and clean and beautiful as it ought
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.600]   to be and as it was or has been maybe in fantasy.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.560]   But I guess in some cases, you could say it's the case.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.280]   I think for most people, look, what are you comparing the iPhone to?
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.840]   You know, for Rizans, V. I mean, what?
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.000]   I mean, there's cell phones are God awful.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.640]   I'm just trying to say that I don't know much about business and I don't know much about
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.760]   big companies, but it seems to me that Microsoft has been able to succeed because they leveraged
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.120]   a lot of money that they made early on into efforts that went into things like business
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.400]   development and relationships with people who were in a position to buy things.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:50.160]   I think there's a lot of companies that become big or by being good about basically figuring
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.000]   out how to force people to use things.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.480]   Apple certainly has been an element of that.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.840]   It was true in the education market.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:59.240]   But now it seems to me that Apple has succeeded almost accidentally because they got their
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.320]   act together, they stripped down to what they were good at, and then they figured out how
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.240]   to make these total spazs that love their stuff until everybody they know about how great
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.240]   it is.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.800]   And once they got OS 10 going and figure out how it really working and became a platform
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.120]   that people like me could start recommending again, well then they've got this to use that
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.120]   awful word.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.000]   It becomes viral because now that enthusiasm gets passed on.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.280]   I'm not saying that enthusiasm is not there now, but I mean, if you're just 20% better
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.240]   than Microsoft, you know, is that really?
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.000]   Does that look like success for Apple?
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.840]   Or do you want to be like so much better that we're just literally leaving you in the dust?
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.480]   You know, if I can't type for a few minutes when I change apps, suddenly something to
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.200]   me does not feel as Apple like.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.120]   That says to me that something shoddy happened.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:45.000]   And that's, I think that's not the experience that creates super, super fans.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.040]   I'm going to come down on the side of I think things are much better than you think right
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   now, Merlin.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.360]   And I think that Apple is actually on a pretty good tear.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.800]   And I don't think there's significant problems.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.480]   There may be some finesse that they need to work on.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.680]   And I agree that I just have to say that the worst day with my iPhone is better than the
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.560]   best day with any other phone I've ever owned.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.400]   You know, I mean, so, you know, there's nothing about even if it's buggy and I got to lemon
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.760]   and I got to take it back soon, you know, it's still better than my trio.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.200]   You know, you know, that's what most other people, these new people are comparing it to.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.160]   I think they are, as you say, they're getting steak, not gruel, even if it's not perfectly
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.160]   cooked.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.160]   Right.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.320]   I, you know, I understand what Jason is saying also.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.200]   And I think Jason and you two, Merlin are coming from the point of view of the, you know,
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:38.720]   died in the rainbow apple fanatics and who live and breathe, you know, Apple and I want
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.280]   to be that way, but I also have to live in the other world.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.080]   And I see what people go through in the other world.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.840]   I don't think that it's as bad as his dire as you think.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.160]   I think Apple's still doing a pretty darn good job.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.640]   And its core is still the Mac, which, I mean, I don't think they're having trouble on the
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.640]   Mac side.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.840]   I'm interested what they're going to release next month.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.840]   I don't see them.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.320]   I think the product pipeline is pretty full, to be honest with you.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:09.520]   Is there any Mac platform that you feel like has, is overdue for a rep?
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.520]   What do you mean?
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.800]   Well, I mean, is a mini, maybe the mini is long in the two.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.960]   Oh, you mean in terms of hardware?
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.640]   I think the power books are the power books.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.640]   You know, they're too.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.640]   They're not overdue.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.640]   I think it's time.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.240]   I think they're not, I think they're getting long in the two.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   They're going to be.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.240]   I'm not talking about it.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.480]   I'm not saying OS 10 doesn't work or I'm not saying like my machine's not fast enough.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:32.400]   And I disagree a little bit that I'm like so far inside this that I can't see from outside.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:37.480]   What I'm seeing is, I hate to say the tip of the iceberg because that's cliche, but maybe
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:42.480]   the whiskers of the cat coming around the corner of, you know, this is going from like
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.320]   being something where we're obsessed with perfection, where like you hold an iPhone in
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.720]   your hand and you go right now, you hold an iPhone in your hand versus a trio versus
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.720]   anything.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.640]   So build quality in this is so superior that it's an order of magnitude better than this
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.960]   other thing empirically.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.120]   It's better.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.080]   And that is to me the level that they should try and maintain.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:06.640]   And I think in order, I think like 10 times better than everything else is what they need
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.880]   to aim for, even if it means keeping fewer balls in the air.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.160]   And I don't think they're going to go under.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.240]   I don't think they're failing.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.680]   I don't think any of that stuff.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.400]   I'm just saying that like it does not bode well for them to have this many bad stories floating
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.600]   around about how they half asked it.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.480]   And if they don't fix that, then they're not going to continue to have me grow.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   I'll get reasonable.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.480]   That's.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   Let's let's move on.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.800]   And by the way, someone in the chatroom pointed out that there is in fact a very good.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:38.120]   And I should have mentioned this iPhone app review site, touch arcade, which is from Mac
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.920]   Rumor's, our friends Arnold Kim who mentioned it when he was on here.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.280]   I should have I should have remembered that.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.480]   It's actually quite good.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.480]   Yeah, I know.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.480]   Thanks.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.480]   Sorry.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.480]   Sorry.
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.480]   That's it.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.480]   It's really good.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.040]   Touch arcade.com.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.080]   And they do a pretty good job of keeping up on the latest stuff.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:00.680]   In fact, some of the stuff that they've picked is free and really good.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:07.120]   I'm saying I think the iPhone rivals the DS and the PSP for portable gaming.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.920]   I think especially for casual gamer.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.680]   I wish I like games because man, these look fantastic.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:13.680]   They're great.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.680]   I'm playing.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.680]   Well, you like Scrabble.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.680]   Do you play Scrabble?
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.680]   There's a great.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.680]   I don't I'm bad at everything.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:22.560]   I've been playing chess online with people and it's been so much fun.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   It's cool.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.440]   I just I don't I don't play any games on my iPhone.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.760]   I don't play games because it's not because I don't like them.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.760]   It's because I you know, I like them too much.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.760]   It's good.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   I have on your phone.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.760]   It's a casual game.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   No, but this is good.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.040]   You're sitting in the doctor's office.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.480]   You know, you remember how much you liked that.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.200]   I took Twitter's for you can always tell when I'm sitting around somewhere because I'll
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   have all these Twitter's.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   That's true.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   That's true.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.480]   I had this idea for an app that I think someone should make.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.720]   I said this at iPhone Dev Camp.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.560]   I'm going to say it again because I think someone should make this.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:54.760]   They need to make the most perfect elegant iPhone app and it's an app called I checked.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   I-C-H-E-K-D.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:00.480]   And I checked as an application that does nothing but you click the icon and then you
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.480]   hit a button.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.400]   And what it does is it logs the fact that you hit the button and then you can get back
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.160]   and use you can export it as data and do different things with it.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.840]   But basically it's just a way to see how often you just needed something to do with your
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.840]   iPhone.
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.280]   There's a phrase people keep using is what it like what do you do with your iPhone
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.440]   when I'm said, I'll just check it.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.440]   You know, I just check out.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.600]   You know, yeah, but with I checked that goes on your home page and then you can do stuff
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   with the data.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.160]   Hey, I want to ask you, I want to ask you about iPhone Dev Camp and I won't do that
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.160]   in just a second.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.400]   I want to mention though that this show brought to you by my friends at Visa.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:34.920]   Your friends too, if you go shopping online, you want to know our friend Visa, Mr. Visa.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.680]   He does this thing called a credit card where you go and you shop online.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.360]   You don't have to worry about online fraud.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.520]   You know, you're thinking about all the fun stuff you're buying, whether it's a, gee, do
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:49.480]   I want to do I want the new, uh, frauds on the iPhone or, you know, I use a Visa card
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:54.240]   for everything because with Visa, all the purchase you make are safe and secure.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:58.200]   They have so many ways to prevent, detect and resolve online fraud.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:03.040]   Mainly, the main thing to remember the two words, you got to think zero liability.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.960]   You're just not liable for unauthorized purchases.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.160]   They protect you.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.080]   When you shop online, take your Visa card with you.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.080]   That's peace of mind safe secure.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   Visa.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:18.000]   I, uh, I have to say, uh, I'm very happy that I've been using my Visa card lately.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.200]   I'll just leave it at that.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.920]   Hey, let me ask, uh, you Merlin about iPhone dev camp.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   How was that?
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.920]   Were there a lot of people there?
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.240]   Yeah, there's a ton of people there.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.240]   It was pretty cool.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.760]   Um, this is kind of a new world to me.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.840]   I think it's kind of shoot off of the whole like bar camp type thing.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.640]   And for people who don't know, um, as it was explained to me by my very good friend,
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.640]   Dom, uh, it, uh, basically people get together.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.120]   It's a three day event, first day people mostly kind of hang out and talk and you know, you
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:48.360]   bring along code that you've been working on or, uh, you know, ideas that you have.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.280]   And there's just kind of this informal self organizing where people meet with other people.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.520]   Oh, hey, you're working on a card game.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.000]   I'm working on a card game.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.480]   You want to make this open source kind of app.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.480]   I want to do that.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:01.320]   So the second day people tend to kind of go heads down and try and make something or,
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.320]   you know, at least get a good something up to the show.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:08.400]   And then the third day, people show off what they made and give out awards and it's a
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   neat idea.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:13.520]   And it's just, it's just the kind of like super cool, like bootstrap, you do it yourself stuff
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:18.400]   that makes, uh, indie Mac developers, uh, so sexy given how unattractive most of the
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.320]   thought that you come to be there.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.440]   Are you a developer or are you working with a developer?
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.560]   No, apparently I'm, I don't know a thought leader, like people want to be to come and
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.560]   just thank you.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:31.560]   So it's me and, uh, Brian, the guy that does leaflets and, uh, and of course, Mike Lee,
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.400]   the world's toughest programmer and, uh, we just hung out and just kind of talked.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.400]   Um, and it was cool.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.840]   There was some neat stuff going on and, uh, smart people.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.360]   Well, it's neat that where was that?
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.360]   Was that San Francisco?
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.360]   Adobe puts it on.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.640]   It's, uh, you remember Scott talking about it last year.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.160]   Um, they basically opened up the cafeteria and a bunch of nerds hang out.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.920]   I, for three days, I realize there was going to be an annual event.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.920]   That's wonderful.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.920]   That's great.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.160]   And Don Dumpsegola, who's like one of the best guys ever, um, really kind of in addition
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.800]   to having a very busy job at Adobe, put a ton of his own time into doing that.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.440]   So people should, uh, tell us.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.760]   Adobe made any apps for them, for the iPhone.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.560]   They're just doing it out of the goodness of their heart.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.760]   I just think it's, I don't know.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.680]   It's just, I think it's because it's Dom Rocks.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   That's all I know.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   Right.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   Right.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.480]   I don't know from Adobe, but all my applications are definitely paid for.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   I did.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.760]   I finally bought all my Adobe apps.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.920]   Now if anybody wants to get.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   That's a pretty penny.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.280]   Anybody wants to give me a discount on that new, the second version of that photo application,
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   that would be nice.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.920]   Have you guys looked at that yet?
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.920]   Lightroom.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   All right.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   Remember I went to Tasmania.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.920]   That was the, that was the beta of it.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.040]   I was working with, all the way to Tasmania.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.040]   Just a little.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.560]   I was working with, well, you know, who went with us is the Lightroom team, uh, and the
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.560]   beta, beta team and then we had beta room of Lightroom two with these great pro photographers.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.880]   And it was a lot of the input that they gave this team as, as we went around Tasmania for
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:59.200]   10 days that became Lightroom two, especially the regional corrections.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.200]   That's the thing.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.600]   Now I know we don't have to stop born here to defend himself, but that is amazing.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:08.080]   And, uh, I just, I just installed it and it is, it is very cool.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.920]   I have to admit I'm still, you know, I'm still in this, in this land of, you know, I'm very
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.160]   comfortable with aperture, everything's sitting in aperture and I, you know, and for what
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.880]   I do on a day to day basis, just overall corrections and kind of fix it up.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:23.600]   You know, I like it, but I do have to say that, you know, that it's very, uh, dictating
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.160]   to have the, all the local corrections that you have there.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.160]   They're so easy to tell.
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   It's, you know, tell, tell an idiot, tell an idiot what that means.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:35.600]   Correct. The main, the main key about Lightroom is it's using the Adobe Adobe Camera Raw,
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   uh, um, platform, you know, the, the workflow.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:44.440]   So if you use Adobe Camera Raw within Photoshop, um, you, or you use Photoshop itself, you're
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.880]   very familiar with these controls and the obvious big, you know, the simple controls
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.880]   are things like, you know, levels and stuff like that.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.520]   You're not doing, you're not doing the kind of corrections you do, doing Photoshop with
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.600]   layers and things, but, but anything you would do with levels or curves, um, you're
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.840]   doing, you can do.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:03.040]   But here's the thing in the past Lightroom has been to the entire picture.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.360]   So you just, uh, you know, uh, brightness, you're just the entire picture.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.920]   Now you can say, I'm just going to do the sky.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:13.560]   So what Lightroom is very powerful in the sense that you can, and I was watching these
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.840]   pro photographers and look, they take really good.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.720]   They come out of the camera, you know, this guy, you know, Bruce Dale, 30 years with National
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.240]   Geographic, he takes an image, it comes out of the camera, ready to go in National Geographic,
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:30.280]   but then he sits down and he does some tweaks to it and he can really bring it to life.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:34.320]   And I don't mean major modifications, although there were other, uh, photographers like Peter
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.160]   Eastway is an Australian photographer who uses Lightroom to paint.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:41.440]   I mean, he'll, he'll take a picture of a horse in a field, you know, he'll black and white,
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.560]   everything but the horse, then he'll make the horses tail vivid.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.660]   I mean, he'll do real.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:48.120]   It's a painting and I've talked to him about it and I said, you know, you're not a photographer
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:52.040]   in the sense that you're capturing a single, he said, no, I'm a painter, but at the same
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:57.160]   time, what Lightroom can do is make that picture look more like what you saw.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.560]   How many times have you taken a picture and you look at the picture and goes, I didn't
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.560]   capture it.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.560]   I was there.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:05.120]   Lightroom can make it look like what you saw.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.120]   And to me, that's what it really is.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.120]   All right.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.680]   You know what I'd love and this is, I, I googled a little for this, but do you guys have like
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:16.360]   a rough and ready, good to go, shake and bake Lightroom preset for just generic digital
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   photography?
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.960]   Yeah, there's a ton of them, but I could just go like pop this up, like do this sharp
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.600]   and edges that I do.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.160]   And most pros do you can buy some.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:29.040]   You know what I would recommend my friend, Michael Olin, who was, who took us in this
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.840]   tour and was writing the book, his book is just about to come out a little disclaimer.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.120]   I wrote the forward for it, but I've been looking at the PDFs.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.120]   It's incredible.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   It's called Adobe Lightroom Adventure.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.520]   Don't we Lightroom to adventure?
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:42.360]   Don't get the first one because that's Lightroom one, but it's the new one with the Tasmania
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.320]   pictures and that is full of recipes exactly like that Merlin.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.760]   So, so you go through and you say, do, do, do, do, do it.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.240]   And now it's in there and it's a preset.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.840]   You can apply automatically when you import if you want.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.120]   Oh, Daddy like.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.120]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   I mean, I, I don't know.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:59.000]   I, I, for the longest time, I kind of frustrated with all the different like, oh, I've come
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.760]   up with a crazy new interface that doesn't look like anything else.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:05.040]   And it's like, oh God, again, but this is clever.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.240]   And it's so like it's, you know, like God bless the, the dream we've ever folks like,
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.760]   I know which dream we ever would do something like this where like just show me what I
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.240]   need right now and put everything else away.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.600]   But then also like, let me instantly leap into full screen mode to do stuff.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.160]   Lightroom's good for that, isn't it?
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:24.120]   And the big thing is, is if you, you know, it's a different, it's two different mentalities
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.120]   in a lot of ways.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.720]   I mean, if you, one of the things that I think Aperture is a little stronger at is managing
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.720]   lots of your photos and keep, you know, having vaults and having all this, you know, and,
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.760]   and kind of taking, you know, and some people are very uncomfortable with the way that it
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.760]   does that.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.280]   I happen to be very comfortable with it.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.040]   I also, you know, you have the non-destructive editing where you can do a lot of those overall
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.640]   corrections and aperture as well.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:47.680]   Where I think Lightroom is a little stronger is the non-destructive editing.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.320]   So you can do localized editing.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.960]   You can do dodge and burn some localized stuff in.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.360]   And there's a lot of new plugins that have come out for Aperture where you can do a lot
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.360]   of localized stuff.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.920]   But the problem is, is printing a new image.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.520]   You know, when you do that.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.400]   And whereas with Lightroom, I think that the localized editing, I think, is a little stronger.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.880]   But it, but it doesn't do the same level of management that I've seen, at least from
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.880]   what my experience is.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.120]   Well, you always preserve your raw.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.400]   Everything can be stored as a sidecar or in meta files.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.840]   Right, well, which is what you're doing with Aperture as well.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.880]   So I mean, that's, they're equal in that, in that respect.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:26.960]   But the amount of localized control that you have in Lightroom, I think, is a little stronger
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.120]   than what Aperture is.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:32.880]   Aperture is ability to manage large numbers of photos and do, you know, do that kind of
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.160]   stuff in the overall correction.
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:37.800]   I feel like it's a little bit more comfortable in that area.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.680]   So it just depends on what is most important to a photographer.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.920]   Because a lot of you have Alaska's will, which one should we get Lightroom or Aperture?
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.520]   And I'm kind of like, well, what do you do?
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.480]   You know, like, what, when you ring your image, what do you do?
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:51.440]   If you just do an overall value correction, if you do overall levels, overall, they'll
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.600]   both work really well.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.000]   And then it's just a matter of whether you want to manage your photos.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.360]   I do prefer the ACR, the Adobe Camera Raw workflow better.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.840]   I mean, I think it does a better job with raw than Aperture does.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:03.840]   But I've--
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:04.840]   So the socialization--
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.440]   The Aperture plugins are amazing, right?
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.240]   So are going to be really incredible.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.800]   And there's a new SDK now for Lightroom that came out with 202.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.880]   So we're going to see plugins for Lightroom as well.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.480]   So all of that stuff is kind of building.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.400]   What's great for us is that we've got two big companies.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   I agree.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   I agree.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.920]   I mean, it would really stink if there was only one of them.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.520]   Because they have to react to each other.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.600]   And I think that that's going to mean that no matter which way--
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:32.640]   I'm actually getting to a point where when I started testing Lightroom, I'm kind of glad
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.640]   I have both of them.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.480]   Because as I said, I have a large chunk of stuff that's in Aperture.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.800]   And I'm kind of resistant to pulling it out.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:40.800]   And I like it there.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.200]   And I like the way it manages it.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   And I'm very--
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.800]   What do you do for photo archiving, though?
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.120]   Well, that's the whole thing.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.640]   As you can set up a vault in Aperture, and it'll do it fairly medically.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.000]   So I just tell it where it needs to go.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.080]   And so the archiving stuff is done within Aperture.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:57.840]   I don't have to go.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:02.280]   And now the other thing is with Aperture, I backed up Aperture at one point in time
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:04.840]   before I really knew what I was doing before I understood vaults.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:09.560]   And I just grabbed the Aperture folder or grabbed the Aperture library.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.160]   And I just threw it on another drive.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.480]   And hoped that that would work later.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.600]   And I came back to it a year and a half later, just pulled it in and just said, that's my
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:17.600]   library.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.320]   And boom, I had all my photos back.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.480]   And I didn't have to think about them.
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:22.880]   I didn't have to think about the folder structure.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.880]   I didn't have to think.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.480]   Aperture kind of managed all that for me.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:31.680]   And so it just depends, as I said, I think it really depends on--
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:38.040]   some people are very uncomfortable with that heavy-handed management of their files.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.760]   But at the same time, there's a lot of photographers that just don't want to think about it.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:42.880]   They just want to know when they open it up, it's there.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.800]   When I'm editing, I'm not editing the original.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:53.240]   It's leaving it as a-- I'm editing just the metadata.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:57.560]   And so it just depends on which way they want to go, I think, in a lot of ways.
[00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:04.160]   And as I said, I think that I'd love to see Apple take on-- look at what Lightroom's doing
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.280]   as far as a lot of the localized corrections.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   And a lot of that stuff is just so fluid.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:12.920]   And I'm hoping that we're going to see more of that in Aperture, because it is something
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.080]   that is just a terrible one.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.840]   The new stuff in Lightroom 2 is just fantastic.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.040]   Oh, I'm glad you like it.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.440]   I feel this little-- I don't know.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.840]   I shouldn't feel proprietary.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.400]   But just because we were there and we were part of the beta.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.720]   And so I know all the guys on the team now, and I'm just really glad to hear that.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.960]   And I've been a Lightroom user since version 1.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.960]   I made the choice.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.280]   Well, my hard part is I know both teams really well.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.520]   No, and you're doing Aperture plugins too.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.400]   And we're going to probably do Lightroom plugins.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.960]   And I know, as I said, I know, the product managers and the teams that work on both of
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.040]   them really well.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.400]   And I like both apps.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.640]   The great thing is I think they're both fantastic applications.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:56.800]   And so I don't think anyone's going to go wrong getting one or the other.
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:01.160]   And I'm still-- I'm very comfortable in Aperture, but I don't know Lightroom that well.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.680]   And so now I'm starting to play with Lightroom.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.320]   And we'll talk about it again in six months.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.480]   And once I have my head completely around every feature of both of them.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.720]   Let me take a break.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.160]   We're going to do our picks because we've got to get out of here.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.000]   And I've got to get down to New Media Expo.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.760]   We're going to be heading down UR2.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760]   I know, Alex.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   I wish you were coming early.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.760]   For the thing, what?
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.640]   Thursday and Friday, we'll be broadcasting Twit Live from New Media Expo.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.400]   I think the show doors open at 10 and close at 4.30 each day.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.960]   So we will-- and we'll broadcast full time.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.960]   And everybody's going to be there.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.960]   Alex will be there.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.960]   The member's going to join us.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.360]   Veronica, Chris Marquart, Tim Street.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360]   Everybody's going to be there.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.360]   So if you want to see some of the best podcasters, some of the most interesting people in the
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.360]   business, they're all going to be down there.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.680]   We're going to be broadcasting live with all our cameras and tricasters.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.760]   And by the way, Colleen and Tony are on the road.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.720]   And they are more wired than I am because they have everything in the van.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.160]   They are using EVDO to stream right now at stickam.com/twitcolleen.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.040]   They're using the dash to update their tweet.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.200]   So you know exactly where they are.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.800]   They're going to be driving to Vegas.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   And it looks like a party in the van.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.680]   I can't believe it.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680]   Just nuts.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.680]   That's just crazy.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.440]   Let me mention before we go to the pics, our good friends at audible.com.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.600]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.720]   One of the things I forgot to give Tony and Colleen is an iPod full of Audible books.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.760]   Man, if I were doing a 10-hour drive, Audible would be my constant companion.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.200]   50,000 titles, some of the best books in the world.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.160]   And more all the time, you know, now that they've been acquired by Amazon, their mission,
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.840]   they've been charged with is to get every book in the world on audible.com.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.240]   They're building studios.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.960]   They're recording science fiction because they needed more science fiction and a lot
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.080]   of the sci-fi publishers don't do audiobooks.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.880]   Man, they've got them now.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.040]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Mac.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.520]   Break go there right now.
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.520]   Sign up today.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.000]   You get a free book, your choice.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.960]   And it's free.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.960]   It's free.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:05.120]   If you decide not to stick around, if you decide to stick around, I would suggest a subscription.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.680]   I have a two book among the subscription.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680]   How much is a subscription?
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.680]   Well, very different.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.640]   There's like several levels, bronze, gold, platinum, depending on how much I know.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.760]   They tell me about people who listen to so many books, they have real long commutes,
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.560]   they have several platinum subscriptions so they can get like six books a month.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.400]   Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex, how much does it cost or how much is it worth?
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.600]   Ah, there's a question for you.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600]   Understand.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.560]   You know what Alex Kerweld said.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.920]   He said, "A cynic is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.920]   Wow.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.920]   It was good.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.600]   So, did he also say we're all in the gutter but I'm looking at the stars?
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   Did he also say that?
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.080]   He said a lot of really annoying little inverse things.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.400]   He also said, "Supposedly as less words were either that wallpaper goes or I do."
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400]   Then he died.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.560]   And when he showed up in the US for the first time, he said, "Mr. Weald, do you have anything
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.560]   to declare?"
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.960]   And he said, "Only my brilliance."
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.600]   "Only my genius."
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.600]   "Only my genius."
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600]   You know what?
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   You know what?
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.600]   I hope you don't mind.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.120]   I'm gating your son.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.920]   And that's of course what got him in the end.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.160]   That's what they say.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160]   Oh boy.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.840]   With the Mark West of Queensbury nonetheless.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   Really?
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.840]   Look it up.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.560]   The Mark West of Queensbury, the guy who did the rules.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.320]   Richard Elman biography of Oscar Wilde.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320]   Look it up.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   You know, if you're interested in Oscar Wilde, there's actually a lot of Oscar Wilde's...
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   Not sure we've done this yet.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320]   ...on Audible.com.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   No, we haven't.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.960]   There's of course a picture of Dorian Gray's very famous novel.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.360]   But you know, I would get the importance of being a hermist, which is, I think, one of
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.840]   the funniest plays.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.160]   John Gielgood has one version, but there's one acted out by Dame Judy Dench and others.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.160]   Boy, that would be a great one.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:41.000]   It's the BBC radio version on the "Sentinary," the 100th anniversary of the importance of
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   being earnest.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   I mean, that's...
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   You know, I would play it, but you know, people go, "Oh, that sounds..."
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.480]   That's his funniest play.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.240]   It's so good, isn't it?
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.240]   It is.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.640]   I'm trying to find out this biography, son.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.640]   Sorry about volume.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640]   There should be.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.640]   There should be a biography.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640]   Richard Elman wrote it.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.640]   But it's really...
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   No, it's not.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.640]   No, you know who wrote it?
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.640]   Is it Simon Callowna?
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.360]   Simon Callowna did the Orson Welles one.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.360]   That was...
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   I read that too.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.360]   That was wonderful.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.760]   I'm just looking and seeing if they have a biography of him, because that would be great,
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.760]   too.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.760]   I'll tell you what.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.560]   The problem is they've got 40 books about by the selfish giant.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.120]   And I mean, there is so much stuff about Oscar Wilde.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.320]   And that's what's great.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.640]   That's what's changed the ideal and ideal husband.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.600]   That's what's changed since the last time when I first joined...
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.600]   You'd hoped that a book was unaudible.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:29.640]   You go there and you browse and you're amazed by what's there.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.800]   Audible.com/MacLadyWindamiersFan.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.160]   There's a good one.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.080]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:42.120]   Pick something by Oscar Wilde or read the biography.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:46.720]   You know, we're all lying in the gutter, but he was looking up your skirt.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.720]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720]   That's the wrong one.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   And dating your son.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.320]   Dating your son.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.160]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.160]   Thank you.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160]   Thank you so much for their support.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.760]   I'm really glad you mentioned the Oscar Wilde because I just looked here.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.160]   I didn't realize they had so much of his stuff.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.160]   That's great.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.480]   Oscar Wilde should have been on Twitter.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:08.200]   We're all pretty much trying to do Oscar Wilde, but he was the best.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200]   He was absolutely...
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.440]   There are a couple of people I was following.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   Buck Mr. Fuller's somebody was putting his aphorisms up for a while, but then they trailed
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.440]   off.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.000]   I wish somebody would do Oscar Wilde.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   He's got a lot.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.120]   I mean, he's actually the thing is really probably with reading the importance of being
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.920]   earnest or Lady Windamiers fan or whatever.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.640]   He's like, by the time you're done with the first act, you're like, "Get it.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.800]   You're really clever."
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.040]   Everybody says something incredibly clever every time.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.040]   And it's funny.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.040]   It's like Twitter.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.040]   It's really annoying.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.000]   Where like, you know, everything he says is incredibly clever.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.520]   He's the original Twitterer.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.360]   I think he's also a great poet.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.240]   He also wrote Wonderful Poems to the Ballad of Reading Jail, which is...
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.240]   Oh, that's right.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.240]   That's right.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.240]   And he did.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.240]   He was...
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.080]   Was he in the jail when he wrote the Ballad of Reading Jail?
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080]   Was indeed.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.080]   He was indeed.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.080]   It's a very sad story.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.120]   It would be covered heavily by the tablets today, one of the methods.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.120]   It would.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.280]   I don't think it would happen today.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.480]   Anyway, that's a great recommendation.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.480]   Let's get our speaking of recommendations, our picks.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.120]   Because I want to get going, get out of here.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.640]   Actually for those watching on Twit Live, we're going to do Windows Weekly in just a few
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.640]   minutes.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.480]   We decided to do a little early so that we don't miss another week.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.480]   You know, I'm going to start.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.480]   I know you guys don't like games.
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:18.400]   So I'm just going to do some games just because I know you won't for the iPhone.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.120]   I have been downloading, I have a full page now of more than a page of iPhone games.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   And I'm just loving it.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.960]   Do you ever play Chopper Command on your Apple II?
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.600]   You will love Chopper.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.320]   It's just like Chopper Command, only full color, great graphics.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.320]   And it uses...
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.320]   It is only better.
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.720]   It is because your phone is like 10 times more powerful.
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720]   Exactly.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.200]   And it uses the accelerometer.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:45.000]   So you fly the Chopper by tilting the phone, which really makes it fun.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.520]   To a cross, which is my... that is definitely the best crossword application, has now a
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.600]   free version which gives you New York Times classics.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   The Onion...
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.720]   The Onion actually has pretty good crosswords.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.160]   And this Sydney Morning Daily Herald news, whatever the Sydney paper is.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.360]   Gosh, I'm sorry I shouldn't know that.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   Sydney Morning Herald, right?
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.360]   Sydney anyway.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.960]   It's the Sydney Current Observer Times Pick a Youn Post.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960]   Pick a Youn.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:09.960]   I like to pick a Youn.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.960]   Mate.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   Mate.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.440]   And it doesn't have to be Twitch games.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.440]   There are a lot of great games.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.160]   Now I'm going to give you a couple that I've just downloaded.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:24.920]   So I'm not a wizard yet, but I'm really excited about playing them on the plane down.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:31.560]   One is Toybot, which the Toybot Diaries, which just came out and is a platformer with great
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.320]   graphics.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.600]   Loads of fun so far.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.520]   And that is only $3.99.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.800]   I think game developers are...
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.960]   Let me play a little bit of the music.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.960]   It's so cute.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:44.920]   These developers are starting to realize that they don't have to charge a lot of money because
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.920]   they're going to make it up in volume.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.560]   It really is pretty clear that people on the iTunes stores are not wanting to pay $10.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.000]   Oh, the music's are good on these.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.120]   Anyway, that's a fun one.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.640]   And I know you're a big fan, or maybe this is what got you out of gaming, Alex.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.640]   Yes.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.640]   What was it?
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.400]   Defender, the Castle Defender?
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:10.880]   Well, I mean, there are many games that I can look back on and that got me out of it.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.760]   Yeah, a lot of the challenge games.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:20.000]   Like I was at a friend's house and he has a civilization.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   Oh, it's fun.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.040]   So I'm at Andy's house and I'm playing civilization and it just had to stop.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.080]   Because literally I would just look up and it would be like two hours later.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.480]   I'd be still playing.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.680]   There was a discovery head a game called Canon Challenge, which isn't...
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.680]   It's kind of...
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.160]   It's an old-style game, although the graphics are beautiful.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.960]   It was shooting cannons and aiming them and all that stuff.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.560]   And I always kind of enjoyed those where you're firing it.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.560]   Yeah, I...
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.160]   Brand new for the iPhone.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.760]   I'm closing my eyes and just closing my ears and going, "Dada, dada, dada."
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.360]   Brand new for the iPhone.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:50.360]   Free...
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.360]   Free...
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:54.160]   If you only get one game, get the free games.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   There are...
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160]   Do you like monkey ball?
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.160]   Have you played monkey ball?
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.160]   No, I got it.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.160]   I played it.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.160]   I bought it.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.160]   It's not my kind of game and it requires it.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.160]   A little bit too much accelerometer motion.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.960]   You can't follow the game because you're tilting the thing so much.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960]   Right.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.960]   Okay.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.520]   If you like that kind of tilt or game, get the free labyrinth.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.520]   With a labyrinth game you had in your basement as a kid with a...
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.520]   Next to the ping pong table.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.520]   Oh, you saw the labyrinth spiel.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.520]   I used to love that.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   Well, they got a really, really good version.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520]   I just sketched.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.520]   Did you download the iPhone?
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520]   I just sketched it.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.520]   It was fun because you shake it to erase it.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520]   That's so funny.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   No.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.520]   Do they make an Oregon Trail for the iPhone?
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   No, I haven't seen it yet.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.520]   But you know what?
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.520]   You would like...
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.520]   There is a Frots now.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.520]   Which means you...
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.520]   Is that the tech...
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.520]   The tech...
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.520]   The tech adventure game.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.520]   You can now play all of the Zork...
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.520]   All of the...
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.520]   I'm just gonna ask that.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.520]   Not only Zork, but every single game ever released.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.520]   Uh...
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.520]   Colossal Game Adventure is on there.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.520]   No one's put Mame on there yet, have they?
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.520]   No, but it's just a matter of time.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.520]   I would throw my phone out the window if it had me.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.520]   It's just a matter of time.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.520]   It would be done.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520]   It would be done.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.520]   It would be done.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.520]   Because then I'd spend the rest of my life trying to find two controllers
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.520]   like I play Robotron 24 hours.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.520]   I mean, I bet you...
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.520]   I bet you with the hand controller, Tempest would be really...
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.520]   I'm telling you, this...
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.520]   The iPhone is...
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.520]   If nothing else is completely underestimated as a gaming platform.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.520]   Especially for casual gamers who want to do things like chess or
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.520]   Scrabble or Solitaire.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.520]   It's a great platform.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.520]   I'm playing more games than anything else.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.520]   I just have to have it a blast.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.520]   So there's a couple of picks for you.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.520]   But you know, a couple of free ones.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.520]   $3.99.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.520]   To about it's great.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.520]   Just the gaming has just gotten really, really good.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.520]   How about you Merlin?
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.520]   What do you got for us today?
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.520]   I can't remember if this one...
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.520]   Oh, God, I got to fix this mic problem.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.520]   Hey, hey, hey, Mac, break weekly nation.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.520]   So you hear how my volume goes up?
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.520]   Down your notch and then it comes back up again.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:43.520]   If anybody can out there can tell me how to make my input volume not go down.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.520]   I will write you a song and post it on the web.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.520]   So it's not happening in Skype.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.520]   It's happening in the system preference pane.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.520]   If you go to your sound preference pane, like right now,
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.520]   so ordinarily I'd like to be here so you can actually hear the actual tone of my voice.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.520]   But unfortunately it's here and I'm always with the screen.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520]   So if I could...
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.520]   You sounded really good all day today though, I have to say.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.520]   Yeah, well I had a lot of coffee.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.520]   Yeah, so if anybody can figure that out, post it somewhere.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.520]   Don't email me, but post it and then I'll write a song about you.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.520]   I don't know if this has been done here, but phone view, have we done phone view?
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.520]   No, what is phone view?
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.520]   Who do I learn about this from?
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.520]   I learned about this from via D. Moore and via Chairman Gruber.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:29.520]   Chairman Gruber was looking for a way to get stuff off the iPhone and Dan Moore and...
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.520]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the old...
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.520]   We have recommended it, but it's been updated.
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.520]   It's Ecamm.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.520]   It was...
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.520]   They changed the name because it used to say it was some other name.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.520]   It allows you to look at it as a disc, right?
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.520]   Megaphone, that's what it was.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.520]   Well, no, what this does is this is pretty bad.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520]   I'm gonna...
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520]   No, no, no, it's the same.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.520]   It's megaphone.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.520]   It was a pick, but it's updated, so do it again.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.520]   Okay, well what it does...
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.520]   You never listen to my picks anyway, Marlon.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.520]   Which one are you?
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:01.520]   Sorry, I got a lot of problems, Leo.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.520]   I love you anyway, Marlon.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.520]   I love you.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.520]   Here's the idea.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520]   Here's the idea.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.520]   You got this device that you paid all this money for.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.520]   You got this douchey iPhone that has all this stuff on it.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.520]   And Steve, in order to make it easy for you, it won't let you do stuff with it.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520]   Right.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.520]   And so it's kind of a pain in the butt to like, you know, it's...
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:20.520]   You know, obviously you kind of have to interest everything to iTunes and it has to be your information
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520]   priest.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.520]   But there's some stuff you love to be able to get off there that you can't get off there unless
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.520]   you're going to, you know, roll the dice with, you know, jailbreak in this thing.
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.520]   So anyway, phone view is this program.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.520]   I have not bought it yet.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.520]   I'm still in the demo mode.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.520]   I suspect it's in the sub...
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.520]   I bought it.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.520]   I bought it.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.520]   It's worth it.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.520]   Do you remember how much it was?
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.520]   It's not expensive.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.520]   Twenty bucks.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.520]   I don't know.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.520]   I'll find out for you.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.520]   You keep talking.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.520]   It's from Ecamm Network, the people who make the wonderful call recorder for Skype.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.520]   Twenty bucks.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.520]   You know, I love that.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.520]   I finally got that call recorder installed.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.520]   It is so awesome.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.520]   Isn't that great?
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.520]   I use it all the time.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520]   Is that what you guys do?
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.520]   I have a couple of lenders in Merlin on your work.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.520]   Our workflow is mature.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.520]   It records into a directory.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.520]   I zip it.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.520]   I send it to sandwich by F.B.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.520]   and the rest is magic.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.520]   That's the way we should do this.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.520]   So, rat hole, somebody hears an idea that somebody should steal.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.520]   Make an application.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.520]   You know who should steal this Paul from Rogamev?
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.520]   I should steal this idea.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.520]   Create an application.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.520]   I'll turn my volume back up.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:17.520]   Create an application that lets you take three tracks that have been back, what do you call
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.520]   it, double ending?
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.520]   Yep.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.520]   And will to the best of its ability.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.520]   Or in this case, three input.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.520]   Right.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:29.320]   And just throw these at this app and it does the best it can to create a multi-track file
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.520]   where it syncs all those up.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.520]   Audio stitching.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.520]   So, what it's called?
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.520]   Well, that's what I would call it.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.520]   Audio stitching.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:35.520]   Audio stitch would be good too.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.520]   Auto stitch.
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.520]   Yep.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.240]   And the idea is though, there's tons of people that are making podcasts and want to do high
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.520]   quality podcasts, but it's a pain in the butt to do this unless you know what you're doing.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.520]   Create an app that would do that.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.520]   Okay.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.520]   So, Paul, still that idea.
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.520]   I love you.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.520]   Hi, Paul.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.520]   I keep on talking to guys about that.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.520]   You guys could do it.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.520]   You guys could do it.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.520]   I mean, that would not be that hard to do.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.560]   And then it could ping you to say, "I need your help to adjust it at this point."
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.760]   If the call dropped, okay, well, now this is two parts.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.880]   I might need a little help, but I'll still show you what you need to do manually to fix this.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.880]   Who wrote "Levelator"?
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.880]   I can't think of his name right now.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.880]   I think that's...
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.880]   Okay.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.880]   It was part of his name.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:08.880]   Okay, but it was the engineer that worked with...
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.880]   He interviewed him.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.880]   He's done a lot of...
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   He's brilliant.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   R&D in that area.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.040]   And he's done some brilliant tests in that ballpark.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.480]   So, he'd probably be the one closest to it.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.680]   One of the most inadequate feeling dinners I ever had was dinner with Doug K. He's really,
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:27.680]   really smart.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.680]   And he's a smart guy.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.560]   He's probably listening right now, Doug, if you're listening, call in and say hello.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.560]   Oh, Doug's not listening.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.560]   Doug's busy.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.560]   He's got stuff to do.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.560]   He's a big fan.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.560]   He's a big fan.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.560]   Oh, really?
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.880]   Phone view lets you get into your iPhone and grab a bunch of stuff off of it that you
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.040]   couldn't get any other way.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.560]   So if you can think a little bit like the typical kind of...
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.480]   Not a three-pane, exactly, but it looks a little bit like iTunes.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.280]   And it's got sections called data iTunes and photos.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.200]   And as a subsection, iTunes is pretty much what you expect from iTunes.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:57.440]   You can go in, you can manually grab stuff off of your and move it around.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.440]   You can grab it and take it to your...
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.440]   I think you can take it to your desktop.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.440]   I haven't tried that yet.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.440]   Yes, you can.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.880]   You can play music from it directly.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:03.880]   You can grab your camera.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.520]   But don't get excited.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.960]   You can't take music off of the iPhone that way.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960]   Okay, that was my question.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.960]   It's not an iPhone ripper.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.960]   No.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.960]   I don't care about any of that personally.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.680]   I use buzzes thing anytime I need to get anything off of an iPod.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:15.680]   Buzzes...
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.400]   Nothing gets anything off an iPhone, unfortunately, that I know of.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.640]   So they get you?
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.840]   But here's what you can do.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840]   And this is bad.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.400]   First of all, you can use it as a disk.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.400]   That's bad.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.400]   It lets you put files on here.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400]   That's cool.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:33.320]   Now, if it would only sync with .mac or whatever they're calling it, it would be awesome.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.000]   You can grab your contacts off of here.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.280]   Here's the sexy.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.280]   Your notes.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.240]   You can now get to your notes and you can edit them and you can mail them from here.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:44.920]   Right now, the notes on my iPhone are useless because I can't sync them.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.560]   You can also grab your call logs.
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.520]   All of your call logs you can grab off of here.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.080]   And you can even grab, get this, all of your SMS messages.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.560]   I'd like that.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.080]   I would like to get the SMS messages.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.280]   What I really want is an easy app.
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.360]   And I've been looking around and bouncing around.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.360]   I can't...
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360]   Maybe someone can...
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:04.560]   I'm sure someone will Twitter me now.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.800]   I just want to move all of my messages from...
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.360]   I've got 40,000...
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.160]   I'm sorry, yeah.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:14.800]   Over 100,000 messages in mail.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.720]   And mail takes like three minutes to start up when you have that many.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.720]   And I just want to move...
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.720]   I don't want to lose them.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.280]   I just want to move them all to Firemaker.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.280]   I just want to...
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.040]   I just want to export every week once a week.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.800]   What I want to do is just take everything out of mail and put it in the file.
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.240]   Can I make a suggestion for like a hack for that?
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.160]   I mean, first of all, there's all kinds of apps that will do this for you.
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:36.040]   But my hack for that is to create a smart folder that would basically group a bunch of
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.320]   stuff in the range that you're interested in.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.280]   And then you can just drag that off to wherever they need to go.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.920]   But I mean, actually there's apps that would do it a lot easier.
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.440]   I just haven't found any clean apps.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:50.720]   I'm trying to find something that will cleanly do it.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.440]   And I haven't found anything that...
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.760]   One called like mail.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.280]   I want to say like actually mail archiver.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.280]   Is that the name of it?
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.000]   I think that sounds familiar, yes.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   And then it brings it...
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.480]   The other thing that's scary is actually having something try it.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.480]   Oh, I know.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.760]   I'll grab one of my inbox.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.680]   I finally got MOSI running regularly.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:09.680]   Thank God.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.320]   So I've gotten a little more gutsy.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.320]   Anyway, I'm going to finish this thought and take my ADD medicine.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.840]   I think this is a neat app.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.800]   It is called PhoneView.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:21.120]   And it is price TBD.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.120]   How much?
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.120]   20 dollar.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:24.120]   20 dollar.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.440]   I guess pretty good deal.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.480]   And they seem like pretty good people.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.000]   And that's my pick.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.120]   You know, Hawk Wings still do it's Apple Mail extension page.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.480]   He used to have a fantastic page about that.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.480]   I have no idea.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.480]   Hawk Wings.net.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.160]   The problem was a lot of extensions broke when they...
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.400]   The latest update to mail, right?
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   Have we ever pimped...
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.400]   Pimped...
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:46.400]   Let's pimped them now.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.400]   Great site.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   It's fantastic.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   H-A-W-K.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   Hawk.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.600]   There's like a hawk on the Mail.app.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.600]   There is a hawk on mail.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.600]   Isn't that what it is?
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.600]   Oh, yeah, there is a hawk.
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:58.600]   You're running.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.600]   I never noticed that.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.600]   So I think his last fence pronounce "Aiden."
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.960]   Tim Gaiden has a fantastic site that's based around mail in particular.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.880]   But it's so it's everything you'd ever want to know about Mail.app.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.360]   But he also touches on lots of other apps.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.120]   It's very thoughtful, well done.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.320]   And how they recommended Hawk Wings.net.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:20.000]   Alex Lindsey, your pick, then we'll wrap this thing up and head out to Vegas.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.920]   Well, I'm at Seagrap, and so I feel like I should make a Seagrap-y kind of pick.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.000]   And so of course it's going to be a couple of Alex's.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.240]   It's not going to be something that most of us are going to pick up.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.280]   But I have to say that I just saw there's been a bunch of new stuff.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:41.560]   On the Mac, the thing that I think was the most interesting was Cinema 4D releases their
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.280]   new version 11.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.880]   And for those of you who are thinking about 3D or you're diving into it, it's probably
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.880]   one of the easier.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.480]   I mean, of course there's Google Sketchup, which everybody should own.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.440]   I mean, everybody should download because it's free.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.440]   And so...
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:59.560]   Is that the 3D building thing you guys did on Mac Break?
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.560]   That demo, isn't that cool?
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.360]   That's got to be one of my favorite Mac breaks.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.360]   It was mind blowing.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.160]   And the app is just fantastic.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:13.280]   And it's free.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.480]   And so you can build your house or build little...
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.960]   What happens generally is that I actually, you know, pre-vis everything.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:19.960]   By just...
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.000]   I go into Google Sketchup and I just draw out what I want as a digital set for, you know,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.600]   some of the work that we've been doing for our clients.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   And then I send it to someone.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:30.680]   Now what most of them do next is they bring it into a program called Cinema 4D.
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.360]   And they will build it out and render it and so on and so forth.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.720]   And now there's other great programs on the Mac like Moto and a lot of other stuff.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:41.880]   But as far as like an all featured, you know, all the animation, all the, you know, all
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:46.000]   the things that you need right now, you know, Cinema 4D is probably one of the most developed.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.520]   And the great thing about it is it's just really easy.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.320]   It's easy to get started.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:54.160]   And that's the thing that with a lot of 3D apps, you know, it's not as easy as Google
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.560]   Sketchup, but it's like once you get to the point where Google Sketchup is not quite enough
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:01.160]   for you anymore and you really want to do some realistic rendering and you really want
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:06.360]   to do maybe some logo animations or maybe some digital sets for your podcast.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.320]   And we're going to show, we're going to do a lot more about this in the near future on
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.480]   some of the other podcasts.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.480]   But I really would suggest downloading the demo on what they really updated in this last
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.600]   one is digital, what's called camera mapping, which is how they use digital maths.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:25.120]   Digital maths are kind of the secret sauce to most visual effects films where all the
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.360]   backgrounds are being created and kind of this half what we call two and a half D. It's
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:32.120]   kind of half between Photoshop and half and 3D.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.680]   And that kind of stuff is, I mean, Cinema 40 is the state of the art in that area right
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.680]   now.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.360]   I mean, they just really, they have a guy's sending image works really pushing on them
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.160]   to build some really cool tools.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.840]   And so it's about, I think it's about two or three Alex's.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.480]   It depends on what you want to get.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.200]   It can be a lot of Alex.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.560]   Well, it's one, it's he, it sounds better though when it's only one or two or three.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.280]   It's not, you know, but no, you can get, you can get a starter.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:02.680]   You can get a demo version that you can play with for, you know, for free.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.560]   And then you can, there's a, there's a small version that's like four or $500.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.000]   And then there's the pro, you can keep on adding stuff.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.760]   So you started like $500 and you end up at $2,000 buying the pieces, buying the pieces
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:15.760]   that you need.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:16.840]   I wouldn't suggest buying them all at one time.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:22.200]   Now the, the pixel core gets it in a different model, which is much more affordable.
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:27.200]   So, so I don't, I had a feeling not many Alex's were being exchanged for this.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.480]   No, no, no, no.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.120]   The, the, what I'm saying is members get access to it in a different way.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.120]   Okay.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.120]   And not me.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.120]   One of your evaluation copies, maybe that you get.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.120]   No, no, no, no.
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.120]   I mean, I mean, all of that.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.680]   I have, I think I have evaluation copies of like every 3D app in existence.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:47.360]   And so, so I do have that, you know, but, but the, but the, the members get, get a different
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360]   model.
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.360]   That's fantastic.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:54.160]   So the, but in general, though, I would, the demo, I think is 30 days or something like
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.160]   that.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.160]   It's definitely, if you think you're thinking about 3D and you want to kind of play with
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.400]   something a little bit bigger, it's definitely worth checking out.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.400]   Wow.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400]   All right.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.040]   So I have to say thank you very much, Alex.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.040]   Head to Vegas now, stat Pronto.
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.640]   Tomorrow morning, it's first flight out, first flight out I'm taking on.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.440]   And here's the thing I'm taking Southwest because Virgin doesn't fly from LA to Vegas.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.800]   Well, Dane and I away, but you as we're flying over in our fabulous Virgin, Virgin America
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:25.480]   jet with the, with the infrared light, or what is it?
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.720]   Ultra violet light blink.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.720]   Are you flying first?
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.760]   No, I'm paying for it this time.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.760]   I'm playing.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:34.960]   My favorite part, my favorite part of that in addition to it being the most amazing coach
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.880]   flight in history is that it's incredibly cheap.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.760]   I, it's, I don't understand it.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:44.400]   It's got to be a loss leader, but I don't care if I can fly to LA round trip for 165
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:45.400]   bucks.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.400]   I will take it.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.880]   Dudes, it's been a pleasure.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.960]   We will talk again next week.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:58.880]   Don't forget to follow the coverage of the new media Expo live at Twitlive.tv on Thursday
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:02.440]   and Friday, the 14th and the 15th.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.640]   And I guess that's all I have to say.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.640]   Another Mac break.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.800]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.360]   I can't say that.
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.160]   Follow the nice Merlin at Twitter.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.720]   Oh, no, no, bah.
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.080]   Or the, or the bad Merlin.
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.080]   Nice.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.080]   Nice.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.080]   Merlin just said hi and said thank you for sending the followers.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.080]   I know.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.080]   He was so sweet.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.920]   He's such a nice Merlin.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:22.520]   Why can't you be more like that nice boy?
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:23.520]   Look at me.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.600]   I'm Merlin and I'm mean.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.600]   Is that why you did it?
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.080]   Cause people were like giving you a hard time.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.080]   I don't do this.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.080]   What are you talking about?
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.080]   Oh, it's some other guy.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.080]   Hey, it is.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.280]   I like, what is that?
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.280]   Asky.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.280]   Is it a thong?
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.280]   What's that?
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.880]   The little Japanese smiley face.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.880]   And that nice.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.880]   Nice.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.880]   Nice.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.880]   Merlin loves Japanese culture.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:46.880]   He's very in.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.880]   He's a Harajuku guy.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:50.880]   Harajuku girl.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.120]   So, and of course you look nice today, which is just great.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.080]   And I wish you'd put another one out because I've listened to them all now and I don't
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.080]   have anything to listen to them.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.680]   Well, vacation, but end of the month there will be new ones we recorded.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.680]   And yeah, when you come in.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:04.880]   I'm having dinner with Simpson tomorrow.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.080]   I'll ask about your company.
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.080]   Really?
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.080]   Have you, have you prepared?
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.080]   What?
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.080]   Why?
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.280]   Well, you know, you're not recording this, right?
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280]   Okay.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.280]   He's, you know, he's a nice guy, but he's got, he's got a lot of problems.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:22.280]   I should be, you know, alerted to a word of, you know, I would not bring a lot of cash.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:26.280]   Oh, because he calls him bar games and he's got these little bets he comes up with.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.400]   It basically involves him hitting you and then taking your wallet and he drinks a lot.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.640]   So he doesn't even remember it and it's hard to, in court, it's very hard to pursue.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:39.080]   So I would go someplace cheap and bring some extra people.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.080]   Okay.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.240]   That's a good, good advice.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.240]   I appreciate it.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.240]   The sandwich isn't going to be there.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.200]   It won't be a gang, will it?
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.360]   It's a good thing because he uses him as kind of his wingman.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.360]   So be careful.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.160]   I'll be looking for him both.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.640]   You look nice today.com.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.440]   Well worth the time and sweat glands.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.600]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is at the Pixelcore.com, Pixelcore.tv for all those new shows that
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.160]   are coming out any minute now.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.160]   What's happened to Gear Media Tech?
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.400]   Somebody asked me, is there, are there a new show than that?
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.400]   Yeah, we have it.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400]   We have them.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.400]   They're in the pipe.
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400]   We've got two in the pipe right now.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.440]   We've done later this week.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.680]   And it's just a matter of, we've just been annihilated with production for other people.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.600]   And so there's one of you getting that introduction to the light panels.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.600]   There's one of us lighting.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.600]   Oh, that was fun.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.600]   Yeah, you shot us.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.840]   We were lighting the studio with Pat Gross one of light panels.
