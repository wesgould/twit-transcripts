[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.040]   Our last Mac Break Weekly before the big event.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.840]   We have gathered together the royalty of Macintosh technology
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.640]   news, starting with Mr. Andy Inako over here
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.320]   to my left from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.680]   Queen Andy, we'd like to call him.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.680]   And he's at Comic Solage.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440]   It looks like a comic book shop, but it's not.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.200]   It's a software company.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.000]   No, no.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.440]   They're the guys who do that really great comic book app that
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.160]   DC and the Marvel everybody are distributing their books
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.080]   through.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.040]   And since I'm in New York for the release of the New Kindle,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.560]   they're next to offering me some office space
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.680]   and some Wi-Fi here.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.520]   Because their business is pumping out
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.560]   huge graphics files to millions and millions of servers.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.440]   So they got pretty good bandwidth.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.920]   Well, that's exciting.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.000]   We'll talk about the Kindle Fire in just a little bit.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.800]   But we have other news as well.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.320]   To my right, Mr. Alex Lindsey, who cannot stop playing
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.960]   with an Android phone.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.920]   And Android phone.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.800]   You know, this is the Sprint Galaxy S2 on Sprint.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.440]   It's called the Evo Touch E-G4O.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.800]   Epic 4G touch.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.240]   Epic 4G touch.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.640]   Thank you.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.560]   That was Eileen Rivera of all about Android.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.360]   She knows these things.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.680]   And that just came out on Friday.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.080]   This Galaxy S2 is really the class of phones
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.120]   that the iPhone 5 will be competing with.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.320]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.240]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.080]   It's awesome.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.680]   4 and 1/2 inch screen.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.760]   I really like it.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.960]   But it doesn't feel big, does it?
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.520]   It doesn't.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.840]   It just--
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.800]   Yeah, just right.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.880]   It's the camera is actually--
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.480]   8 megapixel.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.160]   But I imagine this is what we're going to see in the iPhone
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.420]   5.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.520]   Let's get to that in a second.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.840]   But I have one more person to introduce.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.080]   Of course, that's Don McAllister.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.000]   In fact, we even have his own-- he has his own jingle.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.640]   Hello, Don.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.520]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.120]   Good to see you.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.960]   Welcome back.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.680]   He's such a regular Mac break weekly
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.760]   that was it Dan Lutors made those jingles for us
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.040]   who made the jingles for us.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.400]   That was Jeff Smith.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.680]   Jeff Smith did it.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.720]   I think Don McAllister.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.320]   That's the one.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.240]   That's the one.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.480]   Yeah, I'm excited to be here today.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.360]   We've had an announcement about an announcement.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.400]   So we can still do some rampant speculation.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.320]   It will be next Tuesday, ladies and gentlemen, right?
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.840]   October 4.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.560]   And the invitations have gone out.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   Let's see a show of hands.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.560]   Those of us on the panel.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.360]   Since we are the royalty of Macintosh journalists,
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.320]   let's see a show of hands.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.360]   Those of you who received that invitation this morning.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.360]   You didn't even get one?
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.160]   I continue my unbroken streak of not once
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.440]   ever having been invited to the Apple campus.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.000]   Can I just point out?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.240]   Can I just point out that this is the most
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.040]   listened to Macintosh podcast by like a million?
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.360]   I mean, we between us, you write for the Chicago freakin'
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.560]   Sun times.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.280]   Don McAllister screen casts online.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.960]   You do nothing but talk about great Mac software.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.800]   This is the royalty.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.600]   And we've been stiffed again.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.320]   Speaking of stiff--
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   I think it has something to do with a Skype and a laptop.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.520]   You think you guys are tarred by my brush?
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.160]   I hope not.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.600]   I hope that's--
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.360]   My excuse is I'm so far away.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.520]   It's not worth the UTA.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.160]   Yeah, they would invite you to a UCA.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   So--
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.200]   Yeah, I mean, the other thing is I was a little bit--
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.280]   oh, she didn't get invited.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.400]   But then I realized that, well, yeah, when you found out
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.160]   that it was going to be in Cupertino, not even San Francisco,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.880]   last night I was on travel size figuring out that the move
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   to Cupertino added another $250 to the cost of the trip,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.680]   which meant that there's no way I could afford it to go.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.280]   Not that I couldn't have spent $850 for this announcement.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.080]   Well, the good news is you don't really
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.440]   need to go to the announcement.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.960]   In fact, because it's one infinite loop, which
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.480]   is a fairly small venue.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.880]   I think it's only maybe 200, 150 people.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.840]   It's about 2, 250.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.000]   The last Apple announcement was the iPod high-five announcement.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.320]   You and I were there with that.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.080]   We brought a whole network down on that one.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.000]   That wasn't the early days.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.480]   I got this call from Lipsen.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.640]   We were like, we had to turn you off last night.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.080]   But of course, Apple doesn't need the coverage from us.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.960]   So that's all right.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.240]   I understand.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.720]   I just wish-- here's the thing I don't mind
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.480]   that they don't invite us.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.120]   I wish they'd stream the damn thing
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.320]   so that we could sit in the comfort of our own studio
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.160]   and cover it.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.840]   We will.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.400]   We will be here covering it live.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.240]   Evidently streaming live is very difficult and very complicated.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.440]   And Apple just doesn't have that kind of technology available.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.400]   I don't think anybody does.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.040]   I don't think it's possible, frankly,
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.400]   to take something going on in a studio or in an auditorium
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.080]   and live, purvey it out over the internet
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.960]   so that people could watch it.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.480]   Someday.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   I don't think you could do that.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   Someday.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.000]   Someday.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   They will people ever be able to watch?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.880]   Live event streaming, they will.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   I have faith.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.880]   I have faith.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.480]   Actually, what's weird is they did it after I--
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.400]   so I bootleg did a little bit--
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.160]   was the iPad 1 announcement.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.840]   But even after that announcement, they did stream 1 live.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.360]   And then they stopped again.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.360]   You would think they would want to control the message.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.480]   I mean, they're going to have live bloggers there, CNN--
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.920]   What would I--
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.240]   And all those cameras are there.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.320]   And what they do is they record one tape, or like half an hour.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.520]   Then they pop it.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.000]   They carry it hand-cariote over.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.160]   And then they put it out on the air.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.640]   So it's almost live.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.760]   I think that the reason that they don't do it--
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.360]   And I don't know.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.320]   Case it big screw up.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.120]   --is that no, no, no, it's not a big screw up.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.120]   I think that the issue is is that if they livestream it,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.280]   it takes some of the powder away from the news agencies.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.320]   So the news agencies all have to race to get it up
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.920]   on as fast as they can.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.400]   So they're protecting streaming?
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   Well, they're creating competition.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.840]   It puts them all in even playing field
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.000]   so that they all have to try to get the news up.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.400]   They all have the chance of getting the news up.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.600]   And if they were streaming it live every single time,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.560]   I'm not sure if you would see the same blogging that goes on.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.800]   You wouldn't see-- a lot of the news that they get coverage for.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.200]   In addition to that, I can say that with the kind of demand
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.840]   that Apple has for their launches,
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.440]   if they had capacity for a million viewers,
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.880]   they'd get a million viewers.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.800]   And I think that that does turn into real money eventually.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.000]   It probably costs them a significant amount of money
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.360]   to do it.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.080]   All right.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.880]   Well, anyway, what we'll do is we'll be here.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   I don't know, Andy, would you join us?
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.320]   I'm going to be home on Tuesday.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.120]   So, yes, absolutely.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.960]   All right.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.320]   Don, would you like to join us?
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.120]   Yeah, there's a-- there's a London Mac user group
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.320]   meeting down in London that haven't especially
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.960]   went down there.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.840]   So I'm saying--
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.880]   Well, go to that.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.240]   And then we can call you there.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.320]   It'd be fun to see what the London contingent thinks.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.160]   Yeah, possibly.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.000]   That'd be fun.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.640]   Safe connection.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.760]   Will you be here next Tuesday?
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.280]   Of course.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.000]   Will you all be here next Tuesday?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   All right.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.400]   We'll just have our own live broadcast.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   We'll show them--
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   We'll show them.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.520]   We're like the nerds who are like, we're going to play D&D
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.520]   on prom night because we didn't want to go to the prom anyway.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:55.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.520]   I didn't want to go.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.800]   I didn't want to go.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.680]   So the invite is interesting because it's very clear.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.840]   Usually they're a little cagey around.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.960]   They aren't they in the invites.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.600]   This one's pretty obvious.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.600]   It says, let's talk iPhone.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.720]   Has four icons.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.360]   I think this is kind of clever.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.320]   Tuesday the 4th, 10 AM, that specific time.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.240]   They have a pin in the map at one infinite loop.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.400]   See, that's one infinite loop.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.120]   I see the loop.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.280]   And I love this that the phone icon has--
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.440]   there's one message waiting.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   One call.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.160]   I love that.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.200]   And you missed it.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.000]   You blew it.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.560]   That's the one.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.960]   That's the one that means Leo, you're not invited.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.000]   So--
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.560]   I thought the time--
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.960]   the stop line, let's talk iPhone.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.800]   That's kind of curious.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.320]   Why is it curious?
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.160]   Well, they could be saying, OK, let's talk about why we're
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.920]   not releasing an iPhone this year.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.760]   Or it's not--
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.800]   Let's talk iPad.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.000]   iPod, is it?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.480]   Turns out that now we can't do black phones either.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.920]   So it turns out that Samsung has an uncle who's very, very
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.640]   high up at the Fair Trade Commission.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.040]   And now we're not allowed to sell the iPhone until all
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.440]   litigation is closed.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.160]   This does look a lot--
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.400]   Well, and there's a lot to say.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.880]   There's a lot of movement on the IRC,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.480]   about talking about nuances, support, so the talk.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.640]   Yeah, that's the talk.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.920]   So if we're going to read the tea leaves, let's talk iPhone.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.440]   So is this--
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.880]   There's always a hidden message, isn't it?
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.600]   And I think it's--
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.960]   Now, who here show of hands cannot talk about iOS 5
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.080]   because they have signed the NDA?
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.600]   OK.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.520]   So you can go away.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.200]   We'll just turn here.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.120]   We'll talk.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.160]   We'll turn him around.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.720]   It's OK.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.360]   I got comics.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.560]   I'll read comics here.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.560]   I think I got comics.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.360]   Don't listen, Andy.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.160]   I read it.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.040]   Lots on the blog, so it's OK.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.520]   You're allowed to speak about anything that's already
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.200]   published.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.360]   Anything that's public knowledge is OK.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.360]   I just blanked out Andy.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.000]   There we go.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.560]   Whoops.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.080]   Uh-oh.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.640]   There.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.280]   So Andy, look, Andy's reading comicsology.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.600]   What's the hot comic out there?
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.440]   You reading those new DC reboots?
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.080]   They're all pretty awesome.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.320]   There's probably my favorite so far as gotta be action
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.560]   comics number one.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.080]   I know.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.360]   They have to get that.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.080]   They changed her.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.000]   They changed around Superman, but not enough to--
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.840]   enough to make him interesting, not enough that make you not
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.520]   recognize him as Superman.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.680]   What you just heard, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.320]   is a sample of Andy's new show on the 5x5 network,
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.920]   the Inoco Files, which debuted this week.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.800]   Congratulations.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.160]   Thank you.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.920]   I'm told to say top 10 podcast in the UK.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.800]   So apparently I have more--
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.400]   yep, exactly.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.640]   I have more of an EU sensibility.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.520]   Hopefully that-- I like Woody Allen.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.880]   But that's OK.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.160]   Not you, EU.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.160]   You.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   You.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   You.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.160]   Anyway, congratulations.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   That's great.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   I'm really pleased.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   Thanks.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.800]   There was people who were saying, well, why didn't Andy--
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.920]   why wasn't Twit doing it?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.120]   Andy approached us, and we already
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.680]   do kind of similar stuff with Tom Merritt.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.160]   And frankly, I think this is--
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.680]   you and Dan, Magic Benjamin, it's a match made in heaven.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.960]   And I was thrilled that you were going to do that.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.520]   And I got the same emails.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.560]   And again, it's a good opportunity
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.400]   to say that I don't have any sort of an exclusive arrangement
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.320]   with Twit, but I definitely wouldn't
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.560]   have gone forward with it unless I talk to you guys first.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.520]   You offered it for-- you offered it to us first.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.520]   Absolutely.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.920]   I think the world of all you guys.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   I love you too.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   And so believe me.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.160]   And in fact, a lot of people are kicking me right now for not
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.160]   doing it.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.280]   But that's OK, because we have a handshake agreement with Dan
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.680]   and so that once it comes time for contract renewal,
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.360]   if you could just pretend to have some money in the kitty.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.640]   The real deal is that I think we've
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.160]   learned through a bitter and hard experience
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.720]   that our audience really wants us to be very techy.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.880]   And I think that's a niche that we want to serve.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.440]   And there's plenty of room for other stuff.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.440]   And look, this is the beauty of podcasting.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.760]   And this is the perfect for me because the not go all
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.360]   when I get to talk about non-techy stuff, where it's like--
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.960]   so sometimes it's like, oh, I have nothing new to say
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.720]   about the iPhone 5, but I have to talk about the iPhone 5 now.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.320]   But there's a place where I can talk about bread machines,
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.640]   comic books, and the indefatability of Sheriff Lobo.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.480]   All this and much more.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.480]   All the 5 by 5.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.280]   So we're just going to stick with tech.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.680]   By the way, Snoop Dogg will be joining us a little later on.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   I'll just get it.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.360]   Apparently Snoop Dogg, I Justine, he's on what's trending
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.720]   or was just on what's trending.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.960]   Snoop Dogg is everywhere today.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.400]   This is Snoop Dogg Day on the internet.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.080]   And we missed that one, Minzel.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.760]   So I don't know what to say.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.320]   Hey, so back to the iPhone.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.440]   This interlude brought to you by the 5 by 5 network.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   Assistant, according to what I've read--
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.120]   and I am not in D8 on iOS 5.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.040]   I intentionally didn't sign the developer agreement.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.480]   Assistant is going to be--
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.160]   we've had that capability in Android phones for some time,
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.440]   where you press and hold the search button.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.600]   And then you can say, send text to Andy.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.280]   You son of a-- and it would go on like that.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.920]   And then you can also-- I love this feature.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.320]   If you have Spotify or RDO or a number of other music
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.080]   clients on here, you can say, listen to Bob Dylan forever
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.680]   and you can play it.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.080]   That's really amazing.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.520]   Because these are the kinds of things
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.560]   assistants now going to bring to the iPhone 5.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.880]   And the world will say, for the first time ever,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.600]   you could tell your phone what to do.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.000]   And given that if they're partnering with Nuance,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.960]   which it does look like-- I mean, this is really--
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.960]   Nuance does the best.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.720]   The best recognition.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.640]   And a lot of those commands are pretty easy, even
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.560]   in a poor environment to understand,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.320]   because if you're only grabbing out of them--
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.360]   if you only have to identify one of 600 words,
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.560]   it can do it with a lot of different assets.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   Much more accurate.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.240]   Much more accurate.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.080]   It gets complicated when you start talking about--
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.240]   Right.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.640]   You start--
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.720]   Well, I'll be absolutely comparing it to Android,
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.240]   because it is true that about half the time I say,
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.520]   send text to Alex message this.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.360]   And it will perhaps not put it in the right field.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   It'll send you a message that says, send text to Alex.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.280]   Things like that.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.120]   So it only works about half the time.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.440]   And when it works, it's amazing.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.640]   I'll be very interested in how--
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.840]   Nuance is the best, though, right?
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.920]   I mean, this is going to be the best recognition.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.680]   On Android, that's been one of my top features
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.520]   that I wish I would see on the iPhone,
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.280]   because even when I'm driving FMA to stop light,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.680]   I have absolutely no hesitation about reaching over,
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.960]   tapping the search button, and saying, navigate to Mexican
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.640]   food.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.200]   And three seconds later, it gives me which one of these three
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.040]   Mexican restaurants do you want?
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.440]   When you want, it says, confirms and you're done.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.920]   So it just works perfectly.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.200]   The articles I've read did say that that navigate to will be
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.400]   in the Assistant.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.600]   But what turn-by-turn directions will it use?
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.720]   Because the iPhone doesn't currently come with that.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.520]   Is Apple going to do its own GPS app built into the iPhone?
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.760]   They definitely could.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.680]   Everyone is actually contracting with, I think,
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.280]   I believe it's Navitech.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.640]   There's only two companies.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.520]   There's Navtech, and one was purchased by Nokia,
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.240]   and the other was purchased by Ericsson, I think.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.400]   So it's a shared library that--
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.560]   Well, and then there's Google.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.960]   And they could use the Google.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.760]   You know, Telenav, that's the other one.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.560]   Navtech was bought by Nokia, Telenav is the other one.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.760]   Although Andy and I both like this motion GPX drive.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.520]   Bushnet.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.960]   That is the best GPS app there.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.400]   I would love to see Apple license that or include that
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.440]   or somehow do that.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:18.920]   Absolutely.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.640]   I think it's the only iPhone nav app I've seen that actually
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.280]   behaves like an iPhone app and doesn't behave like a $79 drug
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.520]   store GPS interface.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.360]   It really is absolutely an iOS product.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.760]   So it has its own foibles, but I think
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.640]   that I would never choose any other stuff that one.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.880]   I have to admit, after testing a lot,
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.840]   I haven't tested that one.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.600]   So I tested a bunch of different ones.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.360]   And the ones that I found-- the only one that I did--
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.480]   there was a certain place in LA that I was trying to get to,
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.400]   that I have had to go a couple of times.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.000]   And the only one that got me there was Tom Tom.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.480]   Tom Tom.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.080]   You know, it was the only one that was accurate enough
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:51.960]   to actually get me there.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.360]   The rest of them I had to get close and then figure it out.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.960]   It was very remote, it was a very odd place in LA to get to.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.440]   Let's remember that when that SNAFU over privacy about Apple
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.080]   storing all of that Wi-Fi and location information
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.960]   and then keeping it on the phone forever,
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.880]   they did say that part of the reason they were doing that
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.120]   was for what traffic app, right?
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.400]   So they are crowdsource traffic.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.960]   So there is some reason to think that Apple might be,
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.320]   in fact, internally developing.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   I mean, traffic is typically something you put in an app, right?
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.440]   I mean, the thing that interests me, though,
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.840]   is back to the speech technology is whether or not
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.240]   it's only going to be limited to the new phone,
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.480]   whether or not they need the extra processing power
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.040]   and extra memory that might be in a new phone to actually do
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.440]   the real high-end speech recognition,
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.480]   or whether or not they're going to actually release it
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.920]   for older phones as well.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.800]   I'm not sure how they know, but according to 9 to 5 Mac,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.960]   it will only be in a new phone because it requires--
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.760]   and this is the other big scooplet, the 9 to 5 Mac had--
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.360]   it requires the dual-core A5 processor,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.920]   and there will be a gigabyte of RAM in the new phone,
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.120]   and it will require that.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.720]   That's the kind of thing you would put in
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.760]   for good speech recognition.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.600]   I remember for years that one of the drags on speech recognition
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.280]   was not having enough memory to store the vocabulary,
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.960]   it makes a big difference to be able to access
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.240]   that vocabulary quickly.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.640]   And the nuanced library is, I think,
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.920]   it's like a gigabyte or two.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.120]   So when you install the whole library, it's pretty hefty.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.720]   Also, correct me if I'm criffing it wrong,
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.000]   but doesn't Google speech recognition
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.320]   require a connection to the internet?
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.560]   It does.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.840]   So they're actually sending it up for processing
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.800]   and then sending the results back down.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.160]   Now, the nuanced dictation app for the--
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.920]   Dick was called Dictate on the iPhone.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.640]   And also, it was sending it out to servers.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.760]   But now, with the dual-core processor gigabyte of RAM,
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.320]   it may be possible that you could do it all.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.320]   And I think that's important.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.920]   I think that that was one of my activities
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.000]   that, while it's really fast, it was like,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.040]   I don't really feel like sending everything I want
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.880]   to the cloud to have it dictated.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.240]   I kind of want to keep it on my phone.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.040]   And I think there was some security issues.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.360]   I think a lot of us are still slowly moving
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.640]   into the cloud reality that nothing will be private.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.920]   Also, you were limited to the number--
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.440]   to the length of speech that you could have.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.640]   So if you were actually dictating,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.640]   you had to limit it to like 30 seconds or something.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.960]   As if it was all done well.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.320]   And that is a big problem with the Google dictation.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.840]   If you say something too long, it just gives the goes,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.000]   what, are you crazy?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   What is that?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.120]   And the thing is, is that there are definite markets
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.600]   for a lot of this stuff.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.280]   When I think of my father has a hard time typing anything.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.600]   You get these short kind of cryptic emails from him
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.000]   because he doesn't really type.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.600]   But he dictates all day.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.440]   He's a lawyer.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.280]   And he dictates--
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.120]   Oh interesting.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:34.960]   --he's been doing it for 30 years.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   And he does it perfectly.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.000]   You know what the periods and the commas and the capital.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.520]   Because he has someone that types that stuff up.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.520]   He's used to.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.000]   And so the thing is, is that I just really
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   can see someone like that getting
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.520]   home to one of these phones and being able to write entire screen
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.120]   plays on their phone.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.280]   You know, just kind of pushing through all that stuff.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.920]   It was a dark and stormy night.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.640]   Comma.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.160]   Comma.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.400]   Suddenly a shot right now.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.880]   What a period.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.640]   But what if your villain is Antoine Semicolon?
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   You either change his name or you're screwed.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.920]   Hey, that's why God invented global search and advice.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.600]   And I don't want to be an old vogue about this.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.360]   But every time I think of the one gigabyte thing,
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.160]   I just remember that I had to write a three page paper on it.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.520]   When I worked in Industrial Light and Magic on Star Wars,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.200]   I had to write a three page paper on why I needed to go from 128
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.560]   megs of RAM to a hundred and add 64 megabytes of RAM to my system
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.480]   because it would speed up my renders by a certain period.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.120]   And now my phone is coming with--
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.240]   A phone with a gigabyte of RAM is kind of stunning,
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:34.840]   if that's--
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.200]   When you really put that in perspective.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.160]   --of that dual core--
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.520]   I don't know if it's a gigahertz or 1.2 gigs.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.960]   I think this is a dual 1.2, this Samsung.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.080]   So I imagine 1.2.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.880]   That much RAM.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.360]   I mean, you're talking a powerful computer in people's pockets.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.080]   Thing is, though, it's not just the speech technology,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.040]   the speech recognition.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.120]   It's also the fact that it's Apple.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.360]   So they're going to take that speech recognition technology,
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.720]   which is highly advanced.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.840]   And then they're going to wrap the user experience around it
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.280]   and make it even more powerful.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.560]   So in effect, it's a bit of a double whammy, really.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.560]   You've got this really neat technology
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.280]   that is very accurate and can understand what you're saying.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.320]   But then to wrap the Apple user interface around it
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:20.280]   and the way they know how to make the user experience better,
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.680]   that just takes it to the next level.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.640]   And if they add, if they're able to add the LTE,
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.320]   I think that's kind of one of the big questions.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.560]   Wow, they're not going to.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.120]   Are they?
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.080]   Well--
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.120]   Andy, your opinion.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.080]   No chance.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.200]   Well, I was in Chicago a few days ago.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.520]   That was a rare opportunity for me
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.360]   to very furiously test out AT&T's LTE,
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.400]   because they're only rolling it out in two or three different
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.920]   cities, comparing contrast to Verizon's 4G coverage.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.320]   I was able to actually be on the internet on 4G
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.560]   while I was on Amtrak from Boston to New York this morning.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.160]   So with that huge disparity between 4G coverage
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.000]   and between the two major providers,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.480]   I don't think they're going to want to say, everybody,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.440]   buy your phones at Verizon, AT&T.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.520]   Fortunately, you still have those 1999 flip phones
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.680]   that you can hopefully make profit of,
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.560]   because no one's going to be buying your phones there.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.360]   Right.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.680]   So I don't know whether they'll do it or not.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.560]   I know that I talked to someone at a phone company,
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.720]   or a cell phone company, who said--
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.960]   this was quite a few months ago, three or four months ago,
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   that just said that the next version was screaming fast.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.600]   I mean, it was using their network.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.320]   So remember, AT&T did just put out--
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.920]   just announced LTE rollout.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.800]   It's in what, one market right now.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.720]   But AT&T's moving-- or two mark, whatever.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.160]   But they're moving as quickly as they can with that.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.760]   I have to admit, that's one of the things I'm really interested
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.160]   in with the-- because I'm going to get the galaxy this week,
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.520]   now that it's shipping, now that I've seen it.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.360]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.040]   I already saw it with Ileans, but I was waiting for it
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.640]   to show up.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.240]   Who are you going to get?
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.600]   I think I might get sprint.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.160]   I was going to Verizon, but a slightly bigger battery
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:02.720]   on the sprint one.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.840]   I'm going to sell you the sprint one.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.080]   It has an alert light.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.280]   Oh, she's showing it.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.800]   I like the unlimited.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.320]   I don't know what that actually means.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.760]   Yeah, I just--
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.840]   Because unlimited is not usually unlimited.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.480]   No, I just put my Facebook, my Twitter,
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.680]   and my Google account in there.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.440]   So now this is one of the things--
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.880]   here's the voice-- oh, this is interesting.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.240]   They have a little voice command widget.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.840]   So this is the first time I've ever used it,
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.800]   so we'll see what happens.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.360]   The only thing you're missing on the sprint is NFC.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.120]   AT&T and the mobile will have that.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.840]   We'll talk about NFC in a bit.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.120]   The CTO at Square says--
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.000]   They can't even get the QR codes to work.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.440]   Yeah, nobody's even using QR codes.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:45.720]   Email Alex, subject, yo-ho-ho, message.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.920]   This is Bop Hour by Vingo, which Alex, this Alex.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.280]   Yeah, let's use Gmail.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.840]   So you see, it's actually doing a pretty--
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.640]   yo-ho-ho.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.280]   It's doing a pretty good job of creating that message.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.760]   That's the kind of thing we're talking about.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.920]   The other thing that I'm sure Andy was on your list
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.320]   is the drop-down notifications that you have
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.360]   on the Android phone.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.560]   Having that on the new iPhone will really
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.360]   solve a lot of complaints people have had about the iPhone.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.160]   Yeah, definitely fix the notification system,
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.320]   because those cards just stack up and then you're kind of screwed.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.280]   I also don't like the fact that if you live in a state which
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.480]   you're not allowed to do any sort of text messaging,
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.480]   anytime a text message comes in with my iPhone in my car
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.000]   mount, it makes a sound.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.360]   The text message pops up.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.200]   I know that if I glance at that screen,
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.920]   I've just committed a $75 felony.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.040]   75, it's more than that.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.920]   What is the-- what is the--
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.200]   Lisa's gotten a ticket for this.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   What?
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:42.720]   What?
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.640]   Never mind.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.800]   She just told me--
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.840]   she said, mmm.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.360]   You know, communication between us is fantastic.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.560]   It's just one finger, and she told me immediately,
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.560]   all I needed to do.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.160]   You don't-- you remember what-- you didn't get the font.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.160]   I understand.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.600]   They let you off the hook.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.360]   But it was like-- it was a special day we had in California.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.880]   It was-- use your phone and get screwed.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.160]   But it was over $100, right?
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.680]   It was like $150.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.480]   $150, yeah.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.320]   It was very expensive.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.680]   So don't use your phone, folks.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.920]   Do not text and drag.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.040]   Now, here's something that's scaring the hell out of me.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.240]   Wedge Partners, an analyst named Brian Blair says,
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.080]   one phone, one phone only.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.640]   They will not introduce a second lower cost prepaid iPhone.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.160]   That's four.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160]   That's the best we've been talking about.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.160]   That's fine.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.160]   I don't care about that.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.520]   But will this-- he says the next generation iPhone will only be an incremental upgrade
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.800]   the iPhone 4, not a major design.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.160]   It will feature an A5 processor, higher resolution,
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.720]   A megapixel camera, possibly a larger screen.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.000]   But otherwise, the design will be very similar to the iPhone 4.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Do we credit that?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.720]   That's something different from what we've been hearing all this time.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.640]   There are some rumors that it's-- that they're having some trouble with the--
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   the cheaper--
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.640]   the five.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   The five.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   So this would really be the 4S.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.120]   But we'll see.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:10.240]   And I can believe that they would need the Gigabit memory for these new features.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.520]   So that might-- you know, be honest, if all they did was put an 8 megapixel camera of
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.640]   the same quality in and a Gigabyte memory in Ad iOS 5,
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.640]   I think it's--
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.640]   And then you have the voice recognition stuff?
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   Particularly if the voice recognition stuff doesn't work on the 4.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   Right.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   There's also the possibility that that went--
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.640]   Go ahead.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   Go ahead.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.080]   No, I was just going to say, I mean, you know, as an incremental update, that's fine.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   Just give me that.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.080]   That's great.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.000]   I'm not really that concerned about the actual design of the phone because the iPhone 4
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   design is great.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   But you know, that's what I'm looking for.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.280]   I'm looking for a slightly better camera, looking for more memory, faster phone, iOS
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   5.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.000]   And, you know, if the speech thing comes along as well, that's fantastic.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I just--
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   It has been a year and a half though.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I mean--
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   I-- I just-- the thing is as crazy as is that I used to have a phone that was like four
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   years old.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.480]   You know, like it was all beat out.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   There's no key of phone.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.160]   And it was like four years old.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.720]   And some of the keys didn't really work.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.000]   You had to kind of hit them twice.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And I kept on using that phone.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And now it's like, well, I've had this phone for--
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.680]   I mean, I've stopped taking care of this one because I'm like, well, it's an old, you
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   know, I don't have to think about it.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.040]   It's going to be a new one next week.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.680]   And it's crazy.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   What a scam.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.080]   Take-- we took-- this is a-- this is a perfect phone.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.080]   And it will be perfect until October 4th.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.080]   And then it'll be like--
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   Well, that's how Apple does it.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.080]   That's the brilliance.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.080]   How do they do that?
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.680]   Now, how can I do that?
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.760]   Apparently, according to the Electronista magazine, Apple is working on curved glass
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.920]   phones.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:44.720]   But it won't be-- just like the new Spaceship Apple headquarters, but it won't be till 2012.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.360]   Company has supposedly given parts suppliers help by buying glass polishing hardware.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.160]   This is according to the Digitimes.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.720]   Three companies have been identified as supplying cover glass, Fuji, Crystal, and Lens, focusing
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.040]   on iPhones, and GTAC handling iPads.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.040]   Curved glass.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   Mm.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.240]   I don't know if I really want curved glass.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.960]   Well, the idea is you would just-- you would just hook it on your head, and it would curve
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.040]   around, and you could just walk around like that.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.040]   I just-- you know what you think?
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.440]   It's just a matter of time before we have Borg phones that attach somehow a hat, a phone
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   hat.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.840]   I really think it's just going to be a transmitter that you just pop into the side of your head.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.840]   But body powered?
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.560]   You know, just body heat powered?
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.040]   Clearly this assistant, if they can make this thing good enough so that you could say,
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.760]   you know, dial Fred, send a message to Joe.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.840]   Apparently, one of the things assistant does, which sounds really cool, is it says, "I
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.120]   think you want to send a message to Alex saying this.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   Is that correct?"
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.120]   Then you can interact with it.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.120]   Yeah, that's the opposite.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.480]   If they get this down, that is sci-fi.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   That'll be awesome.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.560]   That's what I was going to point out about the difference between, I think, the Google's
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.400]   philosophy and Apple's philosophy.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.600]   Apple would not ship a product, if at any point you had to then take your finger and
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   actually tap something to confirm anything.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.600]   Right.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.560]   That's why that's the major difference.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.560]   Huge difference.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.880]   Oh, this is exciting.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.400]   We'll find out a week from today.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.120]   This is our last chance to speculate wildly.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.080]   I remember my wife just a couple weeks ago.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.760]   So should I get, do you think we should really have the kids use a real computer?
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.880]   Because they spend a lot of time on the iPad and I'm like, "That is a real computer."
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.600]   They're never going to know what it's like to have them.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.200]   We're going to tell them, "So we used to have to type on these things and it would
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:25.920]   like input the text and you know who said we'd all be using tablets by 2012?"
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   Bill Gates.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   Bill Gates.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   Bill Gates.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   He knew.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   He couldn't.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   He knew.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   Do anything about it.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.720]   Well, his mistake was thinking that he would be running Windows.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.960]   I keep looking through the archives to try to find a magazine ad that they were releasing
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.520]   in "Nightmare Soft" -- Microsoft when they released Microsoft Reader, their first attempt
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.560]   at an e-publishing format.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.000]   Had a timeline that they published in 1994 predicting that the buy -- I think it was
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.800]   by 2005, maybe 2008.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.120]   I remember one line specifically.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.400]   Paper books are only published for gift purposes.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.560]   And now every book that is actually meant to be read is published electronically.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:10.920]   And by 2005 or 2009, the last newspaper terminates print operations.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.920]   So --
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.920]   Okay.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   2005?
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   Damn.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.920]   We are living in a future which --
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.120]   No, no, we -- the "Chicago Sun Times" -- the other newspapers.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.160]   We just did so good on previous laps that we got like bonus time ads.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.720]   Extra, extra, fuse, extra.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.080]   Well, by 2001, we're supposed to be living on the moon.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   Come on.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.080]   We're still supposed to be living on the moon.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.040]   I don't know why we're not.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.880]   Something about moon dust being tiny and really sharp.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.920]   My original plan was to have this studio on the moon and then they told me I couldn't.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.560]   Actually, they told me I could but it would cost several orders.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.560]   It would cost a magnitude more money.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.560]   It's good.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.560]   But we could have floated --
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.560]   And there's that --
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.040]   And there's that oxygen problem.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.920]   I don't know what that means.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.280]   What else about this phone?
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:30:01.000]   T-Mobile says we are -- at least the chief marketing officer of T-Mobile, Cole Broadman,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.360]   said to T-Mobile staff, we're not getting the iPhone this year.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.040]   So T-Mobile's going all in on Android.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.960]   They're going to really push Android.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:17.400]   In fact, their new Galaxy to their Galaxy S2 uses their new HSPA+ faster network.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.400]   But we agree.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.400]   Sprint probably is getting it.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.880]   It seems to be that's the consensus.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   Yes.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.880]   Yes.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.400]   So Sprint AT&T and Verizon.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.680]   That's a pretty good lineup.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.760]   Of course, this guy also said he still believed that AT&T and T-Mobile would be merging.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.280]   So maybe he's just not the right guy.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.000]   That's good on them.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.320]   Apparently the San Francisco Police Department wants the surveillance video from the Tequila
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:45.800]   Bar, Kava22, where that purported iPhone 5 was lost.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.200]   So maybe the police still are doing this investigation.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.080]   Or maybe they're still doing the bidding of Apple's investigators, I'm not sure.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.120]   Or maybe they just saw Hot Chick and they want to find out who she was.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.200]   Or maybe there's just brilliant firewall marketing for Kava22.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.160]   They're far that nobody had heard of until this happened.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.000]   Somebody has asked us.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Somebody asked us for surveillance.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   They called.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   We thought they were the police.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.120]   I think an iPhone 6 was lost here in the Commexology Office.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.120]   Commexology.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.760]   Make a fine digital commix for you and yours.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.200]   You know, just can you just give up because in a week we're all going to know it doesn't
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   matter anymore.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.080]   And you look at, by the way, and this is going to be kind of interesting conversation, but
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.240]   you look at how much Amazon has let leak out about its Kindle.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.240]   We know the name.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   We know the price.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.240]   We know what it looks like.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   We know what's going to be on it.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.520]   The announcement probably tomorrow, which we will be covering live at 7 AM Pacific 10 AM
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.520]   Eastern.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.280]   And Andy, I hope you're going to be at the event.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.040]   So I hope you'll join us after the event.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.160]   But it doesn't sound like there are going to be any surprises.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.000]   We know everything that's going to happen.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.320]   Does that hurt Amazon?
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.240]   Should Amazon have done what Apple did and does and keep a tight lid on all of that stuff?
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.480]   Yeah, because I think you want to make sure that you want that people understand your
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.240]   motivations and your goals before people make their own decisions.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.000]   Because if people got with of this device and said, "Oh, look, it's just the Blackberry
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.160]   playbook," and it has a Kindle that big deal, we all hated the Blackberry playbook, if they
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.520]   did an Apple style, the first thing that people would hear about this would be that we wanted
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.920]   to produce a really, really superior version of the Kindle ebook reader.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.200]   We want to make a great ebook device that does nothing but run ebooks.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.480]   Of course, there's also web browser, but it's not intended to be a tablet device or a competitor
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.400]   for any other tablet and platform.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.800]   It's just the most awesome ebook reader connected to the largest ebook library ever.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.840]   And if that's the launching point for all the discussion, that's a big win.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.600]   If it's seen as a failed iPad competitor, which is not true and not fair, then that
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:50.800]   at least throws away a certain advantage they might have had by keeping the secrecy level
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.440]   a little bit higher.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.920]   They have taken some of the excitement out by the fact that we now know it looks--it's
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.920]   playbook.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.040]   It kind of takes a lot of the excitement out of it.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.440]   But I think that also it depends on your approach to your presentation.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.360]   Are you going to try to make sure that you answer all the questions that come up when
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.720]   people know about what's going on?
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.640]   So there's a lot of people talking about what's good, what's bad, the fact that it
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.680]   looks like a playbook or the fact that it's less expensive, all those other things.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.120]   So now they know that when they do the presentation, they can respond to those things, whereas
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.240]   Apple tends to be more of a, we're not really interested in responding to anything.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.080]   This is the way reality looks.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   This is the way reality looks.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.240]   And they're not that concerned about getting that early feedback as other companies might
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.240]   be.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.640]   It's a little less practical, but it's been working.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:39.320]   And the other thing I think the reason a lot of this leaked out is because Amazon gave
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:44.880]   copies of this Kindle Fire to developers months ago.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:51.120]   And by the way, magazine companies, according to Bloomberg or the journal, virtually every
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:56.320]   magazine companies agreed to do a version of the magazine for this new Kindle Fire.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.920]   So they kind of had it by giving it out.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.360]   Apple doesn't do that.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.160]   When they do that, we heard the story of how they lock it in the room and they put a wooden
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.840]   frame around and they take pictures of the wood grain.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.080]   And there's a collar that goes on.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.560]   There's got a small explosive on it.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.280]   And you will wear this collar until we announce the product.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:21.200]   You almost feel like Apple's gone to a, because almost a psychotic extreme.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.440]   The thing is, as well with the iPad, it's much more of a generalist device.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.360]   But with the Kindle Fire, it's a much more focused product.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.880]   It's much more niche product.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.200]   It looks as though it just will be a really great ebook reader with some applications,
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.320]   but certainly not the scope that the iPad has.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.480]   So in some respects, they don't have to manage it that closely because, you know, we all
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.400]   pretty much, even if we hadn't seen it, we all know it's going to be a color Kindle
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.200]   and it will, you know, it will do certain things very, very well.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:52.800]   But, you know, as Andy said, I don't think it's intended to be an iPad competitor.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.240]   It's meant to be, you know, a competitor or the ebook reader.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.400]   And then I'm not sure about it.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.760]   I think it's a media device.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:04.560]   And I think that what is interesting is that Amazon is actually leveraging media companies'
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:10.080]   fear of Apple and gone to them and said, "Hey, you know, you needed some competitor for Apple
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.920]   and we're going to, you should, you know, you should allow..."
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.120]   Because Amazon's a big retailer.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.560]   I mean, really what it really is is a portal to Amazon.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:22.760]   And everything Amazon does, books, magazines, you know, diapers, but also TV shows, movies,
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   and music.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.480]   I think that it's clear that the product that Amazon is targeting is actually the Barnes
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   and Noble Nook, which is also a $250 Android-based, a seven-inch color reader, which has been
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   having a lot of success.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.480]   They're coincidentally this morning when I picked up my Amtrak tickets, there was a
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.640]   Nook ad in the ticket folder.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.080]   The yesterday, last weekend, when I was flying home from Chicago, there were two ladies behind
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:55.280]   me on the plane sharing their Nook stuff and say, "Oh, boy, I really love my Nook and it's
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   probably isn't a great thing."
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.600]   As other family commercial back there.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.520]   And I think that they appreciate that their biggest advantage right now is the fact that
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.920]   they own the name Kindle.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.120]   Even when people have a Nook, they think of it as a version of a Kindle.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.800]   So if they can not only create something that leverages that brand, attacks into the most
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.960]   recognizable and respected e-book repository that has a commercial...
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:24.280]   ...titles, but also can undercut the Nooks price by a significant amount, there is no
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.720]   way that they lose in that scenario.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.760]   And they also set themselves up for a better and bigger and more ambitious tablet in 2012
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.360]   if that's really their goal.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.360]   One of the things that I find fascinating is to watch when you watch the difference between
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:40.720]   Netflix and Amazon and Apple and Google of how the media industry is trying desperately
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.400]   to keep them all even and not let anyone get ahead of the way Apple got.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.160]   And so they're now taking some stuff.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.360]   They're taking some way from Netflix and giving it to Amazon.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.360]   They're taking this away and they're trying to play the shell game.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.400]   The problem is that what's happening is all of them are building up and there's going
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.000]   to be a point where all these companies are bigger than they are.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.880]   These distributors, whether it's Amazon or if you look at their market caps now, each
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.720]   one of them is getting larger than the media companies that are trying to control them.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.800]   And it's just like these cats, they thought they were going to be kitty cats and they
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   turned out to be cycles.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   It's a holding action.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.400]   I think the media companies can't be so stupid that they don't realize that the end
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.520]   is not, this is all changing.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:23.160]   And I think it's just that this, somebody told me once, it's just, I think what's Corey
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.280]   Doctor has said, they know what's going to happen.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.720]   They just don't want it on their shift.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   They don't want it on their watch.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.080]   Well, I mean, he's putting it off as long as he's changed.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:33.320]   Well, you look at the impatience when Netflix started spending real money on TV shows when
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.480]   YouTube is talking about hundreds of millions of dollars for their own content.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.280]   When all these, what's happening, I'm surprised that Apple hasn't really dug into that yet.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.840]   But that's the kind of thing that when these companies all started digging into it, that's
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.040]   when things will accelerate to the ground much faster.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.720]   I love, I love Zilla, Zilla Girl in our chat room who said, it's just a magical Sears
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   Robot Cal walk.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   And I guess that's true.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.280]   I mean, if you're Amazon, that's a good way to think about it.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.120]   It's just a portal to our stuff.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.640]   We're going to take a break, come back with more of this big story about, in fact, a
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:10.040]   fascinating story about the Facebook, iPad app, some rumors, it might be announced finally
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.280]   October 4th on Tuesday, a week from today.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.680]   But before we do that, let me talk a little bit about our good friends at go to meeting
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.880]   the folks at Citrix, make the best web conferencing software out there.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.760]   It is the ultimate online meeting tool, works with anyone, anywhere you could share screens
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.920]   on a Mac or on a PC or from one platform to the other.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.080]   And now they have HD faces.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.120]   And I have to say this is exactly what they needed.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.840]   They're competing against products that cost so much money, tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.200]   This is $49 a month.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:48.280]   You get not only the built in VoIP conference calling, you get the screen sharing, very
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.760]   high speed, very effective.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.160]   You get high deaf video of your participants.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.560]   And it's so easy for your attendees to use.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.560]   It's so visual.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:04.640]   I mean, there's nothing like that nod or that frown, folded arms of the sales prospect
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:11.000]   or the happy smile of somebody you're talking to who's excited about what you're selling
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   them.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   It communicates.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.040]   And of course, seeing you is so important too.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.880]   I just really love what they've done.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.360]   When they first show me the HD faces on GoToMeeting, I was blown away.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.520]   The quality is so good.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.480]   It is easily the best video quality I've ever seen.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.000]   And now you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.440]   Just visit the website, GoToMeeting.com.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.600]   Promo code on this is Mac Break.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.760]   So when they ask you for an offer code, type Mac Break.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.200]   And you will get to try it for free for 30 days.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:47.440]   And it also works on the iPad, which is super cool to have these meetings on the iPad as
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.280]   well as on your desktop.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.280]   GoToMeeting.com.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.280]   We use this.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.960]   I use it probably three or four times a week.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.240]   We use because we have so many different clients.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.640]   We use pretty much all of these online aggregate ones.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.920]   Because they have their preference.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.320]   Our own is GoToMeeting, but the other ones are something else.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.880]   And you just get to these other ones and you're like, "Really?
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.880]   Really?
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.080]   You know, it's like, you know, it's definitely the way to go.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.080]   If you're looking for doing these meetings, GoToMeeting is."
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.800]   And we use GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   Love it.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   And GoToTraining, you see there.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   Tim, use that one.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.440]   I have used it.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:26.240]   GoToMeeting.com, offer code Mac Break, 30 days free on this.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.400]   And I think you will really like it.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:32.400]   We do thank them for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.200]   So I've even read in these stories about this Facebook app for the iPad.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.960]   And everybody's wondering, you know, what's the story?
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.680]   Why isn't there a Facebook app on the iPad?
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.880]   Mark Zuckerberg when asked that a few months ago at a meeting said, "Well, we don't think
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.520]   the iPad is a portable device."
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.520]   What?
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.280]   You think of it as a computer.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.280]   And it's true.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.600]   And it has a good enough browser that you can't get the full Facebook experience in Safari.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.440]   But the real truth is coming out because the guy who wrote the Facebook app quit.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:03.000]   It was ready in May and Facebook has been holding on to it.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.200]   And he finally went to Google.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.840]   He said, "I can't handle this anymore."
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.600]   So we're finding out a little bit more about this.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:14.160]   There is a rumor that it will be announced on Tuesday when the new iPhones are announced.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.960]   I'm not sure if that rumor makes sense completely.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.000]   But apparently a lot of behind the scenes negotiating going on between Facebook and Apple.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.400]   You remember when we saw our first bits of iOS 5, the Twitter integration was pretty
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.400]   obvious.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.400]   We didn't mention Facebook.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.960]   But Twitter was all integrated throughout iOS 5.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.960]   What do you think, Don?
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.920]   Do you think Facebook is going to have parity with Twitter and iOS 5?
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.240]   Do you think we'll be able to use Facebook the same way we're going to use Twitter in
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   the new iOS?
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:48.720]   I really don't know why there's been this trouble with the iPad app because I can't really
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.480]   see why they would hold it back.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.960]   It just seems like a negotiating chip, right?
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   Okay.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.440]   But as far as integration with the iOS, I'm sure Facebook would love that.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.520]   Whether or not they've missed the boat, I'm not too sure because the Twitter stuff is
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.720]   pretty well baked now.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.640]   So it would have to see if they could actually manage that.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   But as...
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   You're right.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   You're right.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.640]   You're probably too late to get it in there.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   You're right.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.440]   That's a good point.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:19.920]   What I had heard, I don't know if it's true, the rumor was that just before Ping was announced,
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.480]   like the day before Ping was announced, Ping was good.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.280]   As we know, it had Facebook integration when it was announced.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.920]   It didn't have it when it was shipped.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:32.240]   The story went that Mark Zuckerberg went to Steve Jobs and said, "Okay, great.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:38.600]   We'll merge together, except you have to give us all the personal information of all
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.600]   the people who use it."
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.160]   And Jobs didn't know why.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.280]   Remember, Jobs said it was an ownerist, something like it was an onerous demand that
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.280]   they made.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.480]   And I have a feeling that this negotiation is going on probably as we're speaking for
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:53.400]   next Tuesday about what will be announced, what kind of integration will there be in
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.560]   app.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.720]   And I think Apple, rightly so, is trying to keep Facebook from getting its fingers in
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.480]   Apple's customer database.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.640]   Yeah, Apple doesn't ever do that.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.560]   So if they do it, and that's actually happening, and I have to admit that I would much prefer
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.160]   Apple to have my personal information than Facebook, even though Facebook's already got
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.160]   most of it.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.480]   Apple, like giving them more access to that does not necessarily make me excited.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.520]   No, I agree.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.080]   I mean, after all, Apple doesn't sell our...
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   That's not how they make their money.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.480]   It's not by selling our information.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   Apple makes its money.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.280]   By selling great products, Facebook makes its money by selling our information.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.680]   So if you have the choice between the two and you want privacy, I think Apple's a better
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   bit.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   And I don't know.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.000]   I mean, I don't know if privacy is something I should continue to worry about.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.920]   I kind of feel like it's a battle that we're quickly losing.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.520]   Well, you know, our friend Jeff Jarvis just released his book, Public Parts, and he's
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.800]   been advocating the value of publicness.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.360]   And he'll be on a twig tomorrow.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.800]   We'll talk a little bit about public parts.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   I just got the books really great.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:59.360]   He does make that case that he says Mark Zuckerberg believes this and he believes it
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.120]   too that the more public you are, the happier you will be.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:09.160]   Facebook will be happier too, but my wife intensely avoided Facebook and everything
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.600]   else for, you know, until like three weeks ago.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.360]   And then she turned it on and she had 220 friends in like three days.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.760]   And you know, and now does she like it?
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.760]   She loves it.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.760]   And now it's like, she's like, Oh, she gets it.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.480]   And she's like, I'm on the edge of like, I'm kind of scared of Facebook and she's like,
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.480]   Oh, this is great.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.480]   And she's putting up all the, you know, this stuff.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:33.600]   And anyway, I think Apple's smart because the truth is a cell phone really knows a lot
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600]   about you.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.200]   He knows where you are and knows what you're doing is we do more and more stuff with our
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   cell phone.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.360]   This is the this is a marvelous day to collection wise.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.400]   And I think one of the things is that you have to get to a point.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.240]   I share a lot on Twitter and Facebook probably more than I should.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:54.480]   And but part of it is just it's a it's a muscle of me telling myself, you know, I'm not really
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.560]   hiding any of this anyway.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.960]   I think that I'm hiding it thinking that the government can't get ahold of exactly where
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:44:59.960]   I am.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.960]   If you're using the Facebook, you're telling them everything.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.680]   Well, but if you're but if you're also if you're walking around with your phone anytime
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:09.040]   anytime the FBI or CIA wants to know where you are, they can, you know, subpoena.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.200]   That's right.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.160]   You know, so that, you know, so the thing is subpoena, they need a pen register that basically
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.160]   asks.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.160]   I mean, yeah.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.080]   So the thing is, is that it's just, you know, the, you know, I think sometimes it's
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.760]   it's a muscle of just realizing that you're not in a private environment.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:26.360]   Almost that's the question is like, how much do you know about what's what you're doing
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.920]   where they're not doing?
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.920]   What noise means that I work at home, which means that I'm home at like two third in the
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.800]   afternoon, which means that there is a branch of marketing that believes that if I'm home
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.440]   watching basic cable at two thirty in the afternoon on a weekday, I am a total loser.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.640]   I will of course go sign up for an eighth mortgage on my house.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.160]   I will, you know, I will go for a slip and fall injury and I want to, I want to basically
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.240]   spend eighty thousand dollars training to be a dental hygienist.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   Now what happens?
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.920]   And so I don't get, you know, the sort of that's the, that's the, that's the, that's
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.080]   the marketers attitude.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.280]   My concern is that just by going around and doing my life, I'll be profiled to such an
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:08.480]   extent that, you know, I will never get to see ads for things that are actually interesting,
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.760]   that it will be nothing, nothing been inundated by ads or people will think, oh, well geez,
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.600]   he was at a comic book shop on a, every, he never shot.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:19.160]   He's got props on comic book shops after, after 7 p.m. on a weekday or, or on the weekends.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.640]   He's always, he must be looking for some way to get medical disabilities.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.240]   So we're going to target ads for that for him.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.400]   And we're going to make sure that if he ever tries to go for Carlone, we're never going
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.520]   to offer him like good terms because we're going to assume that he, that he basically
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.600]   knows nothing about finance and he'll take whatever deal we give him.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.120]   And that's the sort of information, that's the sort of thing that I fear about what happens
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.960]   when stupid marketers with half baked ideas about how to define people take dis-parrot
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:48.200]   information that really tells them nothing and tries to convince themselves as telling
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.720]   them exactly what they want to hear about a certain segment of the population.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.440]   I have no idea what happens, but I know I want no part of it.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.880]   Actually, it's exact, I think it's the exact opposite.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.960]   I think that what you're talking about, the imperfect targeting that television does, because
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.200]   it just based on the time of day is exactly what you won't get.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:09.240]   You're going to get ads that are directly, the more information they have about you and
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.440]   they would love to know exactly what you really like, not just where you are, but really,
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.560]   what are you doing there?
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.040]   So they can give you ads that you will enjoy because they will be targeted at what you
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   want.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.840]   I think that's exactly the offer and the reason there's going to be so much money, there's
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:28.880]   billions and billions of dollars spent on crappy TV ads based on the very little that
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.560]   they know about you because by virtue of the fact you're home at three in the afternoon,
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:38.680]   all of this money is just begging to be sucked away by Facebook and these smartphones with
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.680]   much more targeted advertising.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:47.200]   But if I can make one point just to that, my car insurance is really way wicked high.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.320]   I don't know what I'm saying.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.120]   I've never had an accident, never had a speeding ticket.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.280]   Not since day one of I've been driving.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   There's a get go.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.440]   So the insurance would like to meet you.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.440]   Exactly.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.520]   Well, that'll be the sponsor next week.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:04.520]   But what I'm saying is that and they have access to my full driving record.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.000]   So they can say, my God, this guy never files a claim.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.880]   We should be given, we should give him a policy for like $30 a year.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:13.000]   We'll clear $30 worth of profit.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.640]   But because they can sort of say, well, he's self-employed and self-employed people are
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:17.800]   in a high risk group.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.240]   So therefore, we're not going to offer him low cost insurance on that basis.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:25.320]   I think that that's exactly the sort of thing that will happen as they get access to more
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:29.600]   information that will find more reasons to make sure that the flow of money, the flow
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.080]   of services gets narrower and the flow of money out goes greater.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.560]   I'm very little.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.640]   I think when I look at it depends on how much data they have.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.240]   I buy everything on Amazon.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.160]   Like pretty much basically the first thing I have is I'm going to buy something and if
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.120]   it's not first I check is it on Amazon Prime?
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.120]   Check Amazon.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.120]   Is it on Amazon Prime?
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.120]   And if it's on Amazon Prime then the search ends.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.120]   Yes.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.120]   Like I don't go to the store.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   I don't go to anything else because I know it'll be here tomorrow for $3.99.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.600]   And I buy my time.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.240]   And so I buy everything there.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.560]   And now when I go up to Amazon the front page is like catnip.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.240]   I mean it's just like, you know, I just sit there and go, "Oh, whoa."
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.600]   You know, like they've gotten, because I buy everything, I buy Campbell Soup on Amazon.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.280]   And so the thing is is that they know everything about my buying habits from the kind of tools
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.040]   I get to the whatever.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.680]   And what's amazing is is that now I just have to almost avoid the front page because
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.760]   it's just like I look at it and go, "Oh, that would be really nice."
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.080]   And they really have it down.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.280]   So as they get more of the buying information in one place, I have to admit that it's expensive
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.800]   for me, but it's not that they're giving me the wrong thing.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:33.400]   They're definitely hitting...
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.920]   Is the train going through your comics store?
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.280]   Yes, it's soup on Amazon.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.960]   You know, you can buy soup on Amazon.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.960]   That's all I want to say.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.560]   Why would you buy soup is mostly water?
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.560]   What?
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   Because it's free.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   In two days I can have it for free.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.760]   I don't buy one tea and I buy like a whole bunch of them, but then it's not.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:55.560]   The other day I need a new outdoor garbage can and I thought of buying it from Amazon
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.240]   only because the shipping would be free and I just wanted to deliver the largest thing
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.160]   I've ever had delivered in my life.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:06.000]   I had a wait set delivered to me overnight.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.880]   That's just crazy.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   Just to see if they could.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.720]   It was 300 pounds of iron.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.040]   Delivered to be in get.
[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.040]   For $3.99.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.760]   That's $1.99.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.280]   I am not the prime customer that you would.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.280]   That's really...
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   You don't want you.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.440]   But I've had small refrigerators.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.560]   I just think that...
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.040]   I think a lot of this...
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.640]   I see what you're saying, Annie, about...
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   You're not getting your value out of your insurance, but it's partly because they don't
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   know enough about you.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.600]   They think that your freelancer is sufficient.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.280]   If they knew enough, they need more information, not less information.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:42.000]   But again, isn't it true that...
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Again, they can.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.880]   I believe they can look at my full driving history.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:49.240]   I think that's one of the things that you check off in the box when you ask to get insurance.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.640]   Who do you have in your insurance loan?
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.320]   Let's call them out.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.320]   Who are these?
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.320]   Rhett.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.400]   It's slippery mutual.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.400]   Who are we?
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.600]   Who are we from the calling now?
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.600]   I'm just waiting.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   Yeah, maybe they'll call.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:08.440]   No, I'm expecting that gecko to show up any minute now.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.240]   You probably don't have the gecko on a great business.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.960]   He's got this bad English accent.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.480]   I think he's Michael Caine.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   Or the progressive girl.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.480]   Or the progressive girl.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.480]   Or the...
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.920]   This is the other thing that confused me about Gecko.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.480]   They have like five different campaigns.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.480]   And they all are funny.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   They're all funny.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   But they're not related.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   There's the caveman and the gecko.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.120]   It's like, "Well, if you don't like the gecko, maybe you'll like the caveman."
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.120]   And it's true.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   I like both of them.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.120]   But the problem is...
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.120]   But I have USA, so it's kind of like your...
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.120]   We watched two of my minds.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.120]   That's the answer to that one.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.400]   They must think of a more credit risk.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.560]   They're not letting me see the white golfer commercial.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.560]   Aha.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.560]   I just...
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.560]   I think that...
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.160]   What next is I talking to my broker on here?
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.520]   I recommend a Gecko insurance.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.560]   Advertisers in general want to only advertise...
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.080]   You know, it's the old sales adage.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.400]   Straight from David Mamet, Glenn Gary Glenn Ross.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.960]   Only sell to people who are buying.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   Right?
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:51:59.960]   Right?
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.960]   It doesn't make sense to sell to somebody who's not going to buy your product.
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:02.960]   It's a waste to...
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:03.960]   It's wasted ad dollars.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:07.040]   So that's the more efficient, more targeted they can be.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.400]   The happier they will be.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.960]   Now, I don't know you're right.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:14.160]   I mean, if they see that you're eating donuts, you may not be able to get health care.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.960]   But that's a separate issue.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.080]   Certainly a major privacy issue.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.280]   Absolutely a major privacy issue.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:25.320]   I think it's not only a matter of time before people like me, whoever are slightly short
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:30.120]   for our weight, are going to have a hard time getting health insurance.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.120]   Things like that.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.200]   It's going to be more and more difficult.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.000]   I don't want them to see my wood orders.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   They're going to be like this.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.400]   I'm a sucker born every matter.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.600]   You know, they actually do that in Mexico on the beaches.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.600]   I'm convinced.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.320]   So, you know, if you ever go to the beach in Mexico, the only thing that Mexico is wonderful,
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.640]   the only thing that makes the beach not so fun is they have vendors like harass you constantly.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.200]   But the first guy who comes around makes a hat.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.200]   It's like a hat made out of palm leaves.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.200]   And he's...
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.080]   You know, it's like a couple of bucks.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.080]   And my wife bought it.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:05.080]   And I said, "Honey, you just bought the sucker hat."
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:11.680]   Now everybody who comes by sees you in that hat and goes, "We've identified the sucker!"
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.280]   And I think that's what they do with woot.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.280]   That's what woots all about.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.760]   I bought a USB powered Nerf missile launcher.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   How much did you spend on a woot?
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.760]   Oh, we got it.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.760]   We got a live one.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   You're wearing the sucker hat.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.760]   It was awesome though.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   It was pretty cool.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.760]   We still have that sucker hat.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.760]   I told him I turned out to be a pretty good hat.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.560]   It was a nice hat.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.080]   It's a pith helmet made out of palm fronds.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:32.920]   I think that would be quite nice.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   It's a sucker hat.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.920]   All right.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.920]   We're going to...
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.920]   Anyway, do we...
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:42.640]   We'll wrap this thing up with the discussion up with the vote.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.800]   Will we see a Facebook app for the iPad on Tuesday?
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.200]   Andy and I'll go.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.360]   I don't see why not.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.560]   I don't see why.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.880]   Why would Apple want to promote Facebook and anything like that?
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.880]   I agree.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.880]   I think we will absolutely not.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.560]   In a million years will we see that.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.440]   I don't even know why people were writing that.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.040]   Don McAllister, you agree?
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.840]   Yeah, we won't see.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.880]   I think with Facebook though, is it?
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.640]   This thing with Spotify has really annoyed me recently.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.640]   I think...
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.200]   Oh, man.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.760]   But they seem to be getting too big.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.040]   Are they doing that in Britain too?
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:20.520]   Because in the States, you cannot have a Spotify account unless you log in with your Facebook
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:21.520]   account.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.520]   Well, this is for new accounts.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.680]   If you've already got an existing Spotify account, you're okay.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.400]   But now, prerequisite is that you must sign up with a Facebook account.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:32.080]   And my Twitter stream has been on fire with people complaining about it and seeing it's
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   such a bad idea.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.320]   And if it goes down that route, I don't think it's a good move.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:42.040]   It's the last piece of the puzzle was Facebook collects all this information, but always
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.200]   says, "Well, it's voluntary.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.840]   You don't have to participate.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   You don't have to do it.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.200]   You don't have to have a Facebook account.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.520]   Only do if you're comfortable with it."
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.440]   And then they coerce you by making...
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:55.160]   You won't be able to buy groceries without a Facebook account.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.160]   You don't have to do it.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.160]   You could starve.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   It's okay.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.360]   I completely agree with you, Don.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.520]   This is appalling.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.040]   And I'm sure Spotify did it because Facebook's given them money, right?
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.240]   Well, it's 800 million users, right?
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.080]   But they're requiring it.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.360]   I know, but I'm saying that.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.920]   But if you're giving a special access, you think to the users?
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   Well, you're getting promotion.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.040]   I mean, you're getting promotion from Facebook.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.600]   Well, promotion equals money.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.760]   So yeah, so there, I don't think Facebook means they give them money.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:28.200]   I think that it's just access to 800 million users and promotion into 800 million users
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.720]   if you give us an exclusive relationship.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.400]   I mean, I don't think...
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.640]   That's a pretty big carrot.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.560]   No, it's a huge carrot.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.560]   And that's the...
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.640]   And I think that it's good...
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.880]   I think a lot of this is good for Google+.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.880]   You know, I think that...
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.880]   They're taking off, too.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:46.320]   1,269% increase in users over the last week.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.480]   And I'm kind of amazed.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.640]   I haven't posted very often twice.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.640]   I posted...
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.640]   That's not very often.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.520]   I look 7,700 people that have put me in their circle and I haven't actually done anything.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.840]   Although I did post a movie and it turned out great.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.840]   It was actually a great experience.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:04.840]   I was like, I should do this more often.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   We did a...
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.240]   I shot a movie a couple of years ago and I finally posted it on YouTube.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.560]   And the whole experience was so good that I was like, okay, so...
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.360]   I'm gonna have to do this more often.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.360]   It's actually a great...
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   I have huge engagements.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.360]   It's refreshing.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.360]   It's really...
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.240]   You get even more engagement from Facebook.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.880]   And I think that this is where the battleground is gonna lie.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:28.400]   And you know how Facebook coars to Spotify with 800 million users?
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:33.320]   They coars each and every one of us because it's hugely valuable to be on Facebook.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.480]   And if you are selling anything.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   And I'm putting...
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   We're putting the...
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.640]   We finally got around to setting up the page so that you can go to Facebook.com/pixelcore.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.520]   You know, like I did all those little things to make sure that...
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.480]   And I just feel like this is something we have to do.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   I mean, we have to make sure that we start...
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.640]   We start posting that stuff and we have to make sure people are following us.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:56.440]   And it's just part of business that you have to kind of pay attention to that stuff.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.120]   I like this.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:04.600]   This is a high school detention note is Jacob will be detained after school on 922 for the
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.600]   following reason.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:12.080]   Taking off shirt in middle of class and yelling, "Come at me, bro!" at another student.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.080]   That's...
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.080]   What was that?
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.080]   I don't know.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.440]   Google+ just distracted me big time.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.440]   That is awesome.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:23.920]   Why didn't I ever think of doing that?
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.240]   "Come at me, bro!"
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.160]   "Alright, I'm going to do that at the end of the show.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.560]   Just a word of warning to all of you.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.440]   We're going to take a break and come back with more Dama Calistors here.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.840]   Screencasts online.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.480]   What a great site that is if you want to learn how to use anything.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.120]   Max software particularly, but anything.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   He's got it all.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.520]   He's got it going on.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.580]   From the Pixelcore, Mr. Alex Lindsey, course.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:50.580]   Go to core.com.
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:55.580]   Great place to go to learn how to use media tools.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:56.580]   Wonderful stuff.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.580]   Great trainings.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.580]   Every Thursday now you're doing the live shows.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:00.740]   By the way, we just posted on YouTube.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:04.580]   We posted a two hour discussion about the new Final Cut.
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:05.580]   Oh, I'm going to see this.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:12.580]   It's posted now where we had two of the top trainers in the world who have gotten a chance
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.580]   to look at it and give us their feedback and show some of the stuff that's new.
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:19.580]   Okay, Facebook.com/pixelcore.com.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:25.580]   Just search pixelcore on YouTube and you'll get it easier.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.580]   And pixelcore.tv for your shows too.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:28.580]   You do a lot of great shows.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.580]   And pixelcore.com/live on Thursdays.
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:36.580]   Thursday nights we're doing, we have Derek Story talking about funding this Thursday.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.580]   Great photographer.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.580]   That's fun.
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:42.980]   And anyway, if you go to pixelcore.com right now you'll see Brent By on the cover, on the
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:44.980]   front page, on the cover, on the front page.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.980]   Brent is doing a production class.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:47.980]   I'm excited.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:49.980]   He's a guy who did all our lighting in here.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:51.980]   Our cameras are set up and everything.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.980]   This guy's amazing.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:53.980]   I really love Brent.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.980]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:58.980]   So that's, and we actually have a, I don't know why we're talking about this right now.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.980]   But anyways, if you go to, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you, if you
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.980]   match your plug time, I used to leave the plugs to the end and I figured, oh, they're just
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:04.980]   going to skip them.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:05.980]   So I put them in the middle now.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.980]   So Mac, Mac, break Brent is the, is your code to get $150 off the trainings.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.980]   It's going to be three days with Brent By talking about hands on production.
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:14.980]   I'm, I'm working.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:17.980]   Yeah, it's, it's going to be, I'm, I'm taking the class.
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.980]   We, we pay, we have consulting, uh, contract with him every, every month.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:21.980]   He did all of this stuff.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.980]   I mean, it's, it's really, and, and so he is, yeah, it's, it's going to be awesome.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:26.980]   $150 off.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:27.980]   It's normally $950.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.980]   Three hard, hard core days of production.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.980]   So if you're really interested, check it out.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:36.980]   And Andy, not co-course at the Chicago Sun Times, his website, CWOB.com.
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.980]   You'll be back tomorrow joining us for our live coverage of the Amazon announcement.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:46.980]   Uh, I guess he announced it was at 10 a.m. if you, uh, eastern time, if you want to join us,
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.980]   we won't be here that early.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:49.980]   So maybe join us after.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:50.980]   [laughter]
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.980]   Cause it's, it's at seven our time in the morning.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:58.980]   And, uh, so maybe, uh, we'll talk to you after the thing.
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.980]   Not before, I was thinking about before, but that'll be like 6.30.
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:02.980]   I'm not doing it.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.980]   Are you excited?
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:05.980]   It should be fun.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.980]   I, I hope they actually have product to actually start to play with because even if it's just,
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:17.660]   uh, a call, even if it's just a host organism for Kindle, color Kindle app, it will still
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.980]   be pretty good if it's, uh, cheap enough.
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:25.740]   So one of the things that's coming to Petaluma, and I miss this every year is the Macintosh
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.740]   Expo.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.740]   Now, I think a lot of.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.260]   I think it's a Petaluma or is that, um, north, the north, or is that in Santa Rosa?
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.260]   It's here.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.260]   Wow.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.260]   It's here.
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:35.260]   It's, um, uh, not, that's Macworld.
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.260]   Let me look at it.
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.380]   It's, it's kind of like a mini Mac world.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:43.100]   It's the Mac computer expo that the north coast Macintosh users group puts on.
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.740]   Um, it's kind of within Santa Rosa.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.740]   Maybe it is.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:47.740]   Okay.
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.740]   You used to do it here.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.740]   Petaluma community center.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:50.740]   I believe that's here.
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.740]   Mm.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.460]   Free admission, free parking.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.700]   And if you're interested, it's coming up this Saturday.
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:01:02.220]   Uh, and the reason I mention it, um, is because, uh, not only will a lot of great people be
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:07.460]   there speaking, including Bert Monroix, they're going to have, uh, his Times Square on display,
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.660]   a hard drive recycling event and a whole lot more.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.100]   You can read all about it.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.540]   But you see who's sponsoring this here?
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:18.260]   A lot of the great people who sponsor us, including smile software.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.140]   In fact, Gene McDonald's going to be at the event.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.580]   I'm having dinner with her on Friday.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.580]   I'm so excited.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.500]   I can't go to the event because I do a radio show right in the middle of that.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.380]   Unfortunately, I'm going to have to go.
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.380]   You should go.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.060]   Well, you go on on behalf and represent.
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.060]   I love these little Mac events.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.060]   There's, you know, I guess, hey, and this North Coast one is really good.
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:39.660]   I've been to it in the past and it's really a, uh, uh, it's a great event because it's
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.780]   just much more personal.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.540]   You can really, it doesn't feel as big.
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.740]   And if you're looking for something in between Mac worlds, uh, this is great.
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.740]   Jeff Carlson, Chris Breen will be there.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:51.580]   Brian Chafen, Adam Christensen, uh, Ted Landau.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:52.940]   Of course, there's Gene.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.100]   There's Bert.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.660]   It's really a great bunch of people.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:59.900]   Jason Snell from Mac world magazine will be there.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.500]   David Sparks, uh, MacSparky.com Derek story.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.580]   That's probably why Derek's, uh, going to be here for you.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.580]   He's local.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.580]   Well, that's right.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:09.580]   He's just up the road a bit.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:13.980]   Anyway, um, reason I mentioned that is I want to, uh, tell you all about text expander.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:22.740]   If you go to a smile software's website, smile software.com/macbreak, you could find out all
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:27.420]   you need to know about absolutely the best software on the Mac.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.660]   I couldn't live without it.
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:32.620]   In fact, I think it says right here the single best productivity tool for the Mac right after
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.620]   Quicksilver.
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:34.860]   Some of them Leo said that.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.660]   Don McAllister's got a screencast on this site too about how to use it.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:40.860]   Um, if you, I use it all the time.
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:43.260]   I've got it right up here in my menu bar.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.620]   See text expander.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:47.740]   What it does is as you type it's, it, uh, it watches what you're typing.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:52.940]   It's still correct spelling, which is kind of handy, but it also will insert snippets
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.300]   and they've got all sorts of variables and pauses and all sorts of things, which really
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.780]   is fantastic.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.420]   Um, text expander is just a must have tool on the Macintosh.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.700]   I want you to give it a try.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.340]   You can create text and or graphic snippets.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.940]   Anything that you type more than once or paste more than once.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:10.900]   I do stuff like my address, you know, it was like, right?
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:11.900]   Signature.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.900]   Someone says, can you, what address should we send it to?
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.380]   I just go this, you know, I have a little short, short hand and boom.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:16.380]   The whole thing pops up.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.180]   It's what they, what lawyers, you just call boilerplate.
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.260]   It's the stuff that you do all the time.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.980]   Now in text expander three, they've got these fill in snippets.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:28.980]   So it's basically a form and it will pull variable information and like time, date and
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.780]   whatever and put it in.
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:36.440]   You can add tabs, returns, enters or escapes in your snippet, uh, apple script and shell
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.500]   script completely supported.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.660]   Uh, so you can say, this is so cool.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:45.300]   You can say in the snippet, call this script and insert the result of this apple script
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.300]   after this shell script into the tab.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.180]   I mean, you could just imagine the valuable stuff you could do with this.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.860]   Uh, and of course it supports Dropbox.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.180]   In fact, that's where I keep my snippets.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.140]   I keep them on Dropbox.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:59.460]   So my snippets are the same on all of my max.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.980]   There's a free demo waiting for you.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.900]   Smile software.com/macbreak.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.820]   It's only $35.
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:10.300]   I would buy it, but, but if you want to try, go ahead try it first, but I would buy it.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.300]   And you can buy it.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.860]   There's also the, uh, go ahead, Don.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.860]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.740]   There's also TechTec's Panda Touch, which is, uh, on your iPad and your iPhone.
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.740]   You, great.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.740]   I mean, you like this one.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   Alex was just about to say.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.740]   On the, on the new versions, you can actually synchronize your snippets between all your
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.060]   devices, not just your Mac now.
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:29.940]   So it used to be a little bit torture was to, to move them across to the iOS devices, but
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.740]   that seems now it, uh, it actually does it automatically for you.
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.340]   So, and lots and lots of apps.
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:39.940]   Um, they've got a free API that develops and used to iOS apps so they can integrate TechTec
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:44.940]   to support into those apps.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:05:06.340]   And I think it's well over a hundred apps now on iOS that support TechS
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:11.340]   app.
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:16.340]   I just, I can't imagine why you wouldn't want this.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.340]   This is the best thing you ever had on your Mac.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.340]   In fact, it drives me crazy cause there's nothing quite as good as this on the PC.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:25.340]   I use something called auto hotkey, but it's just not as good.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:26.340]   Buy it.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.340]   Buy it.
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.340]   TechSX pander.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.340]   Buy it.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.340]   Smile software.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.340]  com/MacBreak.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:34.340]   And, uh, G. McDonald's actually, Gene and Adam Christensen, uh, are going to be at the radio,
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.340]   Sunday.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.340]   So we'll say hi to them.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.340]   Uh, then they're going to be in town for that great event.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.180]   I'd like Gene.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.660]   She's really a stalwart of the Macintosh community.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.580]   They always throw great parties and they support, uh, they support us.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.620]   They support a lot of Mac podcasts.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.820]   So you know, support them.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:57.900]   Uh, moving along to another story, let me just check our rundown here.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.940]   This was a big story.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:03.300]   In fact, they asked me, I do a radio show, a newscast every, uh, every Tuesday morning
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.740]   for KGO here in San Francisco.
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.260]   And they said, oh, breathlessly.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:10.900]   Oh, because Apple stock price tumbled yesterday, like three or four percent.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.860]   Oh, iPad supply chain orders down 25 percent.
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:21.380]   JP Morgan says people that, uh, Apple's soft on iPad sales.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.380]   I said, well, what?
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.380]   Well, what?
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:29.220]   I looked into it and, uh, you know, other analysts are, uh, including Gene Munster are
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.060]   saying no.
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.180]   They said perhaps this has to do with the fact that Apple's moving some of its production
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:41.460]   in Brazil, but nobody has any indication that, uh, there'll be a 25 percent reduction in
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.540]   fourth quarter iPad orders.
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:45.540]   Doesn't make sense.
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.540]   Anybody think so?
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.380]   No, not really.
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:55.540]   Um, JP Morgan Chase said Apple's cutting orders to vendors in the supply chain for its
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.940]   iPad tablet computer move them a result in slower sales for companies, including Han
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:06.980]   High precision industry on high, one of the big vendors for Han High.
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:12.660]   The cut could be to drop to 13 million units from 17 million units in the fourth quarter.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:22.020]   Um, however, they're not lowering their projection of sales, uh, of 10.9 to 12 minute million
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:26.900]   iPad sales in the fourth quarter, but maybe they say this reflects weakening demand in
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.740]   Europe doing due to economic conditions.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.220]   It could also mean that something new is on the horizon.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:38.380]   Oh, you're slowing, you're slowing things down to reduce inventory because iPad three is
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.380]   on the way.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:40.380]   I'm basing.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.020]   I mean, I'm just totally guessing on that one.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.700]   People have the, the rumor has not gone away that there will be an iPad announcement on,
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.700]   on Tuesday.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.860]   Oh, I don't know about that.
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:48.860]   Really?
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:49.860]   I think that would be, that would be too quick.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.860]   I think, I think we're still looking at the spring, but I, I could see that they could,
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:58.940]   you know, what you're ordering now would be affecting spring supply, not false or blind.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:03.180]   That would be the only reason that Facebook would announce an app is if there were an iPad
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.180]   announcement.
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.180]   That's why I don't think they'll do it.
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.180]   This is, this is an iPhone.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:10.060]   Although imagine Facebook on a large Apple 50 inch TV.
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:11.580]   You think the TV?
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:12.580]   You think the TV?
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.580]   I'm still, I'm still waiting for that.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.580]   The, the, the, the, the, the sit back experience.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:22.420]   It's a dream, dream on Comcast speaking of TV is working on an iPad TV streaming service
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.940]   called any play according to Mac rumors.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:30.180]   They will compete with cable vision and time Warner, which apparently have something similar.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:33.340]   Any play allows Comcast subscribers to view live television.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:37.100]   Why did I say live live television on their iPad?
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.780]   The past we've had video on demand with the XFINITY product, but this would be live TV.
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:42.780]   Well, the right TV was doing that too.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:46.020]   The right TV was doing a live supply as well.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:49.700]   Won't work on a Wi-Fi from other locations or via 3G.
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:54.020]   You have to be apparently, see this is why it's stupid.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.580]   You have to be near your Motorola set top box.
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:02.620]   Which will then send the stream to your iPad.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.820]   I think that's dorky.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:09.100]   See now, if they would do it over an internet connection like time Warner does, then you
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.100]   could really be a cord cutter.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.600]   Well, I guess you can't because you still need Comcast.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.080]   We need a sonic to have fiber in pedal.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.060]   A sonic net, which is a local internet service provider.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.060]   Actually, not that local.
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.420]   You know, we're going to get the fiber.
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:25.380]   They're placing on offering local TV over there.
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.300]   When are we going to get the fiber?
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:30.120]   We're getting fiber in this building.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.760]   Comcast is putting it in.
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.360]   We signed a three year deal.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.360]   We need more bandwidth.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.080]   We need more monkeys.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:43.160]   So we're getting more bandwidths by making a three year deal with Comcast for 100 megabit
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.120]   symmetric.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.120]   You didn't know that?
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.120]   You can get a strand.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120]   Do you want a strand?
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.120]   I want a strand.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.120]   I'm going to strand.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.120]   Well, let's talk about it.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.120]   No, I thought that we talked to you.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120]   Maybe we talked to Chris or something.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.120]   But anyway, you know, we don't, they don't talk to him.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.360]   It's like, every time we talk to him, they say, he's not going to talk to Alex talk to
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.360]   the money people.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.440]   Don't talk to Alex.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   He just runs the place.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440]   He's crazy.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440]   It's like me.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.440]   If people want to do something with Twitter, they don't talk to Leo.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440]   Talk to, talk to Lisa.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440]   She runs the place.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.280]   So anyway, yeah, we're getting fiber in here because we need the bandwidth and it will
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.280]   be from Comcast.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.520]   But that's because we have another big pipe from Sonic and we wanted redundancy.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.880]   We didn't want to be dependent on any.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.760]   We have the other opposite has Comcast and this opposite of Sonic because we, same thing.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.480]   Who cares about an iPad streaming?
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:28.800]   Now that I read this, iPad streaming that requires you to be sitting within hailing distance
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.080]   of your Motorola set top box.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.680]   What the hell is the point of that?
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.840]   Unless it's really for an Apple TV.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.480]   Oh.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.320]   Dun, dun, dun.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   I'm telling you.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.320]   It's all about the TV.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.320]   Apple applied.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.680]   Yeah, there's no TV.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:52.000]   Dream on Apple applied for it.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.200]   Dramatic podcast.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.200]   Do that again.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.200]   That was good.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.200]   All right.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.200]   All right.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.200]   Oops.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   Oops.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:08.880]   Because you can never have too much drama.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.440]   Apple denied the trademark for multi-touch.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.520]   Now this is not the patent.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.760]   Nobody can patent multi-touch.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:23.560]   But Apple wanted a trademark on the term capital M-U-L-T-I-T capital T-O-U-C-H.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.040]   They applied for that trademark.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:31.400]   The day the iPhone was announced in 2007 and I've never heard of the patent and trademark
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.000]   office denying anything to anybody but apparently they denied it.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.440]   And Apple immediately appealed and in the board the appeal board said no.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.440]   No.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.760]   Because it's frankly too generic.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.000]   The term multi-touch has taken on generic meaning.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.360]   So sorry.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.920]   No tears of sadness.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920]   No.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.920]   No.
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.920]   No.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:00.920]   You want some?
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.560]   Samsung is countersuing Apple in the Hague.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:07.560]   Just like saying the Hague.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.280]   Well, I always thought that we brought the Hague for something.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.480]   I didn't think it would be for this but okay.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.120]   Actually this one is hysterical.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.280]   They claim the iPad and the iPhone violate 3G technology patents held by Samsung and
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:25.680]   they want 2.4% on all iPhone chipsets.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:33.120]   2.4% for every chipset per patent within its 3G capable iPhones and iPads.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.280]   Apple said wait a minute.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.600]   We're already paying Intel for this.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.360]   Intel provides the chipset.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:49.280]   Samsung says Apple has other component suppliers and is obfuscating the other suppliers.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.480]   Samsung also said Apple knew about these patents in 2007 when the iPhone was released and declined
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.320]   to license.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:01.040]   All of this is just about you know it's like they're in there.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.280]   It's like they're in their trenches.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.600]   I know you are but what I'm on.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:10.400]   They're shooting at each other and they're just hoping one of them draws blood.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.000]   Apple has drawn some blood.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   They have.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.360]   They're not trying anymore.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.320]   Well and it's not the problem that I think Samsung has.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.440]   It's not just I mean for all of this it's not just it's Oracle.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.440]   It's Microsoft.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.240]   It's everyone got a piling on.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.680]   Verizon's taking sides by the way.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.320]   They provided a Mika's Curie Eye.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.840]   The legal it's boy I'm glad I stayed in Latin high school.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:42.880]   A legal brief opposing the preliminary injunction against Samsung smartphones and tablets.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.840]   It would allow the brief allows Verizon to intervene as a third party in the case.
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:53.840]   Remember that Apple said they were trying to keep Samsung from settling the Galaxy tab,
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:58.520]   the infuse, the Galaxy S and the Droid charge in the US.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:10.680]   So hearingless as October 13th and of course Verizon has some of those things.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:14.040]   Android market share is interesting.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.120]   The iPhone market share by carrier.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.880]   This is from an article in Ars Technica.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.080]   76% of iPhones are at AT&T.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.960]   23.9% are at Verizon.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.040]   It is hard to switch.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.200]   I mean I have threatened to switch to Verizon.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.320]   The problem is my whole family is on my headset.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.880]   I'd have to move you know a whole bunch of phones.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:41.480]   Andy if you were to buy an iPhone next week or whenever they make it available AT&T Verizon
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.880]   are sprint.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:48.200]   Definitely Verizon because that means that later on when it goes when I'm going to want
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.880]   up to a 4G phone either be it an iPhone by someone hit the other maker I'll want it
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:52.880]   to be on the Verizon network.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.880]   Good point.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.360]   That's a very good point.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:01.120]   I won't ask you Don because you have to choose between Vodafone, O2.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.920]   You have like lots of Troy orange.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:08.120]   Yeah actually someone sent me a note today that 3Mobile has just announced a new plan
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.640]   which is an unlimited data plan for an extra 3 pound a month.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640]   That's nothing.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.080]   3 pounds is what?
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.080]   400 dollars?
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   What is 3 pounds?
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.080]   Soon Leo.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.080]   Soon.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.080]   Six to seven dollars.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.720]   No no it's not even that much.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.720]   Not even that much.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.720]   It's fairly cheap.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.280]   Yeah but that's where the contract goes.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.360]   I'd have to check on the contract prices but interesting that they you know because they're
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.720]   starting to see how they can differentiate themselves between each other.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.200]   So that's the first unlimited plan that I've seen for a while.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.520]   Others are doing really cheap deals for data now anyway which is great.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.880]   Alex you said AT&T because your family's AT&T.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.880]   It's just an IT&T Verizon.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.120]   Well and here's the worst part is is that and this may be the only reason I don't jump
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.360]   immediately on the new phone is me trying to make a decision but even my you know you're
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.720]   in trouble when your 16 year old daughter said well you know she goes this phone's fine
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.440]   but I'm looking forward to the new one and I was like really you're looking forward to
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.200]   the new one because you think I'm going to buy you one.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.200]   You are.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.200]   You are.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.200]   You just move on to another conversation.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.320]   You know yeah I expect to get a new one.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.320]   So anyway.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.320]   2/5.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.320]   5/5.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.320]   There's three small daughters the latest iPhone.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.320]   Yes they do.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.360]   So they get the second hand ones are really little the two and a four year old.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.600]   They're playing with the hand me downs you know they haven't they haven't started asking
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.800]   but you know playing there was a my I think I Twitter this but my daughter kept on saying
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.880]   this thing she's holding the iPad and she's two years old.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.720]   She's holding the iPhone and she's apple plexic she's just like she's looking at me saying
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:40.560]   something and it took me a little while to kind of sort this all out until I realized
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:44.200]   what she was saying was iPad needs charged.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:49.280]   How old is she two years old she's two years old and it took me a little while to it.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.280]   And what does it sound like?
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280]   iPad need you.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.280]   I mean I need you.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.280]   I play a new job.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.280]   I play a new job.
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.960]   And I said what is it Malek I looked at me and he goes iPad needs char he's like a translator.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.120]   He knew Malek I'd translate.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:03.040]   A two year old is telling you the iPad needs charged.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.040]   She's not you know she's no longer I mean.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:09.400]   Holy well that means she's not like a four year old brother who just puts a charge.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.120]   She's not going to be fooled by stuff like this.
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:17.200]   This is Vtech has announced a learning tablet for four to nine year olds.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.760]   It's basically an $80 fake iPad.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.320]   Yes I wouldn't fool her.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.040]   See that's what I thought I look at this and I think you're going to this will fool
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.040]   a six month old.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.040]   She's going to give me a look at this.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.080]   She's going to look at me like what do I look like?
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.720]   Chop liver.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.120]   What the hell is this?
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.560]   I told you to get an iPad and you got me in his crap.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.760]   What the hell are you thinking?
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.240]   In but you're saying baby talk yeah.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.240]   Wow.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:46.400]   It's an interesting bid but kids would have to be particularly I will admit my kids will
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.160]   play with anything with the screen temporarily.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:51.600]   I mean yeah but they definitely it's like come on.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.600]   Come on.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.720]   This doesn't have the fluid multi-judged gestures that I've become used to.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:57.720]   Holy it sounds like.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:58.720]   The nonchalant.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.320]   I got to say that what's scary is the nonchalant fashion in which she hits the power you know
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:07.400]   she hits the little on button and then she just kind of swipes it open and then she goes
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.840]   like this and she's just finds it finds it finds the finds a itsy bitsy spider and clicks
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:15.400]   on and she know that the charge is low because it doesn't turn on.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.320]   I mean it's all I mean it was like as soon as it goes off she's there's like this now
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.720]   and now that I'm a she's not like doesn't look at the battery and it no no no she's
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:27.280]   just it's not she knows that when she hits the bottom button and it doesn't come on it
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.200]   needs to be charged kids today.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.200]   Yes.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:38.080]   A couple of quickies apples earnings report they've announced now October 18th that will
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:43.840]   be right about I would guess right about when the iPhone 5 starts showing up in stores.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:48.160]   Yeah, maybe like an hour later.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.120]   Wisconsin library is now offering iPads to check out.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.880]   That's a nice library.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.840]   You can borrow an iPad from the entire library installed.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.600]   The IE or Ellie Phillips Memorial Public Library in Eau Claire, Wisconsin has 32 or they're
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.000]   the first generation iPads 32 first generation iPads.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.560]   You can get it for a week if you're a card holder in good standing and then six others
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.160]   are available for homebound card holders for a month.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.920]   And then if you just want to be in the library they have another 30 or 40 that just you know
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.440]   are kind of in the library.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.440]   It's great I do.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.760]   They're preloaded with a thousand books.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.920]   Pride and prejudice and the adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.360]   I mean that's just the that's comes with the iBook plus associated a certain assorted
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.520]   audio books and apps.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.760]   They got a grant to do this.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.720]   That is very interesting.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.360]   By the way, the overdue fee for the iPad.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.200]   Ten dollars a day.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:51.680]   After ten days full replacement cost of the iPad along with accessory items, that's about
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.000]   a thousand bucks they say.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.720]   So I think it's a profit deal.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.720]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.160]   I think they're figuring we're going to make some money on this one.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.280]   Twitter is going to have a developer meeting October 12th.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.520]   Remember October 13th is Apple earnings.
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:07.520]   Wow.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:15.360]   Well, Twitter is having a developer event to discuss iOS, iOS 5 integration with Twitter.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.960]   So they're going to London and New York.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:17.960]   They're going to talk.
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.760]   I wonder if this still gets back into the whole voice activation because I have to admit
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:26.680]   there's a lot of times that Twitter would be more fun if you were doing it with a voice
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.680]   activation.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:31.480]   Send instead of saying overheard you can go like this.
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:32.480]   Save that again.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.480]   Wow.
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.480]   Wow.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.480]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:40.560]   Actually, it's October 18th for the earnings call October 12th of the developers.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:46.000]   And Apple has donated 9,000 iPads to teachers working in impoverished schools.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.200]   I think that is really cool.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.200]   Those impoverished schools are in the US.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.800]   It's the Teach for America program.
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.640]   They're the first generation iPads.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.640]   That's fine.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.040]   Have you seen the ad for their for their this is the best time to learn?
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.880]   Yeah, it is so effective.
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.440]   They're smart actually.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.040]   These are the iPads that customers donated.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.040]   Remember Apple asked for your old iPad during the iPad to launch?
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.880]   9,000 of them.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:14.880]   So that's really cool.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.480]   So Apple didn't actually donate it.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.640]   Apple organized it.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.560]   They organized it.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.560]   They organized it.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:24.240]   And they probably put some money to refurbing and so forth.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.240]   It's refurbished.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.960]   Looks like new.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.600]   Why not great idea?
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:35.640]   And then the schools can become high schools.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:39.800]   Steve Jobs wife is a member of the board of directors of Teach for America.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:45.480]   And we mentioned this last week the Hong Kong and Shanghai Apple stores opened up massive
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.480]   crowds.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:51.880]   Although in this picture, most of the crowd is the Apple employees in the blue shirts
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:57.560]   managing the flow managing the flow 300 people camped overnight.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.920]   That would never happen in the United States.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.040]   That's just crazy for the opening of the first door in Hong Kong, some for as long as two
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.360]   days to be among the first inside.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.360]   It is beautiful.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.360]   Look at this.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.360]   It's the overpass.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.160]   That's just gorgeous.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.360]   Hey, Andy, have you gone over to Grand Central Station?
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.000]   I know they've already started work, but they probably haven't opened that Grand Central
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   Station Apple store yet.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   You're going to go over and check it out.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.560]   I was actually hoping to sometime either later today or my way back home tomorrow.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.280]   Yeah, because I think they've already started.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.280]   Since where was?
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.040]   It is time now, ladies and gentlemen, for our iOS and Lion tips and then our picks of
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.240]   the week.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.240]   We haven't been here in so long.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.640]   Do you want to do an iOS tip?
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.640]   I wasn't ready because I saw all these things.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:42.000]   I thought people were now sending me.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   Forget it.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.400]   Forget it.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.560]   I have emails already.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.560]   Emails.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.880]   Do you want to do a Lion tip?
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.280]   I can do it.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:54.120]   I like to change it from a Lion tip to a Mac OS tip.
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.120]   Okay.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.680]   There's so many tips that I've never used.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.600]   I can't believe you can do it.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.520]   You should just say it's Lion tip.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:05.040]   I believe that this is an actual Lion tip.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:10.680]   Apple has always had built-in readers for a whole bunch of different file formats.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:13.360]   They added, I do believe this is new in Lion.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:18.720]   They added some little extra functionality so that if someone emails you an I-worked
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:23.520]   document or any Microsoft Office document, but you don't have I-work and you don't have
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.080]   Microsoft Office, that's okay.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:30.400]   Because the Lion version of Preview will not only let you open and read them, but also
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.400]   let you print those documents.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.480]   It's possible you won't even have to download the 30-day trial if all you need to do is
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:40.560]   print off a copy of a contract or something and sign it and send it back.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.560]   That's pretty cool.
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:42.560]   Tell you what.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.560]   I'll give you an email, Alex.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.160]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.560]   From Bruce, we now have an email address, Macbreak@twit.tv.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.040]   I know Alex uses Flipboard.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.040]   Do you have any tips?
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.080]   He just bought his iPad yesterday.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.320]   He just installed a bunch of stuff on Flipboard.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.440]   I don't have any tips other than it's the best application on, it's one of the best
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:59.440]   applications on the iPad.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:03.440]   I mean, it just, I, that Lingbag experience of sitting there and being able to have my
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.960]   coffee and flip through massive amounts of news.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.960]   I use all of this.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:15.080]   It is just the best way to kind of get the morning grazing of what's going on.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.080]   It's a magazine.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.880]   It feels like a magazine, but it's so much.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.080]   My pick of the week is going to be related.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.360]   I'm going to tell you about something related a little bit.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.000]   I have a tip though.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.680]   This is one thing that I do because one of the things I want to do always with Flipboard
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.720]   is if I see an article that would be good for Macbreak or one of our other shows, I want
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:34.320]   to be able to kind of memorialize it.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.600]   They don't have pinboard and they don't have the integration to the bookmarking services
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.160]   that I like to use.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.760]   But what I did is you can retweet.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.760]   Because it's very Twitter focused.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.800]   What I did is I created a new Twitter account that's just for links.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.520]   It's called links_for_twit.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:55.240]   I made that the default Twitter account on Flipboard.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:01.400]   Now, whenever I want to remember something, I will retweet it and it will show up in my
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.040]   links for Twit feed.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:05.280]   Here's the nice part.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.120]   Pinboard, which is the bookmarking service.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.680]   I use pinboard.in.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:14.200]   We'll monitor a Twitter feed looking for new stuff.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.680]   I can even put hashtags in it and all of that stuff.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.920]   Then I tweet it out.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.200]   That's the way I found that it actually makes Flipboard even more useful for me as I'm reading
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.760]   and I love reading in Flipboard.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.040]   I far prefer it to the other news readers on the Mac.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:31.040]   I can still retweet an article and it will then get into our feed and ultimately into
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.040]   our doc.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.040]   That's awesome.
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040]   Isn't that a nice tip?
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040]   That's a great tip.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.400]   I do have one more quick tip.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.400]   Please.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:42.400]   If you're hoping to wake up to your iPhone, just know that if you mute your iPhone, it
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.640]   will come on at full volume.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:46.760]   You know, your alarm will come on at whatever volume you have set to.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:51.120]   If you turn your volume down on your iPhone, it's really soft.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120]   Did you come in a way?
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.720]   I didn't oversleep when somebody else did.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.880]   That's where a lot of these tips come from, being very frustrated with someone because
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.400]   they showed up a little late.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:02.080]   That might have just been an excuse, but just in case you're wondering if you're hoping
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080]   to use it.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.400]   I use my iPhones on alarm every morning.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.400]   That's a good tip.
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.480]   So mute it by the switch, mute it with the switch and then it'll overall stick.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480]   But don't turn it down.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.360]   The other thing you know is that if you mute it with the switch, don't expect it to mute
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.360]   your alarms.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.720]   Ah, the alarm comes up.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.120]   Here's the links for Twitter account, by the way.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:22.040]   And you can see the ones that I've put in, I have the little Twit logo, but I have other
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.080]   people that I follow on there.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.360]   But there's a lot of links.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.640]   This is a good account to follow that article about Santoram.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:29.640]   In Google.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.640]   No, that's not in there, isn't it?
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.240]   No, you're seeing this article about Mac cuts.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.800]   I saw Santoram at the bottom.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:35.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.520]   But it says Santoram and Google search qualities are Mac cuts make the Colbert report.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.520]   That's Santoram just extra.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.000]   I know what you're talking about that.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.920]   We're just not going to talk about that.
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.400]   Let's see if I have another email.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.760]   I'm an engineering student writes Will S and I have listened to the show for a couple
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:51.760]   of years now.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.760]   Love it.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.120]   I got a lot of scanned PDF from my professors and I'd like to read or annotate them on my
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.640]   iPad with good reader.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.920]   What's the best and cheapest tool to use on the Mac to OCR an existing PDF and have it
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:10.000]   output with image over text so that it looks the same, but I can select the text and the
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.880]   equations and charts retain their formatting Will S writes.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:16.680]   Do you have a suggestion Andy anything leap to mind on that one?
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:18.520]   I use I annotate.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.520]   I use a good one.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.080]   It actually makes us a new one.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.080]   It's a ball.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.080]   People actually makes one.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.080]   I can't think of the name of the thing.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.080]   It's Omni reader or Omni.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:27.080]   Omni page.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.680]   And that's the one I use and it works really well.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.640]   I haven't compared it to a lot of other ones.
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.640]   Omni.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:32.640]   Is that true?
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:33.640]   It's the off PDFs.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:34.640]   Was it?
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.640]   Sorry.
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.640]   Sorry.
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.640]   To OCR PDFs is it?
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:38.640]   Yes.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.640]   In the pro version does OCR.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:42.640]   I use it on a basis.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:43.640]   It's actually a scam.
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.640]   It's a little better.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.640]   It'll do as well.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:46.640]   Will it?
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.080]   So scan it with your scanner and then open the PDF, scan it to a PDF.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.120]   Open the PDF with PDF pen and you'll get text.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.080]   You can then scan it from within PDF pen and it will generate the machine readable text.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:01.960]   I love, you know, I used to use GoodReader and now because iBook takes PDFs.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.960]   I just put every PDF in iBooks.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.880]   I have a bookshelf on my iBooks of all the PDFs.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:07.880]   I love it.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:08.880]   And I have every manual.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.760]   It's exactly what I have.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.920]   Every single technical manual that I have.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.920]   I don't even keep many.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.960]   I'm like, you get this little piece of paper and I'm just like, okay, I first have a camera
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.000]   and then I put it on there and then I throw it away.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.320]   I put all my hand, all these radios, you know, these hand radios have big, thick document.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.320]   It's all in iBooks.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   It's really great.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.320]   And it's only in English.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.760]   Sorry, you get all these manuals that are like an 8-minute.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.040]   Now you remember we were talking about the fact that I had my iPhone fixed and people
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.800]   were saying, oh no, you could bring it in.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:38.480]   We got an anonymous genius writing.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.360]   He says, we go through these works at the Genius Bar.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.720]   We go through a lot of effort to make people happy, including, yes, swapping their broken
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:44.720]   phones.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.400]   But here are the criteria that we're supposed to use.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:52.680]   Your phone is within warranty or up to 45 days outside of it.
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.080]   That's good to know.
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:57.680]   You haven't done this a bunch of times.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.160]   We take a detailed notes based on the serial number of your phone and the history travels
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.040]   along with the swapped devices.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.840]   So you don't get an infinite number of trades.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.440]   They also say, he also says, don't lie about what happened.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.440]   And don't go to someone else who mucks it up.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:16.720]   If something seems odd, we'll take it back to the back disassemble it and then we'll
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:17.720]   know.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.120]   So don't, don't just, if it breaks, bring it to the Genius Bar.
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.600]   Bonus info.
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:31.600]   If you are super nice or if your store is super nice, or I'm sorry, or if you're super
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.600]   sad.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.880]   If your story is super sad.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.720]   They're allowed to give you up to one device completely free.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.640]   We put ourselves out there when we need to do that though.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.720]   So you really have to need it.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.600]   In other words, they have to, I guess, justify it to their manager.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:47.400]   But his story was really sad.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   So make sure you have it.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:52.560]   My dad dropped his iPhone for four days after he bought it and they replaced it and then
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.320]   he bought an otterbox for it to make it.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.320]   It never happened to do it.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.320]   No, that's exactly my daughter.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.200]   I bought it on iPhone 4 when she came back for Christmas.
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.640]   She broke it within a week.
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.440]   It fell out of her pocket or something.
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:08.320]   She brought it to the Apple Store and because we had just bought it and she made a sad story,
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.880]   they just without any charge gave her a new one.
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.600]   So that's nice.
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.800]   This applies to the iPad as well, although the prices are higher.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:22.840]   Your warranty makes it very clear that we don't have to do any of this.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:26.000]   So they've never, they've never contractually obligated to do it.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.440]   They just, he says, "We genuinely want to help you if we can."
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.160]   He says, "If you, nice shot.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.160]   What's that?"
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.040]   I like it though, but I don't know what it has to do with what I'm saying here.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.040]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.040]   Was there a nip slip?
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.840]   I'll be talking about the things that they just abruptly cut away.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:46.080]   It was like on Dancing With The Stars, exactly.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:51.560]   They had to abruptly cut away because I took my shirt off and said, "You want this, bro?"
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.560]   Your warranty makes it very clear we don't have to do any of this.
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.000]   We genuinely want to help you if we can.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.360]   If you approach with a sense of entitlement or a jerk, it really tends to sour us towards
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.600]   doing these things.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:01.600]   So this is good.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.600]   They have a lot.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:03.600]   Sounds like they have considerable leeway.
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.320]   Thank you for that.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:08.040]   That's great and we won't mention any names.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.920]   It is now time for our picks of the week.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:15.160]   Let us start with Don McAllister who probably sees more software than any human alive.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.160]   Okay.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:18.360]   Well, I'm not actually going to do a software pick.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.120]   I'm going to do a hardware pick.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.120]   What?
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.120]   Okay.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:26.960]   But I'm also going to preface it with a request that I need to follow through in that one
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:32.120]   of the fans of the show, Gagor Paul Clark, who's putting together an exhibition of digital
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:35.760]   trees at the big event in London in a week or two.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:40.640]   And what he would like us to do is to write or draw a tree on your iPad and send it through
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:44.360]   to him and he'll put this digital forest together, specifically of twit trees.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:45.840]   Now, Eileen sent me one.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.840]   I've done one.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.800]   I spoke to Alex at the pre-show, so he's going to do one.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.880]   So if Andy and Leo could do one, I think, yeah, Eileen's got those Eileen's tricks.
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:54.880]   Oh.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.640]   And then Don's is the one to the right corner here.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:57.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:58.640]   Nice, Don.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:31:59.640]   Wow.
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:00.640]   No pressure.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:04.240]   The thing is the Bob Ross of Magbrig Weekly.
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.240]   Wow.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.240]   That's impressive.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.000]   I'm going to add some little leaves here.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.040]   So my pick, how do we do it?
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.280]   But before you say that, how do we do it?
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:20.720]   Well, if you just draw the tree and then it'll create, you know, just create an image
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:21.720]   file and send it to me.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.200]   I'll pass them on to Paul and he can't.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.560]   So he doesn't have a public site that people could.
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:28.120]   I think I'll send you a link.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:32.720]   He's got some previous forest that he's done and a link to the exhibition as well.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:35.680]   It's the skills, I think it's the London Skills Works exhibition.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:40.960]   So a huge exhibition, four-day exhibition, and next week, it starts the day after the
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:41.960]   keynote.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.160]   But he's put a special exhibit together and he wants to have the Twit Forest as a bit
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.560]   of a centerpiece to it.
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:51.280]   So he's making forests based on people's drawings of trees.
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.000]   Eileen, would you remind me to do that?
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000]   Yes, I would.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.480]   And we'll get Sarah Lane to do it from iPad to date.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.840]   Yeah, and Tom and all the other guys there, that'd be great.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.040]   So this is my pick.
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.040]   Yes.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:03.840]   This, which is the thing I use to create my tree.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.000]   It's actually a pogo...
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.320]   Oh, the pogo is pogo pen.
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.480]   Pogo Sketch Pro.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:13.320]   I've had a pogo before, but the normally only little tiny things.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:17.560]   This is a really nice stylus, which is like a proper pen.
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.120]   I tried to draw the tree with my finger and it didn't really work out to be honest with
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:22.280]   this is really, really good.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:24.320]   You can sort of hold it at all different angles.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.520]   Am I actually shot here?
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   Oh, there we go.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.520]   Look at that.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.760]   Oh, that's so nice.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.480]   So Alex was one to turn me out of the pogo sketch from 10/1 design.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.040]   And in fact, I bought three and gave because they were so popular, you couldn't keep them
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.120]   in stock at the time.
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.120]   I keep on losing them.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.800]   So I bought three and I gave you one and can I have it back?
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.360]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.360]   But now I want this.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.360]   This looks really great.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360]   So it's the same idea.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   It's a capacitance device with a soft rubber tip.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:52.360]   And it's nice.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.880]   It's having a larger version of it.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:54.880]   It looks awesome.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880]   It's like a real pen.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.880]   It's like a real pen.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:57.880]   And it's multi-angle.
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.280]   It's got like a rounded nib.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:01.080]   You get a spare nib with it as well.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.080]   So you can change it.
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.920]   But it's weighted really nicely.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:06.240]   It's metal with a rubber grip.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.280]   And I just found it really, really nice to-- because I'm not a drawer.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:11.520]   I don't draw normally.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.000]   And that was the first drawing I'd attempted.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.480]   And I say my finger wasn't working very well with it.
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.040]   I couldn't really do it with my finger.
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:21.120]   But this, you know, I could actually draw a fairly decent drawing with it.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.120]   So well-recognized.
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.520]   There's $25, I think, around that mark.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.520]   Well worth it.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:26.520]   Yeah, 25 talks.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.400]   I wonder if I can get it in time to draw my tree.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.320]   I'm sure you could.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.120]   I need it.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.080]   I want to compete with-- I'm very competitive.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.880]   I have to make my tree as good as yours.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:39.880]   I'm very competitive.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:42.920]   Well, my wife still thinks it looks like a volcano, but we won't go there.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:43.920]   Oh, no.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.920]   I think it looks great.
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:45.920]   Thank you, Don.
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:49.680]   Alex, Lindsey, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.080]   Holy cow, I mean, let me give you the-- do you have a mini DisplayPort on there?
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.080]   I do.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:55.080]   Here, you can just plug that in.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:58.840]   You wouldn't actually be able to see this on the screen.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:34:59.840]   I think.
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:00.840]   It might be too high a resolution for us.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:01.840]   I don't know.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:02.840]   I don't see anything.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:03.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.840]   Here it comes.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.880]   If it's going to screw you up, though, because it's going to change the resolution.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:08.880]   Maybe not.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:09.880]   Did you see it?
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:10.880]   I see a blue screen.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.800]   Yeah, you have to change it to a lower res, I think.
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:14.800]   What is that?
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:15.800]   Do I see this?
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.800]   Yes, you see that.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.800]   All right.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:18.800]   Hello.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:19.800]   Hello.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.800]   Oh, now it's unhappy.
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:21.800]   It was fine before.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.800]   Hold on.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.160]   It looks like-- OK, I see VU meters.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.760]   Let's guess what this is, everybody.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.680]   It's obviously an audio device.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.680]   Maybe it's a seismograph.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:29.680]   Let me see if I can--
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:31.080]   Does it measure volcanic activity?
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.080]   It broke something.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.560]   No, it just-- it was fine.
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.560]   Close it.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.560]   No, put it again, maybe.
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.560]   All right, OK, hold on.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.560]   What is it called?
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:38.560]   Let's see, let me show you some of my sounds.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.560]   So this is called Spectre.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.560]   It's available on the Mac App Store.
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:45.960]   And it is-- and I somehow have broken it.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:48.920]   It doesn't like switching the resolutions, obviously.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:49.920]   So anyway, so--
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:51.680]   Sorry, I shouldn't have made you do that.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.680]   That's fine.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.280]   What it does is--
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.160]   I'm just trying to figure out why it is unhappy now.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:58.680]   Oh, there we go.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.680]   There it is.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.320]   Ooh, look at that.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.320]   All right, so--
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.600]   What the hell?
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.920]   So anyway-- so actually, I hadn't heard of this.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.840]   I'd heard of the app, but I hadn't really used it.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.640]   And then I--
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:14.320]   Neil Bernard from BBC TV--
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.920]   I'm not in BBC, sorry, Neil-- Bloomberg TV in the UK.
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:19.640]   I was in London last week.
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.240]   And he gave me a tour, but one of the things
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.520]   he pulled out when we were on set,
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.720]   he was helping me out with Salesforce Stream.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.600]   And he brought this out to analyze our audio.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.680]   And I was smitten.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:32.680]   I guess we should have this.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.000]   I think we should have the technical term here.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.600]   And so these are all-- you can just design what you want here,
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.560]   but you got the BBC meter, which is what I was looking at when
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:38.920]   I said that.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:41.440]   And then the VU meter, you've got your spectrograph
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.400]   to see where things are going.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.000]   You've got your spectrogram oscilloscope.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.240]   And beyond anything else, it just looks awesome.
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.240]   You know?
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:49.760]   Well--
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:50.240]   Here's the thing--
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.520]   It's 99 bucks worth awesome.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.520]   That's the question.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.600]   It is-- well, the thing is, is that these meters are actually
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:56.280]   pretty accurate.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.880]   And when you're trying to figure out--
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.040]   on a day-to-day basis, when everything's working,
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.280]   it's not that important.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.840]   When bad things are happening, you can't figure out
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.840]   what's going on.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.680]   When there's noise, what you'll do is, like in the spectrogram
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:14.080]   down here, you'll see little lines that represent these homes.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.080]   In fact, you know--
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.440]   [DINGING]
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.520]   Hey, that's pretty good.
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.120]   I got a big sign wave going there.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.440]   [DINGING]
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.560]   Next time on Ghost Lab.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.560]   Ooh, ooh, do you see the spike?
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.640]   Did you see the spike?
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:33.040]   So it's a lot of fun.
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.880]   It's a little notch in there.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.000]   You might sign there.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.760]   This is fun.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.280]   That's why I own an oscilloscope.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.320]   I've never used it to diagnose or fix anything.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.240]   I just--
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:45.920]   I just like to see the little one go.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:46.420]   Right.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.560]   And like for the oscilloscope, for instance,
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:49.120]   doesn't make a lot of sense when we're talking
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.400]   other than looking cool.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:52.320]   But it doesn't make sense if you're doing test signals
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.080]   and so on and so forth.
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.600]   They're going to see what you're going as far as--
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.520]   Hands would use this.
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:56.720]   This is really-- this is great.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.720]   And testing, if you want to test lines
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:01.120]   and making sure that your XLR cable is working,
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:02.480]   these are a lot of the test things.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:10.480]   And this-- the peak and the medium for the level meter
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.600]   is actually really useful to know if you're really peaking.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.480]   It gives you a little bit more information.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:15.880]   It turns out-- I mean, as it--
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:17.760]   Is it using the built-in mic, but you--
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:18.800]   Right now, it's using the built-in.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.200]   But we can have it look at our Kona card or whatever.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.440]   You know, that's what we had is--
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.520]   basically, we had this hookup.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:25.720]   So if you're getting some buzz or hum.
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:26.360]   This is basically--
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:26.720]   What is this?
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:27.360]   The scopes.
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.120]   You know, like scopes for video, this is the--
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:29.640]   That's awesome.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:30.160]   The scopes version.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.160]   And it's pretty nifty.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:35.000]   There's another one that has a couple more features called--
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.040]   Spectro by the way, it's--
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:36.480]   Scopes Pro.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.640]   And it was a bit more expensive.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:40.440]   S-P-E-C-T-R-E. It's British spelling.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.800]   And there's a $50 starter version and then the $100.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.960]   And of course, I just--
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:46.720]   You know me.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.200]   So anyway, so it was--
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:51.160]   And you can design how you have the windows and set them all
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:51.360]   up.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.160]   And I like it a lot.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.520]   So anyway, that's my--
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:57.520]   That is a great demo of just the Mac, you know,
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.440]   that it can do that in real time.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:02.640]   Yeah, you pay-- you can pay a lot of money for scopes
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:05.800]   that will look exactly the same.
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:06.480]   Neat.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.680]   It will also use network sources.
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:09.440]   Yeah, it's just cool.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:10.520]   And what we did is--
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.440]   what was this was really valuable for is we--
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:15.000]   I was actually monitoring using Soundflower.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.160]   I was monitoring our stream.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:20.080]   We were monitoring the streams, how it returned back
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:22.640]   to our computer over from the internet
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.520]   to make sure that we were getting the proper levels.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.200]   And we're getting quality.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.480]   And so it was good.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.320]   That's nifty.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:31.240]   Annie and Ico, your pick of the week.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:34.440]   I'm a big fan of Amtrak chiefly because in certain areas
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:37.360]   like the East Coast, it usually even makes more sense
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.360]   to take the train from point A to point B than to fly.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.520]   It's actually cheaper from Boston to New York.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.560]   It's actually faster when you factor in all the time you
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.800]   take to get into Midtown from the airport.
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:50.080]   And of course, you get to spend three and a half hours
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.000]   in a nice big cozy comfy chair next to a standard AC outlet.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:55.960]   And there's a cafe car.
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.560]   So whenever you want to get a dam soda,
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:00.040]   you go up and you get a dam soda.
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:04.240]   But I think just today or not today, within the past few days,
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:08.720]   Amtrak finally came out with their own iPad, iPhone app.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.000]   And it's really well done.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.480]   It's a very, very iOS.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.080]   It's based iOS look and iPhone app.
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:16.080]   It's not just one of these.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.080]   Oh, we built a web app and then just encapsulated it
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.320]   in something.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:24.360]   And so it's once you log in, it knows everything
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.520]   about your current trip and upcoming trips.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.840]   It has the full station guide.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.200]   It has schedules.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:33.760]   And you also can-- excuse me, not only where
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.040]   there's a local station, but also all the information
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:37.960]   you need about that station.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.160]   So how many parking spaces, how late they open,
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.360]   that sort of stuff.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:42.960]   But what I also really like about it
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.600]   is that it's easy to make changes in your reservations
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:47.760]   right from the phone.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.680]   Because one of the other really big advantages of Amtrak
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:54.920]   is that right now I'm booked on a train
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.640]   early in the afternoon tomorrow.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.240]   If something comes up and I want to take a later train,
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:02.200]   all I have to do is show up for that later train.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:05.440]   And if there's any price difference in those two tickets,
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.440]   all I do is pay basically just what that price difference is.
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:11.640]   There's no $150 rebooking fee or anything like that.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.760]   So now I can do all that right from here.
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:16.320]   So as soon as I decide that my plans have changed,
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:17.840]   I can just go right here, find out
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.200]   when the next train is or when the tomorrow's train is,
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.880]   and then just make that change from there.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.600]   So it's free from the app store.
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.200]   It's just another example of why the iPhone works so well
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.240]   for so many people.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:31.800]   You wouldn't have bought it just for the Amtrak app.
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:34.920]   But there comes that day when you realize that, oh, look,
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.160]   they've released a cool app.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.840]   And now this is exactly what I--
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.880]   this is not going to enhance my life every time
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.120]   I write on Amtrak.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:44.960]   So this is, once again, justifying spending $250
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.160]   to break yourself out of your existing contract
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.720]   so you can buy an iPhone from whatever you got before.
[01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:50.920]   I think smartphone is--
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:53.240]   I mean, it doesn't have to be in-- this case, it's an iPhone.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:53.960]   Do they have an Android?
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.760]   They might even have an Android app.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.040]   But I mean, the point is this is--
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.360]   smartphones are what make the difference, not iPhone
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.960]   in particular.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:05.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.240]   No, I'm not attacking you.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:10.200]   No, no, no.
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.720]   You were right to attack me.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:13.640]   You were right.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.920]   I misspoke in a very, very simple way.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.160]   And you were too right on me.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.320]   Boom.
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.040]   That damn Benjamin doesn't do that.
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:24.960]   He sent me a cookie wreath.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:26.520]   OK.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.800]   You want a cookie wreath?
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:32.000]   No, number two-- most popular podcast on iTunes,
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.280]   as of today, I've just been tweeting.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:34.680]   Number two now.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:36.440]   Number two in all categories.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.480]   In the US.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:38.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.800]   We're coming after you this American life among bastards
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:45.080]   with those old, tiny glasses.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:47.040]   Guess Leo didn't know what the hell he's talking about when
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:47.880]   he said no.
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:50.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.560]   What a fool I was.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:53.840]   You showed me, Andy.
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:56.880]   Hey, speaking of number two, we talked about Flipboard
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:00.160]   as being the number one app for reading news on the iPad.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.120]   And I'd agree with that.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.520]   But a new app just came out today.
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.160]   This is a tentative pick, because I haven't had time
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:06.080]   to really play with it yet.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:08.440]   I just downloaded it and started looking at it.
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.360]   It's called Every.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:09.920]   Can you pick up?
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:10.760]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:13.240]   EVRI.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.200]   And it's, while it's not going to be as pretty as Flipboard--
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.040]   and I love the Flipboard interface--
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.440]   it's an interesting idea.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.440]   It's a topic-based news reader.
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.400]   But instead of giving it RSS feeds,
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.800]   you give it topics, and it will search for those topics
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:31.080]   and keep track of them, keep track of what your friends say.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.840]   And every 15 minutes it updates.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:35.920]   So it's a constant feed of information.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:39.600]   EVRI, free, of course, on the iPad.
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.640]   With an ever-increasing amount of news sources
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.440]   available on the web, keeping up the topics--
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.920]   Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.880]   OK, too slow.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:47.880]   Get into it.
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:48.720]   Get into the meat of it.
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:50.440]   She's got an orchid on her screen.
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.840]   You don't have to play the audio.
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:54.960]   I'm just so that we can see the video of it.
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.200]   You can see what it looks like.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:57.400]   That's splice screen.
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:58.920]   I was like, is this Windows 8?
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:01.400]   Yeah, it does look like Windows 8, doesn't it?
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.960]   And apparently it fits right in your purse.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.480]   Anyway, I guess this video is-- there we go.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:09.040]   I just wanted a little bit of a demo of the screen,
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.800]   because I don't have my iPad with me today.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:15.480]   EVRI, something worth looking at.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:18.200]   Meanwhile, if you'd like to listen to the number two podcast
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:22.880]   in all the world, go to 5x5.tv.
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:25.120]   What's it called, the Inako Files?
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.200]   The Inako Almanac.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.080]   Almanac, that's it.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:28.840]   That's it.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:31.520]   And you do it one day of the week.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.920]   We recorded Monday morning, east coast time at about 11.
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:37.160]   And it goes out about early Monday afternoon.
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:38.200]   Perfect.
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:41.040]   It's Andy's latest show, and it's on the 5x5 network.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.920]   And I'm glad that we could give it a little bit of a plug.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:47.680]   And good luck to you with that number two podcast thing.
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.960]   I'm sure-- see, the person who tweeted this tweeted this
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:52.720]   like about a half hour to 45 minutes ago.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.080]   So I'm sure it's only because we started plugging it
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:58.600]   on this, the Twit Network, the Tiffany Network
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.280]   podcast.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:44:59.640]   Nice.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:00.480]   Thanks.
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:03.120]   Good save.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:04.400]   No, I think it's great.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.160]   I can't wait to hear it myself.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:08.280]   Andy Inako is also ready, writes for the Chicago Sun
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:11.840]   Times and his website, www.cw.omba.com.
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:14.760]   Alex Lindsay is at the Pixel Corp, Pixel Corp.com.
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.720]   And Pixel Corp.tv for your podcast.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:18.280]   Great to have you as our next-door neighbor.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.080]   So he installed every already.
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:20.760]   I'm that fast.
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:22.360]   Wasted no time, every--
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:23.760]   everying.
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:28.480]   And Don McAllister is at screencastsonline.com.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.000]   There are some free screencasts there,
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.520]   but subscribe for all the really good stuff he's also
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:33.680]   at Don McAllister on Twitter.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:34.760]   Thank you for being here, Don.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.360]   Can you come back next week and join
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:37.800]   our coverage of the new--
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:39.360]   Yeah, show it results me out.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:39.880]   No problem.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.640]   I think it's going to be an iPhone, but who knows?
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:45.760]   We'll be doing that live 10 AM Pacific.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:47.440]   That's 1 PM Eastern time.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.000]   So an hour earlier than our normal broadcast time
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.520]   for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:53.480]   Probably what we'll do is cover it.
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.680]   And then we'll go into Mac Break Weekly right afterwards
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.600]   and do a full show based on what we learn from Tim Cook,
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:04.800]   his debut as the master of ceremonies.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:07.760]   That again is next Tuesday, 10 AM Pacific.
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.040]   We'll also be covering the Kindle announcement tomorrow
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:15.200]   morning, 7 AM Pacific, 10 AM Eastern time at the Twit.tv.
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.320]   So tune in for that.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:17.400]   Tom Merritt and I.
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.680]   Who else is I going to join us?
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:19.960]   Anyone else going to join us for that?
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:20.720]   We haven't asked.
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:21.320]   We haven't--
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:22.080]   We should ask around.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:23.680]   See who else wants to talk.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:24.160]   All right.
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.520]   This is really the announcement season.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:25.880]   It is.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:26.600]   I love this.
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:27.600]   I love this.
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:28.600]   It's fun for us.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:29.400]   It's fun for us.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.400]   Yeah, free news.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:31.400]   Thank you.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:32.560]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:33.400]   We do Mac Break Weekly.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:36.720]   As I mentioned, 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern on Tuesdays
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.840]   at Twit.tv.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:38.720]   Please do tune in.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.000]   That's 1,800 UTC.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.160]   We'd love to see you.
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:42.520]   And we'll see you next time.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:43.840]   Now get back to work.
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:44.680]   Break time's over.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:56.200]   Shuff your phone, man.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:56.700]   Look at that.
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:57.480]   This is beauty.
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.720]   We're not going to turn it on.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:46:59.680]   Congratulations Leo.
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:00.960]   It was on his new rivals.
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:02.320]   6 pounds, 3 ounces.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.480]   Well, I think that what's going to be good is--
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.920]   Just make sure they're tagged properly.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.240]   One of the reasons I bought this is
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:10.480]   I wanted to make sure that I had this before the iPhone 5
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:11.520]   came out.
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:12.720]   Oh, it's doing some--
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.240]   Oh.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:15.040]   It's doing some sort of Android thing.
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:15.600]   The heck?
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:16.680]   That didn't happen to me.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:18.280]   Fashion.
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:19.080]   Wow.
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:19.720]   What is going on?
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.800]   Just a jail broken.
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:23.320]   It comes out of the box, Joe.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:25.680]   This must be fairly scary to people.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:28.280]   This can't be what it's supposed to do.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:30.520]   That did not happen to me, but I don't have the Sprint phone.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.680]   Is it an Android phone?
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:34.600]   Yeah, I mean, really.
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.920]   OK, Andy, take a screenshot.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:38.240]   If you want to say anything bad about Android phones,
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:39.880]   that's it right there.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:41.240]   Well, I got the Linux command line.
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:42.680]   What could you hate about that?
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:44.520]   There you go.
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.120]   Why did it come?
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:46.480]   I'm sure my parents wouldn't-- that wouldn't
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:48.240]   be a problem for them at all.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.680]   Right now, they're like 18 Linux people in the chat
[01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.680]   where I'm saying, all you have to do
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.600]   is download a tarball and build the proper boot
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.240]   loader.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:56.680]   Were you holding--
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:59.240]   I don't know why you think this is so complicated.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:00.560]   I don't think I was holding anything.
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.240]   You weren't holding the volume in your markers.
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.240]   OK, enter.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.240]   OK key.
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:06.640]   Where's the OK key?
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:07.800]   Oh, dear.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:09.560]   The OK key.
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:12.240]   What the hell key is an OK key?
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:14.720]   This is a new key for him to me.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:17.280]   Oh, I'm so glad this happens during Mac break.
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:17.640]   I know.
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:18.840]   Well, that's why I'm doing it.
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:21.160]   There, apparently the home key is the OK key.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:24.600]   So we'll just let that sit there and simmer for a while.
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:25.560]   Wow.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.960]   i don't know what happened that is exactly what apple people are saying
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:29.760]   they wanted to see
