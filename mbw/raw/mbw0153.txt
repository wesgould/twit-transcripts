[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Apple and Macintosh with me as usual.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   The core group of Mac idiots, starting with Alex Lindsey
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   from Pixelcore.com and Pixelcore.tv.

[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Andy Naco is also here.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Do you have any odd greetings for us Andy Naco?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Do you like to share?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I'm rotating through things.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Ways that I could be saying hello in a foreign tongue
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   that would not seem as though I'm mocking the beautiful language
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   that Alex Lindsey has taken control to actually learn.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   So I'll simply say Mahalo.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Mahalo is good.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   That's a good one.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   That means thank you, right, in Hawaiian.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Is that right?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I've heard -- I'm so totally inexperienced because I've heard
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Mahalo used as a universal greeting and also as a thank you.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   If you go to the Burger Kings in Hawaii instead of the trash receptacles
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   saying thank you, they do say Mahalo, which may be sort of weird
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   about how, gee, all these people were saying Mahalo to me during the week
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   where they really just given me the usual Burger King trash receptacle greeting
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   or is there more to this culture than I can assimilate in ten days of tourist travel?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I want to start the show today with a question of query for our Mac experts
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   and that could be also the people in the chat room who watch us live.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It could be you, Alex or you, Andy.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I'm having trouble with the new iTunes.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   We record one of our shows this weekend tech.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   We do an AAC version and we use iTunes to encode it.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And for some reason with the latest iTunes, what is it, 812?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I can't even remember.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   When we record from, when we take away file, which is our normal workflow
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and AAC it with the same settings we've always used, it's distorted and terrible.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   If we use an MP3, it's fine.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Is it scratchy or is it high pitched?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It's high pitched.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Distorted.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Meth the.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You can hear talking but underneath all the...
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It's very weird.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And I'm wondering if anybody else has had this.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Here's the question is if you change it to an AIF file and then do it.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Does it do the same thing?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I would be thinking that I would try to figure out.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Maybe it could then you'll know whether the bug is on the AAC or the wave.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Chris Jones is saying the chair and the same thing has happened to him.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I don't know how our guys are doing it now because they're...
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   It's getting posted in logic at this point.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   MP3 AAC seems to work fine.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's wave to AAC.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I think they're the right bit, right?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   But maybe that's an issue.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I should see maybe I'm recording 32-bit waves or something weird like that.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Right.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   That would confuse.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah, that could cause a lot of trouble.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Just thought I'd pass that along.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I'm sure I'll hear for some people.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   But we heard from a lot of people when a Twit came out the AAC inaudible.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So I apologize we did replace that.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Did you see folks, Jason Callicanis' case against Apple in five parts at Callicanis.com?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And I thought I'd bring this up.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I almost got Jason on the show but then I thought, "Well, let's discuss it first and then see what we think."
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And then maybe we'll have Jason on.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   "I shall give you the case against Apple."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   He says, "The love affair ends."
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   He is a longtime PC user.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   He says, "Six years and $20,000 ago I made the switch to Apple products after a 20-year love affair with a PC."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   He says, "He's spending a lot of money.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I'll pay $20,000 for the past six years if this is like us.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   If Steve makes something, I buy it.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Sometimes I buy two, one for my wife.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Key point two, I overpay for Apple products because I perceive them to be better."
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The love affair ends.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Steve's a great guy and the love affair has been wonderful but I'm starting to look past him and back to Microsoft for a more healthy relationship that's less, wait for it, anti-competitive in nature.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Oddly enough, since Microsoft was considered the kings of evil, anti-competitive behavior, here's the case in five parts.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And I'll just give you the major issues that he says.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   One, destroying MP3 player innovation through anti-competitive practices, the iPod, I guess, case in point.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   It's ironic because I think the MP3 player took off because of the iPod.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   It was a kind of a moral-bund business until Apple came along.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   But I see what he's saying.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I mean, Apple really has been so dominant in the iPod and because of the DRM, which is now gone, you had to have an iPod to pay black.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Soap and you bought.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   That's rubbish.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I still will argue that almost everybody I knew had far more non-DRM content on their iPod than they ever had DRM content.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   So there's this whole talk about people being locked into their thing and maybe that's the case to some degree.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But for me, 90%, 95% of what was on my iPod was DRM-free.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It was stuff that I had taken off of my own CDs.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   I had thousands of CDs.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I ripped them all.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I ripped all of them and put them all on my iPod.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   All right.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Well, he says part of the problem is that iTunes doesn't sync with any other MP3 player.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   He says not only does Apple not build a simple API to attach devices to iTunes, they actually fight technically and legally block people from building tools to make iTunes more compatible.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I don't think they have any requirement to do that.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   No, I don't think he's saying they're required to, but he says he's not going to support a company.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Okay.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   He says, what would your reaction be if Microsoft made the Zoom the only MP3 player compatible with Windows?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   There before Chan riots, denial of service attacks and digs front page.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   We plastered with pundit editorials claiming Bill Gates and Steve Balmer were bored.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Why then does Steve Jobs get a pass?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Because he's not talking enough.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   They're not making it the iPod isn't the iPod on the iPhone or not the only MP3 players that work with the operating system.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I mean, Jason, he has resources.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   He has money.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   If he thinks that there's a market for a media manager that is absolutely universal that syncs with absolutely anything that is as powerful as iTunes.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Build it.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   The thing is that they're not making it not compatible with OS X.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   They're making it exactly what Andy just said.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   They're making it not compatible with iTunes.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And I think that's a very, when he says it's not compatible with Windows, that is hyperbole.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   That's true.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   If Apple said you can't use your MP3 player with OS X, that would be different.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It's not an Apple's to Apple's comparison.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Also, the chief thing you lose is direct syncing.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   If you want to use iTunes as a playlist manager and then manually move those playlists onto your device, you can certainly do that.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   All right.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Number two.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I think we're going to have to get Jason on to fight back because I'm not going to fight on his behalf.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I think you guys make excellent points.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Number two, monopolistic practices in telecommunications.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I think we're in agreement that so Apple's iPhone is a revolutionary product says Jason that has devolved almost all of the progress made in cracking.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Wait for it.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   AT&T's monopoly in the 70s and 80s.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   We broke up the bell phones only to have it put back together by the iPhone.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Well, that's actually it's been going back together since.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Yeah, number less 10 years.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Telecommunication choices gone for Apple users.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   If you buy an Apple and want to have a seamless experience with your iPhone, you must get in bed with AT&T.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So Apple is not the first phone come, not the first phone manufacturer to exclusively make their product available on one.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Does that make it okay?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   No, but I'm just saying he's picking out Apple like it's Apple's fault.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   You know, that is the way that this product that's the way this process has worked.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It just happens to be they have the biggest phone on.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Congress is investigating handset exclusivity.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Why?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Yeah, and the only reason that an R&T AT&T is because Verizon turned them down.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Right.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And we also should say that I think the operative word in this whole thing is that it's a love affair and no one can hurt you more than a jolt.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   His heart is broken.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Exactly.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Yeah, every other every other phone will work almost as well with the with the Mac as an iPhone.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   If you spend $40 for the missing sync, if you want to BlackBerry syncing, if you want Google.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   True.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It's not like you can't use somebody else's phone with app.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Right.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It's basically that he wants he wants Apple devices to work exactly the way that he wants them to.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   He also wants other devices to work exactly the way that he wants them to.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   That's not reasonable.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Well, I mean, it's it's not unreasonable to want.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It's another one to say, Oh, well, this is a fatal flaw.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And also that Apple is doing things that are wrong.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Although I should back up back away one step and say that Apple really needs to have a game plan for for for dealing with why are why are we denying phone services that compete with AT&T on the iPhone.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I mean, Google voice adds so much added features and so much added power to the iPhone.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And so they need to have a really well thought out and real world answer for why they're why they're not allowing Google voice to work through the through the app store that isn't simply, well, we feel as though we will make more money if we simply deny it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Well, and I completely agree with Andy on that.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And I think that as far as the closed system, I think one of the things is that that is apples.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   That's their their card.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   You know, they're much smaller than Microsoft.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   They're much smaller than what what why people buy Mac and Tasha's are one of the big reasons people buy, you know, join a Mac platform is because of the seamless integration.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   That is part of one of that's that's that's one of the core pieces of their, you know, selling point.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And so of course they're going to protect that.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I mean, I think I think there's a difference between.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   There's there's there's a difference between saying I'm sorry if someone was going to be defending Apple and that just as devil's abdican, they would say that Apple does.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Demand a little tight amount of control between the operating system, the desktop hardware and the handset hardware, but that plays out into advantages for the user as opposed to simple doing something for the sake of control of Apple.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And one more thing is that once you and we know this because we've been dealing with this one or one or piece of software.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Once you release an SDK, you now have the situation where you have backwards compatibility issues.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   You have developers who go crazy every time you change the spec Apple by not releasing an SDK by saying we're really.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Going to not make this available to other people and this comes down to plug in development for iWork and iMovie.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   You know, all this other stuff by not releasing that what they also allow to do is they can change anything in there anytime they need to as they need to.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And that flexibility allows them to innovate much faster.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Think about the trouble that Microsoft is having just getting people to move from Windows XP, a 48 year old operating system.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I think I think parts were written by Admiral Grace Hopper for God's sake.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Right.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Right.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   All right.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Moving along, I think you're doing a wonderful job of demolishing Mr. Kallikannis.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   It's an interesting discussion.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   We're not demolishing anybody.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It's a good discussion.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I think it's a good discussion.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   In fact, I'm glad Jason wrote the piece.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I have to say I've felt some of these things myself.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And in this one, I have to say I've really felt draconian app store policies that are frankly insulting.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   He says, "Like lemmings, we fell for your bar charts, extolling the openness of the iPhone app platform and its massive array of applications.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   We overpaid for your phone, which you render obsolete every 13 months like clockwork, and then signed our lives away to AT&T.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   The way you pay us back is by becoming the thought police deciding what applications we consume on the device we have overpaid for."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   That must be one hell of a rate plan.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   If you get one discount for a two year contract, what discount do you get for two years plus signing away your life?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Wow.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I didn't see that on the sign.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Did you use blood or apples justification?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Is they have to protect AT&T's network?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Oh, really?
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   All right.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   There are dozens and dozens of open phones on everyone's network.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   The network hasn't crashed yet.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   And even if someone did create a malicious iPhone app, you would know exactly who was running the application and be able to block and or turn off their phone.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   The network was made to deal with these issues on a network level who in their right mind feels they need to control the application level anyway.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   It's absurd.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   He says, "apples should have a basic system setting that says allow non-approved applications."
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   And you click this setting, a pop up could come on warning that if you click this setting, you're waving, you're previously understood customer service arrangement.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Well, I'm going to agree with this one because, of course, you could jailbreak your phone, but apples even said, "we don't think that's legal."
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   I mean, shouldn't I be able to put, I bought this hardware.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Shouldn't I be able to put anything I want on it?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   You know, I don't, I think that that, you know, you're, and I have to admit, as a Mac user, I know that I buy into whatever how Apple has to do this.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   What if they did this for the Mac?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   What if they said, "No, only approved applications could be used on the Mac?"
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   You'd be furious.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Yeah, I mean, it would, but the thing is, is that I also think as someone who's developing iPhone apps at the moment, you know, we pick things that we know that aren't, I mean, there are, there are so many opportunities to decide what kind of applications.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And we're talking about, you know, a handful of applications being turned down out of 10, 10,000.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   We don't know.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I mean, we don't, it could be many, many, many more.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   We don't know how many have been turned down.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   But certainly, if it was more than 1%, I'd be pretty surprised.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And Apple's absolutely free to do stupid and self-destructive things, just like we as consumers are absolutely free to take our business elsewhere.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Well, and that's what Jason's saying.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   He's not saying, "Change Apple is saying I'm taking my business elsewhere."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Okay, and that's, and where?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   That's fine.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I mean, it's a microsoft, apparently.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   It's just that there's language like, you know, well, they don't, I would love for every single company that's making phones, that's making computers, that's making operating systems, that's making software to absolute, obsolete everything that I'm using.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Don't do it every 18 months.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Do it every month.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Every month, come up with something that makes me think, "Oh, damn, this new computer that's out is so much better, so much more revolutionary than the one that I have right now.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I cannot believe that I have to wait another year before I can afford to replace the one that I just bought last month."
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   That is my definition paradise and four different syllables.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Well, Andy, what do you think about the notion that Apple's being a little overzealous in, shouldn't Apple just let any app you want?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   What about that idea of the checkbox?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   It says, "I'm waving my rights.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I'm going to use anything."
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Well, I mean, there are two different reasons why you have to get your kids vaccinated.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   One is to protect your kids and the other is to protect my kids.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   If you were to allow people to uncheck that box, does that allow people to say, "Well, great."
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Now the Hulu streaming app that allows people to exploit a hole to get past the 5GIG cap and now make it almost impossible for me to just get my email because so many people are keeping a live feed open between their iPhones and video service someplace else.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   That's the argument.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   That's the argument ISPs use to say you can't use BitTorrent.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   They know they can't get away with that because the cell phone industry is so monopolistic they seem to be able to get away with it there.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I think the problem here is that the iPhone is more of a computer than a cell phone and the practices of the old cell phone world are being pushed onto this computer.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I think one of the biggest tests for Apple is going to be when they're dealing with AT&T expires and they are free to make a deal with another phone company and come at them not as a computer company with no experience making cell phones that wants to enter this market with no power.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But someone's saying, "We have the single most popular smartphone hardware on the planet.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   We are willing to let that power make your company more profitable, give us the terms that we want."
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Remember, they were able to eventually get a lot of consensus from the music industry when they built the iTunes Store.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   If they make a deal with Verizon and suddenly as soon as that's done, the first five slides off of the announcement keynote are,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   "Here are things that we no longer have to deal with, no here are ways in which we were unsatisfied with the AT&T experience.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   We've heard you and we're responding."
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Number one is, "Now you can have any application you want.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Now you can have streaming video, pause, or pause, or pause, or pause."
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   If it's business as usual, they'll have the opportunity to make the statement that in truth we really don't care about the user experience that much
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   as long as it allows us to keep the relationship with our carrier.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And I think one of the things is different about an application on OS X and an application on the App Store is that Apple owns the App Store.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   By Apple owning the App Store, there is some stuff that's coming to come back to them if they're selling apps that are malicious, selling apps that do a lot of other things.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And that's the way they've set it up.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I don't really know if there's a way particularly out of that.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   When you buy an application, you can buy that application from anyone and then install it on your computer.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   And I think that that's a different relationship.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And I have to say, I look at Apple the same way I look at democracy.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   I think democracy is a horrible, inefficient, stupid way to run a government.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   It's just better than all the other options.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And so the thing is, is that it is...
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I think that Apple has a lot of things that I don't like about it.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   But when I look at all the other options, I'm just kind of like, well, where else am I really going to go?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   But that is a fairly lukewarm endorsement.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   What I'd say though is that Apple is...
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   It's not that Apple is anyone else's close in my eyes.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   It is, the iPhone is so much better than every...
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I literally, when I talked to people at it, I think of the time that I had before I had an iPhone as the time before time.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   It's completely like this other world that was horrible and ugly.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And I do so much with my iPhone.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It is so part of my reality that I can talk about not liking it, but it is...
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And I'm going to test some other phones this fall just to kind of play around.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   There's nothing else.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   There's nothing else.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   It really is true.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And it's so far ahead.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And so while I always said that I would never want Apple to be as big as Microsoft,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   I'd never want Apple to be more than 25% of the computer market because Steve Jobs is far more vicious than Bill Gates ever was.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And the thing is, if he was a big cat instead of a little cat, he would be far more dangerous.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And he'd be up against monopolies.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Isn't that what we're seeing here though, is that as he gets to be a bigger and bigger cat,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   we're seeing the Steve Jobs that you and I know is a killer?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Yeah, I mean, he's like, he may look like a little cat, but wouldn't he?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   It's kind of like one of those honey, honey, I try to begin.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Honey, I try the kids and you're suddenly small and there's big little animals that were in your house or big animals now.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And he's just, you know, he is very, very focused, very, very effective.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   He likes to win.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And he wants to win.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And so the thing is, is that I would never want to see Apple have more than, you know, a large portion of the computer market
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   because I know that we would be locked into all kinds of other things like that.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   The other two points of Jason's post are, and this is at calicannus.com, the case against Apple in five parts.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Really, they're only three parts because the other two parts are just variations on the third part.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Being a horrible hypocrite, but banning other browsers on the iPhone.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   For some reason, he's saying they should allow opera.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I just don't understand about that.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   I think it's more of a security and stability issue than anything else.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Safari works fine.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   I don't think we need internet explorer or...
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   I would like to see a better browser.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   What I would love is if Apple said, well, tell you what, here's WebKit for iPhone.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   If you build any browser that's based on WebKit, we will allow it.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   There you go.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And blocking the Google voice application on the iPhone, which again, is just another.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Now I have to say, the Google voice one is the first crack where I started going.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I really, you know, because the phone number on my business card is my Google voice number.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   It's not my straight, my direct number one.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   But you have that ring your iPhone, right?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   It does, but I would love to have it totally tied in.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   You know, and that's the thing that...
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Well, good news.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   David Pogue says that Google is going to write a Web app that does everything that it's
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Stanol and Apple is going to do.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And that'll put Apple's feet to the fire because Apple cannot fight that without kind of saying
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   we're in favor, we're against net neutrality, we're in favor of discrimination.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And I don't think Apple dares do that.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   You know, I'm sympathetic with what Jason's saying.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It's the plane of the broken hearted, the jilted.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   We've all been there.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   It doesn't...
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   It's...
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   You're right.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Where are you going to go?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   You're not going to go back to Microsoft?
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   He says, "I'm not a fan of government involvement in business, so I'd rather see Apple resolve these issues for themselves."
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Thank goodness he's not calling for the government to do something about it.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   In fact, he says, "I believe many forces are already at work."
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   With Michael Arrington of TechCrunch, Peter Rojas of GDGT coming out publicly against these very issues.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Neither of these two individuals will use an iPhone specifically because it isn't incompatible with their lives.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   I think it's a great political reasons.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Yeah, I'm not political enough about that.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   I think it's great that we talk about it.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   I think it's great that Apple gets pressed on it.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I think there's a lot of things they could do.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   I think one of the reasons we don't see any real innovation and how artists are towards a subscription model on iTunes or anything else is because Apple so far ahead.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I think that those are the kind of things that...
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   That's why we don't get some of the innovation that we get is because Apple so far ahead.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   I do think it's important that Apple gets pressed up against it.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   I want to say that.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   I do agree with Jason Calcanis for most of these things as far as these are a problem.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   But when he says that I'm going to go somewhere else, I kind of go, "Well, that's just getting crazy."
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   It's really the only place reasonably that you could go is Linux.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I think that's fine.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   I think a lot of people have done that.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   I think you can do that.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   It's only open source.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   It's not free software.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   I'm not caving to fascism by going into open source software.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Unless there are any...
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   This has software patents.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   This has copper.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Oh, for God's sake.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   No, no, no, we can't do that.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I think an Android phone with open source.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   No, I'm saying that there are people who...
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   When you make a political decision, when you make such a big decision based on politics,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   there's always going to be somebody who's saying, "I'm going to go for an open source phone
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   because I believe in freedom.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   I believe in artists' rights.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I believe in this.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   I believe in that."
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Then there will be someone at some conference who will treat your Google phone with disdain
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   because, again, if you really believed in freedom, you would not believe in any software
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   that uses any copyright of any kind.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   They're like, "Why are you using MP3 instead of Aug. 4?"
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   You do realize there's a patent associated with MP3 and patents are evil.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I mean, unless I find out that the iPhone is being assembled by little kids who are beaten
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   regularly, I would not be dropping my iPhone for a political reason.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   It would always be because for one reason or another, this phone is better than the iPhone.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   You know, the Google phone, I can see a future in which the Google phone is as good for me
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   as the iPhone is.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   If the right apps were to be released and if the operating system were continued to be
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   tweaked, it's making leaps and bounds.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And, again, there could be that time when if I have the choice between three different
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   companies on four different carriers and get exactly the hardware I want, exactly the software
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I want, and the ability to simply mount it as a USB-mass storage device and copy files
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   right into the media library, that would be tempting.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   He asks the final three questions.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And by the way, Daniel's in our chat room.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   I'm going to paraphrase him a little bit, says that when Apple says we are blocking this app
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   because it duplicates functionality are in the iPhone, he says the translation is,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   "Oh my God, they're doing something better than us.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Not allowed!"
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   These are the last three questions that Jason Calicanis asks.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   One, do you think Apple would be more or less successful if they adopted a more open strategy,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   for example, allowing other MP3 players to use iTunes like the Palm Pre?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   More or less successful?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   More successful, right?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I mean, how could that hurt them?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Well, here's the thing, though, is I think that part of the problem...
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   What are they afraid of?
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Well, I think part of the issue is that Apple is not...is a hardware company, not a software company.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   So, them selling more songs on iTunes means nothing to them.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   They make no money with the songs.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   So, the thing is that that tight integration with iTunes is what sells the hardware.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   The fact that the reason you get iLife with a Mac is because they're selling you hardware.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   No, I understand that.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   But I think that allowing other hardware to tie into it, I think, does undermine that easy...
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   That's an old school thought.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Oh boy, we better control this and keep anybody from doing it or they won't buy our product.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   In fact, we see time and time again in the marketplace that the people who win and people who generate goodwill
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   by doing things like being open, not by being draconianly restrictive.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   I can understand why Apple would be afraid of that, but boy, that's very old.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   That's an old school mentality, I think.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   But also, couldn't...I think the argument could be made that the reason why they're not going to say,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   "We will support every phone and every MP3 on the market," because that would get...
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Obligate them to supporting every phone and every...
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Well, they have to support it.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   They just don't have to block it.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Well, they're blocking the pre.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   But doesn't that...I really don't know how I feel about Palm being clever enough to figure out how to make the pre-presented
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   self-to-itunes as a syncable device.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   It's really philosophically, I think, that so long as Apple can simply say, "Oh, well, okay, if they want to be clever about that,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   we don't have DRM on this.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   They're not breaking our technology.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Of course, we're not going to support this in any way, shape, or form, and we reserve to write to accidentally break this
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   in a future release.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   On the other hand, you do know that that's going to be a question for the Genius Bar to answer once they hit.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Well, when I have to say that...
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   ...the 3.2 smart playlists.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Well, then the Genius says, "Sorry, you'll go ask Palm."
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   That's not our problem.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Well, I think the other thing is, is that I have to admit that I...
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   When I saw that a bunch of ex-Apple iPhone engineers who were obviously poached from Apple...
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   ...which is something you can't stop in California.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   So you can't have non-competes in California.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   So Palm took advantage of that and poached a bunch of engineers from Apple who then reverse-engineered,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   knowing what they know from Apple.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   They reverse-engineered a connection to iTunes.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   I have to admit that if I was Steve Jobs, I would cut them off just out of spite.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   That's probably exactly what happened.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   The thing is, it's just like, "Okay, you want to steal my engineers.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   You want to steal my engineers and backdoor into my application.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   I don't care who you..."
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   I'm going to cut you off at the knees just for doing that because that's the only legal thing
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   that Apple can do because there's no non-competent in California.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   So they can't be upset about them taking their engineers.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   They can't be upset about them only taking advantage of the fact that only those engineers would know how to do this.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Yeah, no, I understand why Steve's pissed off.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   It would be smart for him to hold his nose.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   I would do it just out of spite.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Hold his nose.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Yeah, I know you would.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   And spite is not probably the best.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   I'll just say that.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   I'm just saying that, but I'm saying that Palm, it is gray to me what they did.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   There are Linux players that sync with iTunes.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And Apple's not blocking.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And Apple's not blocking.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I think that what Palm did to get it done is slightly underhanded.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   They're basically, it's not like, "Oh, we just kind of logged into it."
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Yeah, it's so announced it as a feature.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   It's cheeky.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Which is a little cheeky.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   So the thing is, they got cheeky and Apple slapped them around.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   They slapped the cheek.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   You know, that's the thing is that that's in my opinion.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Do you think Apple...
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Number two, these are the questions that...
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Three questions from Jason Calicana's.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Do you think Apple should face serious antitrust action?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   No.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Yeah, I'm not a lawyer.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Yeah, I think that Apple would if they got bigger.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   The real issue of antitrust is you have to be a monopoly before you can be in trouble for
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   any trust violation.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   And you'd have to show a market that they actually dominate.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Yeah, they don't dominate.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Well, if I dominate the iPod market.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Well, iPod...
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   That's their own market.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I mean, the thing is, I think they have to show that they dominate the music market.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   But the problem is, is that you've got Amazon with a successful sales pipeline.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   It's true.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   When you actually look at the percentage of total sales of songs, you're not getting into
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   the size that it would require...
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I mean, they are the number one seller, but they're not majority...
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   I'm not 90% the market.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   They're not even selling.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   They're not more than 50% of the market.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.200]   Apple's big problem though is that you can get drunk once or twice, but once you get a
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.000]   reputation as a drunk, you just got to move to a new town.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.600]   That's true.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   And that's Apple's problem.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.080]   If they get the reputation as we are the company that will remove features that are
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.880]   really, really cool because we don't control them, that's going to be a hard thing for
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   them to overcome in the future.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.880]   Cool.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.720]   And that's what you're seeing here, by the way, is that they're starting to get that
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720]   reputation.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   And I think that's more of the danger for Apple is that they become the next Microsoft.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.120]   You know, before they were the little guys, the rebel that everyone...
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.720]   The question is, is when do they switch from being the woman who's throwing the hammer
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.800]   to the guy on the screen?
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.040]   And they are closing in on that precipice very quickly.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.040]   Final question.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:25.160]   And of course, the modern version of that commercial, all the mindless drones would
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.160]   turn on that woman and just...
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.200]   Just like ever bound up and thrown out of the building.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   You broke RTV!
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.200]   How dare you!
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.800]   Don't be a hater!
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.360]   Question three, do you...
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:42.120]   Now this is, I think the question really for you guys, and I think the ultimate question.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.680]   Do you think Apple's dexterity and competence forgive their bad behavior?
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.920]   That's kind of what you're saying, Alex.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.920]   I think it is.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.400]   I mean, for me, you know, it's...
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.600]   And I think that their bad behavior hasn't gotten to a point where I'm...
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.720]   That I think it's egregious.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.600]   I think that it is troublesome.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.040]   It is troubling.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.480]   And it's something I think they need to look at.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.640]   I don't think it's gotten to the point where I just go, "It's so bad.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.800]   I'm gonna move on."
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.320]   And I do think that, as I said, I'm very practical of, "I need this stuff to work today."
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.680]   It's part of my pipeline.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.080]   And I'm not really ready to...
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.600]   I definitely forgive Apple.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   And from what I see from Snow Leopard, I really forgive them.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.600]   I mean, I can...
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.200]   From a blather earlier about, "Oh, I don't do things for political reasons."
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.760]   The fact remains that a factory in my decision to buy a mini-tell MIFI instead of waiting
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.720]   for iPhone, Tether, was that, "Look, I've had it with being jerked around by AT&T.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.720]   I've had it...
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   No, tell them that it's gonna come, but I'm not gonna...
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.480]   I can tell you when or how much."
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.240]   But they came down to the fact that I was incredibly impressed with the MIFI.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.640]   It wasn't that I made a political statement by moving to a different solution.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.040]   It was that here is a company that came up with a really great solution that AT&T was
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.960]   merely, you know, just stipulating towards.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.840]   And again, there could be a time when Apple is facing exactly that sort of a problem
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.640]   where, again, the Google phone is gonna be so...
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.360]   Really, really cool.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.000]   And this is gonna be those four applications that we all wish were supported on the iPhone.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.480]   And we know that we're on the store for about two weeks before they're pulled down.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.920]   Then that's gonna make people say, "You know what?
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.120]   We're not gonna wait for Apple to come up with an answer and tell us why they're pulling
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.120]   down these applications.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.120]   We've had it.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.120]   We're just gonna move now."
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.760]   A year from now, a great Android phone that hooked me in with Google Voice would be...
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   And I could be honest, I could be.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.760]   I could be.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.760]   I could be.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.760]   I'm rooting for him.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.760]   But I am like Alex Torres.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   Did you see?
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   This is actually...
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.760]   I'm sorry, Andre Torres.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.360]   He's the chief technology officer for Federated Media Web Designer.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.000]   He was going to switch to the G1 for one month.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.780]   He says, "I give up after seven days.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.240]   I thought it'd be fun to see what life was like on a different platform.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.340]   I think I've seen more than enough on this hardware.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.960]   The device is too slow to get anything done.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.120]   That was kind of my problem.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:00.400]   I found myself not going to the phone when in a situation where I used to check my mail
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400]   and catch up on Twitter.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.240]   I stood in line at the ATM and just didn't bother."
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.880]   That's what happens.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.320]   You want to like this phone for political reasons.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.000]   It's just not there yet.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.360]   I'm rooting for it.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.560]   Maybe the new handset, is it my touch?
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.560]   I'd love to see someone.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.720]   Oh, he's got a my touch.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.720]   That's the my touch.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.200]   The new version, the latest version of the operating system which has a virtual onscreen
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.760]   keyboard was one of the major complaints that I had.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.320]   I believe it also has.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.840]   It's an HTC phone.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840]   It's a lot slicker.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.840]   It's a lot cooler looking.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.840]   It's a saster.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.840]   It's a lot thinner.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.640]   I haven't done a speed test on it.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.720]   I believe that it is faster than the previous one.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.000]   It's not a land speed record setter.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.200]   Again, there are things that can be done when you have not just one company that's
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.720]   hiding the hardware future of a platform, but companies that have been making phones
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.840]   for about 10 years deciding, "Okay, let's take this really great technology.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.440]   We're working on a different project."
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.280]   Now let's put it into this really cool Google phone instead.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.640]   In battery life, it's pretty new.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.640]   It's pretty new.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.320]   Unfortunately, it was waiting for me when I come back from China.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.320]   I've only started really using it for the past four or five days.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.360]   I'm not really ready to give any performance stuff on it.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:20.760]   Again, it's phones like these that make me think I'm really keen on keeping an eye on
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.640]   the Google phone market.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.000]   This reminds me of everything that I liked about the first one.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.400]   On that list of few things that I didn't like about the first one, "Wow, you've just
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.160]   gotten rid of that, that, that."
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   That's interesting.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:38.600]   If I could buy and unlock one of these, if that were just a simple, straightforward
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:44.400]   option, it would be completely unlocked Google phone versus an iPhone.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.840]   It's still not a terribly close race, but it's the sort of thing that the fact that I'm
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.600]   stopping and considering it would be, that's an interesting data point, I think.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:58.920]   I was mad when Apple decided, I was one of the people who really said Apple should have
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:04.400]   made this an open phone, just a GSM phone, and sold it as a piece of hardware, and not
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.800]   done a deal with the phone companies.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.200]   I think, yeah, they made a lot of money, but I think it was a bad mistake.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.440]   I still feel that way.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.720]   I think they really should have sold this as a hardware device.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.640]   Nokia sells its phones that's open, can be used with anything.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.640]   I think they would have done much better.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.800]   I think that one of the things that hurts a lot of these phones is that they...
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   Look at the subsidies.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   Well, it hurts them.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.600]   Well, no, it's not just subsidy, because Apple, when they originally sold it, didn't
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.880]   sell it with a subsidy.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   That's true.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.840]   Look how much better it's selling now, though.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:40.480]   Yeah, but I think that what Apple got was they got to control how that phone was going
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.080]   to be used to a fair bit, way more than Nokia does.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.480]   One of the problems is that a lot of these phones in the United States are crippled by
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.480]   the phone companies.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.480]   So we talk about...
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.480]   But if you buy a Nokia...
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:55.080]   And the problem is it's very expensive, but if you buy it in '97, unlocked $700, there's
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.080]   no crippling.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.400]   You can do anything you want with it.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.840]   You put a SIM chip in from AT&T or T-Mobile, and it does anything you want it to do.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.120]   And I think Apple was greedy here.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.840]   I think Apple said, "Well, look, all the money we can make if we do a deal with AT&T,"
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.720]   and it's true, it was very successful for them.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.320]   I've set up...
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:17.520]   I've set up unlock phones for different networks, and sometimes it really is...
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.880]   It's difficult enough that I have to go...
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.680]   I have to drill so deep down into so many different message boards to find the network
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   addresses I need to get certain digital features working.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.960]   Well, believe me, if an iPhone were unlocked, you wouldn't have to drill down anywhere.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.680]   You'd be able to get all that information very quickly.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:38.160]   Well, can you come on T-Mobile wanting to help an iPhone be more successful on their network?
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   Or...
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.880]   I mean, if Apple were created enough to simply say, "Guys, here is the spec for our phone
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.320]   and how to put it on your digital network."
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.760]   If you want to build custom iPhone data packages, by all means go out and do that.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.040]   We're not in the phone business, but here's how to make our users want to use your service
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.720]   instead of somebody else's.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.680]   And I think the problem is you end up with a non-uniform experience.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.640]   And I think that that's what Apple tends to try to avoid.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.400]   That's the butter that Apple spreads over.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:11.760]   Every one of its monopolistic practices is, "Well, this is how we get a uniform experience."
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:17.480]   Well, I just know all I know is that 90% as a software developer, 90%, 10% of our software
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.960]   was sold to Windows when we were selling it to Windows.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.000]   And 90% of our tech support was Windows.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.680]   And it was like a...
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.880]   It was this goo of tar every time someone called from Windows because, "Okay, so what
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.400]   video card are you using?
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.080]   What CPU are you using?
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.080]   What kind of hard drives are you using?
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   What version of the opera?"
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.080]   It was like there's a thousand different things that I have to deal with that have been...
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.720]   But this is a phone and you're not going to have to deal with any of that?
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:44.160]   Well, but the thing is is that if these different companies, as I said, the average person is
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.920]   not going to buy an unlocked phone.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.360]   So 99% of the phones would be bought by people who...
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.360]   1% of the people...
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.200]   That's because the unlocked phones have been phones.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   I think this is...
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.200]   I'll be...
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:01.400]   We have a chance with this tablet, Apple, to release it unlocked.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.880]   Anybody can buy it, tie it to whatever carrier they want.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.520]   Don't you think it'd be better that way?
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.360]   I don't think they'll do it though.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.160]   So also, doesn't this have the opportunity to really change the way that people buy their
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.280]   services from some side of the companies?
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.080]   If we start to create an assumption that, look, this is going to be exactly like the
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.080]   way you buy computers.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.080]   You buy a computer from whoever you want and then you go into any phone store and say,
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.600]   "Hi, I would like to buy a contract for service for writing."
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.600]   Yes.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.920]   And then simply say, "Great, here's a sim chip."
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   Yes.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.920]   Yes.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.120]   That's how they do it in many countries, not here.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.120]   Well done here.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.120]   But I think that...
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.600]   And I do agree with that, but I think that in the United States, the problem is the
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.640]   iPhones have sold way more since they started being subsidized.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.600]   So the argument you can make is that Apple made a lot more money than Sw
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   in it.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.120]   Well, not only did they make a lot more money, but they made a much larger market penetration
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.480]   since it was subsidized.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:55.920]   So since the price went down to $99 for a 3G iPhone, now everybody and their brother
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.920]   has an iPhone.
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.440]   And so the thing is, is when you talk about market penetration, at $99, and the reality
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.040]   is, is that if AT&T was thinking this all the way out, they would do the same thing
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.560]   they do with the other phones, which is they would give you the iPhone and let you pay
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.880]   your subscription to it, let you just walk away with it.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:18.400]   Maybe say, for $10 more a month for the first year, you can just have the iPhone, you can
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.720]   just walk away with the iPhone with no money down, and they would just continue to make
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.800]   that market penetration.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:27.280]   And so the thing is, is that Apple is owning this market because of the subsidies.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.560]   And so the thing is, is that while we can say that that first trial was successful to some
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.160]   degree, they sold a lot of iPhones.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.400]   What they sold in that revolutionary, we're going to sell it at retail, you know, without
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:43.960]   any subsidies was trumped completely by the by the numbers that were created by the subsidized
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.440]   phones, except that if you add up the actual cost of subsidized phone.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.440]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.680]   A lot more.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.640]   But nobody knows that or thinks about it.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.640]   What is the same?
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.640]   You're not paying the subsidized phone.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.240]   Well, it's the subsidized phone is the same price to you.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.960]   It's just that you were paying the retail and then you're paying the subscription.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.560]   Now you're paying less and you're still paying the subscription.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.080]   And so you're, it's, I think if it's an unlocked phone, you probably don't get to charge these
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.160]   premium prices on the subscription.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.000]   Maybe I mean, you know, but if you have an exclusive to set to charge those premium
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   prices.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.560]   But, but the, the, I guess what I would say is that the, by the way they do sell the iPhone
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.440]   that way in other countries, they have to.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.160]   Well, the average person though, in Australia, you have a choice of a number of people.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.280]   How many people though do we know by unlocked phones in the United States?
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.760]   They all buy them subsidized.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.360]   You know, 99.9% of the population buys a subsidized phone.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.040]   They buy it without thinking about it because it's not as much money upfront.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.680]   They don't do the math of what the, you know, the reason that I buy a 32 gig iPhone, I was
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.520]   talking about, you know, in line with someone when I bought it, I was like, the, the cost,
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.280]   the difference between the, the 16 and the 32 is a little shaving off of the cost of
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.040]   my, of my total, you know, ownership cost of that phone.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.280]   You know, it just doesn't matter.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.640]   I might as well get the 32 gig.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.240]   And I think it's 60% of the people are buying 32 gigs because they, because it's just, it
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.360]   doesn't make enough of a difference.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.640]   You know, and so the thing is, is that so when we talk about this, it'd be great to
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   have an open phone.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:07.880]   We're talking about 0.1% at most of the people who buy the phone would buy an unlocked phone.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.280]   Everyone else would buy a subsidized phone, which has certain features cobbled because
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.720]   that's what they're doing to all these phones.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.760]   U S met U S carriers.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   They cut off this.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   They cut off that.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.760]   They turn this off.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   They turn this off.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.240]   You know, and there's all these hacks for your Motorola phone.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.920]   There's all these hacks for the other stuff to turn on what the manufacturer created.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.040]   And so the thing is, is that the, you know, the, you know, the thing is that that's what
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.840]   would happen if Apple opened it up.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.440]   It would just be, it would be cobbled in six, it would be cut up into six different ways
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.920]   of using the phone across all these carriers.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.640]   And it would really be a mess for them, in my opinion.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.640]   That's the problem.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.640]   All right.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.640]   That's my two cents.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   That's my story.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.640]   I, yeah, it's a great discussion.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.320]   And I thank Jason for, for prompting it.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.640]   And Jason is not available.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.440]   We would have, I would have called him and got him in on this, but we'll have him on
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.440]   a Twitter or something.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.280]   And we'll talk about it because I think it's a relevant conversation.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.000]   But I think you guys addressed it appropriately.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.800]   We're going to talk about a new iTunes.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.960]   It might be more social.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.000]   This is an interesting direction for Apple in just a second.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.600]   But first I want to tell you about the Drobo Pro.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:13.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, Drobo Pro.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.000]   We have a new discount on the Unbundled Drobo and the Drobo Pro just for you.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.120]   The Drobo, of course, you've got to know about by now.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.520]   We've talked, gosh knows, we've talked about it an awful lot.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:30.720]   That is the device that allows you to store an awful lot of data on a firewire or USB
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.880]   connection for drives in redundant arrays so that it's not right.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.400]   It's better than RAID because you can mix and match drive sizes.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.200]   And if one drive fails, it doesn't matter.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.200]   You don't lose a bit of data.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.960]   You just pop it out, put another one in.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:49.800]   In fact, the Drobo will tell you if your total array size is getting full, it says, here's
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   the smallest drive.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.080]   You want to pop in a new one?
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.440]   I've done this so many times.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.440]   It's great.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:59.120]   You take out that I had 160 gig drive in there, put in a terabyte drive, rebuild itself, all
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.560]   of a sudden your Drobo is even bigger.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.560]   That's a great start.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:08.120]   But now for those of you who want even more capacity, the Drobo Pro goes to eight disks.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.200]   You don't have to fill them all up, but you can go up to eight disks with this.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.840]   That means you can lose as many two drives and still not lose a bit of data.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.720]   They've got the new ISCSI interface using Gigabit Ethernet very fast, very easy to set
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.720]   up.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:27.760]   I mean, it's just the monster Drobo, the giant Drobo, the Drobo, people like Alex Lindsay
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.680]   need to start stuff on.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.320]   Works well with a single machine or on the network.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.040]   You can use a virtual server environments like VMware, Virtual Iron Zen or Microsoft's
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.360]   Hyper-V.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.880]   You can even host your virtual machines directly on the Drobo.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.560]   It's nice to have all that space.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.720]   Microsoft Small Business Server works with Best Breakthrough Product by the judges at
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.720]   TechEd.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:56.800]   Now, I want you to go to Drobo.com/macbreak to see the new instant rebates.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.320]   I like instant rebates because I never send in rebake coupons.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.320]   50.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.320]   Do you?
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.320]   No, I never do.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.320]   I know that.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   That's why they do that.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.080]   Instant rebates is a company saying no.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.080]   We know you're not going to send it in.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.680]   We're going to give it to you right up front.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.320]   $50 off Drobo and Drobo bundles starting at $349 after instant rebate.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.160]   You got it like that.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:21.040]   $75 off the Drobo Pro and Drobo bundles.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.560]   And the instant rebates through the end of the month, August 31st, so get going right
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.480]   now to DROBO.com/macbreak.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:33.840]   As someone who has many Drobo's, do you know how you feel after you put all your data
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   on a Drobo?
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.040]   Does this joke feel very droopy feeling?
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.880]   I think I have a feeling droopy.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.880]   Where's my feeling droopy jingle?
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.760]   Oh, here it is.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:49.880]   DROBODROBO, DROBO, DROBO, DROBO, DROBO, VELANDROOB.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.640]   Paul Minshaw.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.160]   That's great.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:45:00.400]   All right, this is, I don't know, you know, I have the time on this show because Apple
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.080]   isn't announcing something every three days.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:06.560]   We talk about rumors a lot and I'm always have mixed feelings with rumors.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.160]   But I'm, you know, I guess it's okay to talk about a rumor as long as you bracket it in
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.040]   Big Red headline.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.240]   This is a rumor.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.680]   This comes from nine to five Mac.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.400]   iTunes nine images emerge.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:27.200]   A German blogger has found some images of I-29 on a Chinese forum.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.200]   Oh, dear.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   I heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.280]   This is getting worse.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.720]   Who knows?
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   I don't know.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:40.200]   The skills to tell whether these are Photoshop or not.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.040]   Boy Genius report has the original story nine to five saying, wait, no, no, we don't
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.040]   believe this.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.680]   But there is a now under under in the playlist section there under genius.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.520]   There's now something called social.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.320]   You know, this would if they're not doing it, they ought to do it.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:01.680]   What your friends are listening to, what your look says, there's a one click purchase
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.760]   in there.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.760]   That's interesting.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:09.480]   It would make sense for what kind of social features would you build in the iTunes?
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.280]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.920]   Oh, Mr. Qatar.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   Yes.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.800]   So the thing that I've always wanted to see in iTunes or any social kind of media thing
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:24.840]   is to be able to, for me as a user to have some control over it where I go, okay, so
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.080]   look at my library and anybody who's willing to share their library, you know, whatever,
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.560]   the genius stuff that they've done in the past.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.280]   And like all I want is two little scroll bars.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:40.800]   One scroll bar is find people who have a core, a certain percentage of correlation
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.200]   between my library and their library.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:51.800]   So if 60% of my library is the same as 60% of their library, when 60% of that group picks
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.320]   a song, let me know what that is.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.680]   You know, so the thing is, and if I had two scroll bars, that's all I would need to be
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.520]   able to do that to decide what, like, so I, like, so I build my little pool by, you know,
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.800]   by increasing what that, that, how big that pool is by what the correlation is.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.840]   It might be only 10% or 20% or 30% or 50% and it would show me, like, you know, you've
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:14.920]   connected with 600 people or whatever and then say when half of those people or 30%
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.960]   of those people or whatever have picked a song, you know, downloaded a song or have a
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:23.960]   song in their library, let me know what that is so that I can listen to it.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:28.400]   And I think that this gets to a point where you have this kind of cloud of, I think you
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.600]   have Facebook integration, if you had all your Facebook friends and their, their iTunes
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.640]   or feeding their Facebook account with, but I'm more interested in picking all that information
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   would be there.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.360]   I guess I'm more interested in picking people who like the same music and that aren't necessarily
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.360]   my friends.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   I don't want to be their friend.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.360]   I just want to know what they're listening to.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.400]   I, I kind of like the randomness.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.360]   The, the coolest thing about back in the, back in the days when we had our music on one device
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:56.360]   or phone generator device, sometimes, like, we do my friends would do things like this.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.360]   We just like swap iPods for a week.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.360]   Oh man, that's awesome.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.360]   And so you get this, you get this.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.360]   That's a great idea.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.720]   And now you get like a week's worth of music that you never chose, that you haven't, that
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.560]   are based on another person's life on another person's taste.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:12.120]   And almost always you would find a damn number of songs that be, that you become immediate,
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.600]   immediate, huge fans of.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.960]   Um, every now and then I'll go on Twitter and I'll simply say, okay, I need to buy some
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.120]   more music, recommend a song to me.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.880]   And I'll get 200 or 300 recommendations.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.880]   And then that will lead to such an outlay of cash.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:28.360]   Because I'll find something that I would never have, based on my own pace, I find a lot of
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.000]   music that I like and that that leads to other music that I like.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.240]   But what I really want is that total bit of randomness to say.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.960]   And here's, here's, let me teleport you into another part of the iTunes store that you
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:43.400]   would never have hit otherwise and show you something that's really, really great.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:49.400]   I think, but social features, I mean, Alex, you have just one way of doing that.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.800]   Yeah, I think I mean, I would have Zoon's got social.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:49:00.400]   Well, even if all, if all they did was add, uh, global genius recommendations and global
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:06.040]   genius information just to smart playlists and allow that to be a feature of the iTunes
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:10.800]   store, not just the local playlist, simply say, not just show me tunes, show me music
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.720]   that has been chosen by people who share 60% of my taste in music.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:19.400]   And then another line saying, and music that they, those people have played at least two
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.100]   times in the past week, as opposed to, uh, damn, what did I buy this with this Richard
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.600]   Kylie Beatles song?
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   I do that.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.600]   That was funny.
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.240]   No, I do that on friend feed with the, with likes and comments.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.440]   I say, you know, it's a good way to surface news.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.440]   It seems like this would be a good way to surface.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.280]   Well, I think that my idea is not just for music.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.280]   I think it could be news.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.280]   It could be video, you can have a friend feed searches says, you know, I want stories from,
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.800]   from these 20 people that more than five people have said, I like this story, which means
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.960]   is in friend feed parlance is pay attention to this.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.960]   Right.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.400]   And it really surfaces great stuff, you know, right.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.640]   And that the music could easily benefit.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   Do you guys use the genius?
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   Do you like the genius?
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   It's a lot.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.640]   Especially when I'm driving.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.520]   Well, especially when I'm driving, because I have that my iPhone, my dashboard mount,
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:09.120]   I've already blown through all my podcasts.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.800]   I haven't chosen my audible for the month yet.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.920]   And so by all this music that let sit in playlists, I've pretty much already figured
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:24.280]   out it's so easy to pull over at a designated rest stop, put the car into turn the key off
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   the ignition because of course you do not operate your iPhone in this fashion.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.160]   All the car is in motion.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.240]   Choose one song that you like.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.240]   Choose genius.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:38.800]   Then boom, you're off and running with the rhythm really usually a pretty spot on playlist.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:43.080]   One of the great things about having 16 gigs and now 32 gigs in your iPhone is that you
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:47.080]   can now have music on that phone that you haven't listened to in a long, long time.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:52.960]   I have a smart playlist whose only job it is to it's like, please find for me five gigabytes
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:58.400]   worth of music that I have not played in the past two months, especially in another play
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:02.160]   that says, show me music that I've rated at four stars or greater that I can listen to
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.640]   in the past two months.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:08.120]   And so now all this stuff keeps getting churned up from the bottom of my music playlist.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:12.520]   And so genius is an easy way to get that stuff into the foreground without having to sit
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:17.880]   in a house and how many hours have you spent like a course of a given week saying, okay,
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.600]   well, my old road trip playlist is not good enough or my old workout play.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.160]   Okay, so drag, drag, drag.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.160]   I don't know.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.160]   Scrolling about zippers.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.360]   Okay, two songs from there.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.200]   Oh, God, I need something to flow here.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.840]   Well, how about, you know, genius.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.840]   That's what it's supposed to do.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.800]   And I think social to that though would make it really.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:39.520]   Yeah, I have to admit my problem is is that I'm as a former DJ, I'm usually really touching
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.320]   about what song goes after the next song.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.320]   Oh, no.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.320]   Put play it.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.320]   You have to play this with segues.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.320]   I know I don't.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.920]   That's a whole nother story about what I want from iTunes, but I don't.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.480]   I don't have a I do I used to make mixes with play with things, but while I'm saying that's
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.560]   like making a mix tape, but I think that one song certain songs, then you want other songs
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.520]   that come after those and then you have to decide how many fast ones to how many slow
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.000]   ones and how many make you think versus how many you pay attention to your play list.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.680]   So like I so like when I have like a barbecue, there's like a three hour process before,
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.120]   you know, before a barbecue that is just building the barbecue mix that's going to
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.400]   go for six hours, you know.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.480]   So so for me, I have all these playlists and we have a we use one of the last years.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.480]   I still do it.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   That's that was part of why I love iTunes is because it's so easy for me.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   It does make it really easy.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.520]   I have, you know, 160 gigs of music to pick from and I and I sit there and I have an,
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.280]   you know, an iPod, the classic iPod that's just packed.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:30.320]   And so I, you know, I have every song I've ever owned, you know, on that on that iPod.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.280]   And so I can sit there and just make these crazy mixes, you know, however I, however I
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   feel.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:41.320]   I would love social features that you know, just impossible to do because the RIAA, I
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:45.760]   was the diner a few days ago having breakfast and, you know, of course, in case you drop
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:50.240]   a quarter to the little jukebox, that's an area or dining and you select, you know,
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.760]   okay, Patsy Klein, okay, a really good Elvis song and now what's the, and now there you
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   go.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.760]   Alvin and the chipmunk.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   Let's really invite everybody inside the diner.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.760]   It is fun, isn't it?
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.120]   And I thought that wouldn't be great if there was some sort of open standard that simply
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.480]   said that I can allow the, by virtue of the fact that I have a phone that has both Wi-Fi
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:13.680]   and a music library, I can sort of simply add music stream from the pool into the music
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:18.880]   feature of the music, the music service of this establishment and simply.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.840]   So as you're dining, you can basically be listening to a constant stream of music contributed
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.440]   by people who are actually there and actually dining.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.680]   And it would be simple.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.800]   It would be simple to run the person who runs the place, which would have essentially a
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:35.280]   black list or essentially a smart playlist console that simply says, allow any music
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.520]   that's of this genre that is specifically rated as not being explicit as being okay for,
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.080]   you know, that's okay for common listening.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.720]   Don't allow music of certain genres.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.320]   It would be an interesting social thing.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:55.120]   And also the reflex of that would be that every device that works with the standard
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.040]   would also have the ability to simply say, you know, put me into a mode that always has
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   the current song, the current album art, and then buy it on iTunes link on my screen.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.840]   So if they listen to a song that I actually like, I can say, we say, great, I'd like to
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.840]   buy that too.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:11.840]   I mean, all these, all, when you talk about social features, it's not just about, I would
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:15.440]   love to be able to tweet the song that I'm listening to along with an iTunes store purchase
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.800]   link that gives me a kick back to actually buy things.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   That would be nice too.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.760]   But there's so many things that are possible that would lead to really great exploration
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.640]   of music that I'm sure that for legal reasons, the recording can chew at never a level.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:34.400]   Yeah, I'm sure they're, I'm sure they're esteemed that I put my five, I swapped five
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.040]   big iPods with Bob Lavite is probably hate that.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.640]   Well, they're probably going to ask me for $8 and fines, you know, that's not your music.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.680]   Well, I think that your music, I think that this gets back into when you talk about the
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.960]   social stuff, this is the, and I, again, I think that Apple is one of the only people
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.520]   that could really, or one of the only companies that could really take this on is, is the
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:57.800]   subscription service really makes sense in a social area where, you know, if I paid $20
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:02.480]   a month or $15 a month to have access to all the songs so that if someone is listening
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.800]   to something and my social network tells me I should listen to it, I can listen to it.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.040]   That artist is getting money for it because that thing is being played.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.680]   I'm not paying anything extra for it.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.000]   It's part of my subscription.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.640]   You know, and that's where all of that, that subscription service totally makes sense.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.640]   And it can be, I don't really care.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.640]   It can be DRM 128 bit.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:24.760]   If I want to buy the song, I can buy it a DRM free 256, you know, and, but I can fill
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:29.160]   up my iPod with things that my social network has told me I, that is good.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.400]   You know, and, and I think that that is, and I think it would be a huge boom for the music
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400]   industry.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:37.600]   I think it would be an, an, an, and adding that social networking that, that either I
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:42.240]   talked about or Andy talked about and the subscription service would basically be the
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:46.520]   final nuke that wiped out all competition for Apple.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:51.360]   I mean, you know, like that, that combination would be the end of every other player, every
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.740]   other music service, every other, you know, which is the only reason the music industry
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:58.920]   wouldn't do it is it would, it would end everything because it's so, it's such a, you
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.480]   mix the two of those together.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:05.880]   And I think that how do you compete with a better player, a better hardware device and
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:06.880]   too much power.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.360]   It would be the only reason they would stop it is because now the thing is the music industry
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.400]   would make more money than they've ever made because all the people to be paying subscriptions
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:17.420]   because Apple users have proven that they're willing to just pay for things being convenient.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:20.660]   So they'd make a lot of money, but they wouldn't have any, but their business would be owned
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.660]   by Apple.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:26.960]   Jason Calicanis, AT&T and all the rest of us should just bow down to the inevitable.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.960]   Salute our Apple overlords.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.960]   Right.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:31.960]   Because we'll just all.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:36.000]   Without feeling lead to Apple, Apple has a wonderful plan for your life.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.960]   You will give yourself the Apple willing.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:42.200]   But I think that, but I think that the reason that Apple has this is because they're paying
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.280]   far more attention to the user experience.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.240]   You know, and I think that that's the, that, then everyone else.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.760]   I mean, these other phones that why don't we like these other phones is because they're
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.760]   hard to use.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:54.780]   It doesn't take much more attention to the user experience to be these other guys.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:55.780]   Well, that's the whole thing.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.780]   They're paying no attention to the user experience.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:01.660]   You know, that's the, and I was explaining this to someone who was a PC software developer
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.300]   that was moving to the Mac and they showed me their first version and it just looks like
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.300]   a PC interface.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.500]   And I was like, this isn't going to go anywhere on a Mac because I mean, I get that you can
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.860]   do this on a PC because they don't care because they're not used to that.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.580]   But Mac users are going to be like, eh, this is too hard.
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.940]   It's too hard because that button, that button is just, it's hard to push.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.700]   You know, it's just, it's, it's like a quarter inch, too thin.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.080]   You know, and that's an awful long distance for me to move the mouse pointer.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.640]   Quarter inch is everything.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   All right.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.440]   One more story that we're going to get to our picks of the week.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.440]   Good news.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.500]   If you don't like a glossy screen, Apple has announced a matte option for the 15 inch power
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.800]   book was available for the 17 inch sheet of body.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:39.800]   What are you laughing at?
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.960]   No, I'm just saying it's like for $50.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.040]   Like a slightly abrasive pot of sandpaper.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.400]   It's like, yeah, you could do the same thing.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.000]   Now, not your laptop is perfect because it's not glossy anymore.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.620]   I've come to love the glossy screen, I must say.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:53.620]   I hate it.
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:54.620]   You hate it.
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.580]   So now you can get a 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.300]   You lose your borderless infinity bezel.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.940]   You get the lousy silver bezel, but you could paint that.
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.540]   I'm actually rat tech sent me.
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:05.940]   I haven't put it on yet, but right.
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:06.940]   50 bucks.
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.620]   They sent me a little, a little sticker that I can put, you know, like a matte sticker that
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.620]   I'm going to run on.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.620]   Oh, it goes on top of it.
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.620]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:16.740]   And then, and then I'll be, you're a professional photographic, you're in a studio or outside
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:18.820]   on a shoot and you can't see your screen.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:19.820]   That's a problem.
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:20.820]   It's his a problem.
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:21.820]   He kills.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:22.820]   He kills.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:23.820]   He uses just aren't happy.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.560]   They want to be able to see their screen.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   It's crazy.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.560]   You know, it's just fine.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.200]   It's much easier to hit that little button.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.720]   That was a quarter inch, you know, too small.
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.160]   I want those premium laptops.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.160]   If you want everything.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.640]   Oh, wait, this is a premium laptop.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.440]   Ooh, I like glossy, but I shiny objects.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.120]   I just like shiny objects.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:46.200]   It's rare that I find myself in a situation where I can simply adjust the screen so that
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.680]   the glare isn't a problem.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:52.580]   But nonetheless, it's their situations where it's like, okay, well, I suppose if I, I suppose
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:57.860]   if I'd spent $600 for a notebook instead of 1600, I could sit and use it wherever I wanted,
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:01.300]   but I suppose there's some features you just can't have for $1600, such as sitting wherever
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.300]   the hell you want.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.300]   Okay.
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.300]   This is an Apple story.
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.500]   I'm going to throw it in here and give you an update.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:11.460]   A friend feed was sold yesterday to Facebook for $45 million in stock.
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.660]   We think $45 million in stock and cash.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:17.640]   Friend feed is the, is my preferred social network.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:18.640]   Wow.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.220]   A lot of friend feeders, screaming bloody murder, saying what's going to happen to friend feed?
[00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:27.800]   No word, whether it'll continue as is seems unlikely, seems like Facebook will kind of
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:32.400]   merge some of those features into a Facebook and already that people are scrambling around
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.920]   to find a replacement for friend feed.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   Wow.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:39.720]   But the friend feed folks say to their credit, you know, we, we love our community and we're
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.960]   not going to do anything to harm you.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.080]   We'll, we'll figure out a solution here.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.660]   I have asked Paul Buhight, the, one of the founders of a friend feed to join us on this
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:47.900]   week in Google on Saturday.
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.020]   He says scheduled permitting, he will.
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.180]   So he'll give you an update on that.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:55.860]   It's not really a Mac story, but I just thought I throw it in there.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.420]   Um, let's see.
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:00.900]   Do you have any other stories before we go to our picks of the week, gentlemen?
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:03.540]   Anything else you think is of grave importance?
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.540]   I think so.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.140]   No, no, it's kind of a slow week, to be honest.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.140]   That's why we gave Jason.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.580]   I would like, I would like to eat some crow.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.580]   Uh oh.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.620]   I thought that I thought we'd have a new snow leopard this week, but we don't.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.140]   Oh yeah, you were pretty convinced.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.060]   So now I'm, I'm going to make a new prediction when before Labor Day.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.300]   So that would be the next three weeks, next three weeks.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:25.460]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:29.260]   I pre ordered my copy, my family, my family copy.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.260]   I'm ready.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.260]   I'm ready.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.260]   I'm ready for leopard.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.360]   Anything you have to do for snow leopard, anything you have to prepare for?
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.940]   You want to buff up the glossy screen?
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.500]   I don't think there's anything to prepare for.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:44.140]   I think that I just know that we're going to be doing crazy heavy coverage of snow leopard
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.140]   when it comes out.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:50.340]   So the first, I know in Mac break video, we're going to have stuff, we're going to probably
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.420]   have something out almost every day for September, or for whenever it comes out, September,
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.340]   October, you know, whatever, whenever it actually is released, we're really excited about snow
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.340]   leopard.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:05.200]   I think it's actually one of the bigger, the underlying technologies that Apple is rumored
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:13.480]   to be working on are more useful to us than any single update that we've seen in maybe
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480]   five years.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   I can't wait.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480]   I can't wait.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   I love it.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   I love new shiny things.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   Yeah, I'm very excited about it.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   I get excited with a new phone book is here a little alone.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   And it's only 29 bucks.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.480]   29 bucks.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   Yeah, love that.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.760]   You got to like Apple for doing that for leopard owners.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.280]   Yeah, but who who doesn't have leopard?
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.760]   And if you do, what's wrong with you?
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   It's still your gear.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   It's competing against Windows 7.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.760]   They're not marketing windows.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.640]   Microsoft is marketing windows to like Mac Macintosh users who are going to switch their
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.840]   marketing for people who have Windows XP and Windows 95 and Windows 2000 and Windows
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.600]   3 who still haven't upgraded because they haven't been impressed with anything they've
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.600]   seen recently.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:57.280]   And when you consider that I would like to believe that the Apple that I know and love
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.720]   that some point said, you know that they're going to charge 200 bucks for Windows 7.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.800]   We're agreed that we don't make a whole lot of money on operating systems.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.080]   That's really let's choose one finger to stick up for Microsoft.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080]   Apple, right?
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.080]   All right.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.120]   All that finger that we choose $29.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.560]   You know, I would love to see Apple do $29.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.880]   Make this the pattern that every upgrade now is $29 from the last upgrade.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.720]   So you pay the full rate if you're if you're late.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.720]   Oh, would that be nice?
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.720]   Well, that would keep everybody everybody up.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:28.320]   And once again, it would develop everybody in line.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.360]   Everybody get in line.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.440]   Do you really know anybody who's still running 10.4?
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.960]   Apple's very, very successful getting people to getting people to upgrade at some point.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.360]   Well, when you see someone running 10.4, you are like, what is wrong with you?
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   What is 10.4?
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   Is that Panther?
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.360]   I don't remember.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.040]   I think it was something it was some tiger.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.040]   No, tiger was 10.2.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.040]   That was not a very good.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040]   Not a good time to be in.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.760]   No, tiger is the most.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.760]   10.2.9.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.760]   I hated that.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.760]   That was a horrible.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.760]   10.9 was a horrible word.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.760]   What's your favorite big cat?
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.760]   All right.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.760]   We're going to take a break.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.760]   Come back.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.640]   And when we do, we will get your picks of the week gentlemen.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.480]   So start put your thinking caps on.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.400]   Come up with something exciting and wonderful.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.840]   I know this is the part of the show where the guys actually start to decide what they're
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840]   going to.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.840]   What template for was tiger?
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.920]   I just totally just thought of that right now.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.720]   The last one was tiger.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.720]   Let's go.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.720]   Let's move on.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.720]   Next slide.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:30.720]   We're leopard was tiger.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.280]   10.3 was panther.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.520]   No, Jaguar.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520]   No panther.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.520]   10.2 was Jaguar.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.520]   10.2 was Jaguar.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.520]   Jaguar.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.520]   Jaguar.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.520]   Jaguar.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.520]   Jaguar.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.520]   Jaguar.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:48.560]   No, that was our testified at which which of these people are just ordinary aficionados.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.480]   So which one of these people pretend pretentious cigar smoking?
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.280]   We actually don't use Mac.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.120]   I love I love upgrading to Jaguar Jaguar.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.120]   Jaguar.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.120]   Don't give up.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.920]   Performance and elegance and style are right in my life.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.080]   Egg why upgraded Jaguar next week.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.520]   It's got a couple of features to it.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.680]   Just a wicked visit.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:15.520]   But but Steve pronounced a Jaguar which nobody pronounces it Jaguar.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.600]   No, it's a model that you can't afford.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.200]   You can't afford it.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.200]   Jaguar.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:29.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, this show brought to you as always by the good folks at audible.com.
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.120]   They do those great audio books.

[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.920]   Wonderful selection of every kind of book you could read.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.320]   In fact, they've got a summer reading list up there right now, which is great.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:46.280]   See now see they've they've weighed in on this reading versus listening debate at the
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.000]   top of the page at audible.com.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.720]   They've got audible summer reading list and then they crossed out reading and put listening.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.040]   So I think that they have weighed in.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.280]   So we'll call it listening.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.640]   All I say is that nonfiction is for.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.280]   Uh, is for listening to and fiction is for movies.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.920]   I listen to the option.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.160]   I love reading books hurts my pussler.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.560]   Reading is for magazines.

[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.640]   Andy, what are you listening to these days?
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.960]   I am listening to the battle for America.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.960]   I don't know.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.960]   Let's do the boys.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.480]   The battle for America 2008, the story of an extraordinary election.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.960]   Oh, who wrote that?
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:42.960]   This was written by Haynes Johnson and the guy named Dan.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:46.840]   I'm going to spell it because if I pronounce this, there will be chuckling.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.040]   I want people to swing Dan B. A. L. Z.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.800]   Oh poor Dan.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.160]   He had to go through high school with that name.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.920]   I bet that by the time he got into junior, I was a very good fighter.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.600]   You don't want to try to steal his lunch money.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.240]   He'll drop you before he starts.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.280]   I bet he was either that or he was a comic.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.840]   Was one of the other.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:14.240]   Why do I know Haynes Johnson is he or he's I know that name.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.800]   They're historians reporters with a pretty good pedigree.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.320]   I bought this or rather, excuse me, I simply selected it as part of my Audible Gold Plan
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:27.840]   description based almost exclusively on a couple of excerpts that I posted on the Washington
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.840]   Post.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:36.480]   What it is is it's sort of like the post game debriefing from the 2008 presidential election.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.680]   It's where they got a lot of primary sources, a lot of people who are running the Clinton
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.160]   campaign, the Obama campaign.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:49.040]   Oh, he's on the news hour.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040]   That's where I've seen him.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.080]   He's on the McNeil Lair news hour.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.080]   I apologize.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.280]   He's just a whole post-surprised winning journalist.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.280]   Right.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.280]   Right.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.600]   And so there's so many questions that you have about how is a campaign of this scale
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.600]   run?
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.320]   You can sort of think that you that a local campaign like even a mayoral campaign, you
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.240]   can sort of understand how politics works, how compromises are made and how decisions
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.240]   are reached.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.400]   You have no idea how these things are reached on a national scale.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:20.840]   You know, a lot of people, even supporters of McCain, as soon as the Palin decision was
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.240]   announced, we're like, huh, are you sure?
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.240]   Really?
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.560]   And that was one of the excerpts that they put up on the Washington Post that basically
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.440]   goes, I believe it's an entire chapter that somebody talks about.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:37.360]   Here's how the decision to choose Sarah Palin as a presidential running came to be.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.600]   And it makes it sound like a desperation ploy, not like it was stupid.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.400]   But here are the practical realities of running a campaign.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.000]   Here's where the campaign was at a certain date.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.240]   They make the case that it was down to five or six candidates.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:55.440]   They didn't know what kind of a vice presidential running made they needed to win the election.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.160]   And of the five who remained, they thought that Palin would deliver the sort of votes
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.880]   they need in order to win.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.160]   But a lot of it comes out to simply McCain simply saying, you know what?
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.960]   You got a gamble big, big win big.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:11.000]   And they come up with all kinds of advice, who are saying that there are people who are
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.360]   arguing for her, there are people who are arguing against her.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.160]   What everybody agreed upon was that a very, very simple and conventional vice presidential
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.960]   candidate would not get the job done.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.680]   It would at worst just not gain any voters.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.480]   And at that point, the election was so close that they needed something that would give
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.960]   them a tactical advantage.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.880]   And apparently, again, according to a lot of the sources, they were just that the
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.160]   authors had spoken to, McCain was the sort of person who was looking at a gamble big to
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.160]   win big.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   Let's not play a safety.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.760]   Let's go for the one that we think had really pay off for us.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:46.920]   So I've read all the stuff that's been excerpt and it's really, really interesting.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:51.440]   The personalities, the map, the statistics goes into making it a fascinating election.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.120]   Yeah, I just read now.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.000]   I'm only into chapter four, chapter five.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.800]   And it's already idle in the driveway.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.880]   I've got to find out how this meeting turns out.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.480]   Oh, I can't wait to read it.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:10.320]   Did you read all the Teddy White's making of a president and all of those classic books
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   about the 1960 Kennedy elect, Nixon election?
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.760]   And I just love reading those, the post-mortem's.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.600]   I heard an interview with him on NPR.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:27.240]   And it is really fascinating about how far Obama came from when he decided that he might
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.840]   have been going to run in 2007 to winning the presidency and all the things that he
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.480]   had to adjust and change for and all the things that he didn't change.
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.800]   And I, and I, it's definitely a book that I want to, I just put it on my, I just bought
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.800]   it.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.440]   I'm just finishing, I'm still finishing the omnivores dilemma, which is just, that's
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   a great Michael Brown.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.840]   Wrapping my little brain inside out.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.080]   The, I have two credits, so I get to choose two books.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.080]   Yes.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.440]   But you get one credit free by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.600]   And I think this is an excellent choice.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.000]   The battle for America by Dan balls.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.640]   Oh damn.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.640]   I'm sorry, Dan.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.000]   We tried to protect you, but that's just his name.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.680]   Actually, it's probably Bals.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.680]   B-A-L-Z.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.680]   Bals.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.480]   He probably prefer it to be called Bals too.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.360]   We're a guy.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.600]   And Haines Johnson.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.400]   And it is our pick of the week.

[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.160]   I'm going to give Paul Minshel another play there.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.160]   All right.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.240]   500% of you go with an 8-3 degree.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:02.560]   It does sound like that, doesn't it?
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.760]   All right, Alex, Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.320]   He's got his iPhone out.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.320]   Yes.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320]   Now I'm going to switch over.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.600]   I've decided I'm going to be picking Mac applications after this.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.360]   This is my last iPhone one.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:18.960]   Well, just for a month or two, because I feel like all I'm doing is really turning into
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.960]   the iPhone pick.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:20.960]   Well, it's hard not to.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.960]   I mean, there's so many great apps.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.720]   So this is one of our listeners actually sent this in.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.400]   And I really like it.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:33.960]   So I, with my new diet, one of the things that I eat a lot, is fruits and vegetables.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.440]   So that's the only thing I buy outside of what I'm eating.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.320]   And my problem is that I buy a lot of bad fruit.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   Bad fruits, bad.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.320]   What do you mean?
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.320]   Like the old?
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.320]   No, I buy it.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.320]   It's not right.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.480]   The pineapple is too sour or it's too whatever.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480]   I hate that when that happens.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480]   So there's an application called Harvest.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:54.320]   And it's $2 or $3 or something like that.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:00.520]   And all it is, it's a bunch of, when you go to bananas, it says how to select them.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520]   It's a simple little application.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.520]   I don't think a banana.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.920]   So a banana, if you want to eat them right away, select bananas.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.680]   The bananas that, oh, it's not you bananas because we all know what bananas are, but
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.680]   avocados.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.720]   Here's a great one because I screw up avocados.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:17.160]   Size and shape and color have little bearing on the quality of the flavor.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.200]   To test for the ripeness, press the skin gently.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.760]   Ripe ones will be slightly soft and yield to pressure.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.360]   Overmushingness or softness means that they are beginning to spoil and avocados will ripen
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   after purchase.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:33.520]   So the thing is, is that, especially when you go to Whole Foods, you know, you end up
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.040]   with this crazy number of things that you haven't seen before.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.280]   And knowing which ones that like how to pick a pomegranate, you know, those are the kind
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.240]   of things that I just don't know.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.480]   And but I want to, I want to try it, but I can't because I'm scared.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.160]   How do you pick a pomegranate?
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.040]   You pick a pomegranate by choose those that are deeply colored.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.560]   They should feel slightly heavy.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.160]   It should be red.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.200]   Skin should give slightly to pressure.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.560]   Weight indicates juiciness.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.560]   Avoid any that are dry looking with wrinkled skin.
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.120]   Cracks in the rind are an indicator of overmaturities.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.840]   This is how I pick women actually.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.840]   Exactly.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.360]   That's a good good breakfast.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.960]   And pomegranates will not ripen much after purchase.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   So so the so anyway, I've been using this at Whole Foods a lot and it makes me happy.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.200]   So anyway, so I thought I'd recommend it.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200]   It's called harvest harvest.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   Is it free?
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.600]   I think it's like a dollar or two less than a ripe pomegranate.
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.920]   Yes, exactly.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.880]   And the not co time for your pick of the week.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.680]   This is an application that I wish I had found a couple of months ago.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.160]   It's called the Forbidden City colon.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:44.360]   But now these for the voice, the Forbidden City beyond space and time.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.920]   Oh, it is a three.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:53.520]   It is a it's essentially a three D first person shooter set in the Forbidden City in Beijing.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.200]   Damn, I wish you had that in China.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.000]   500 years ago.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   Exactly.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.600]   I mean, you'll recognize like the engine.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:03.000]   You'll recognize the the controls from moving around and exploring.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   I'm but I'm serious is like instinctively I was like, Oh, rail gun rail gun.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.600]   No, wait, you're just look and talk to the OK, got it.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.160]   But it is a very, very deep essentially you just had the entire it's not a game.
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.240]   You have the entire for been see in 3D available to you and you're out to you.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:24.200]   You can simply walk around and explore and occasionally you'll see like people who are
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   standing around who are tour guides.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.000]   You can ask you to keep in a for of this part of the city.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.040]   And they will tell you to improve around and tell you what all these different parts are
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.480]   and what's happening here.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.520]   You can occasionally you can just break off and explore.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:39.720]   You can also see other people who are also using the simulation at the same time.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:43.800]   I was noticing I was doing I was using a lot of like my same tourist behavior where I was
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:49.480]   like I saw like someone who I think was logging in from Japan who was watching like looking
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:56.760]   at the one of the big throne rooms and naturally I was like, Oh, I want to walk around her.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.280]   I don't want to block her view of what she's looking at right now.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:06.840]   It's so detailed it's very very granular a lot of these specific objects are also represented
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.840]   as 3D objects.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:11.360]   So if you want to take a look at one of the dragons for gating who are guarding one of
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.920]   the gates, you can click on that and then you now have rotatable 3D object that you can
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.400]   then click on and view.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.240]   You can go into individual rooms.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.080]   You can explore individual gardens.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.000]   There's some occasionally you'll pop in and you'll see though here's the emperor signing
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.680]   some documents presented with reports.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.080]   Here's where who's being prepared.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.800]   Here's where portrait is being painted.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:35.840]   It's not only see I had sort of interesting experience at the Forbidden City in which I
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:39.960]   was walking for about three, four hours and was 95 degrees and there's no place to once
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:43.960]   you get past one of the gates you can't let there's no vendors you can't buy any more
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960]   water.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.200]   So I was basically you know just dying a third and I was like I can either explore the rest
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:52.040]   of the Forbidden City or I can turn around walk back to my hotel and know them and collapse
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.760]   at some point between point and point B. And so I really I don't feel as though I was I
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:01.960]   saw the rest of the Forbidden City but I definitely got a taste for what I missed.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:07.000]   And if I had found this a month to earlier I could have basically used this as ground
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.520]   level reconnaissance on my my poorest mission saying oh I'm deaf well you know what I am
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.880]   tired but you know what I'm going to blow past this point this point and this point I'm
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.560]   going to go directly to garden that's way way at the back there because that looked like
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.040]   was very very pretty.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.640]   It's amazing amount of work this somebody's yeah apparently the budget for this was about
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:30.200]   two million dollars it was the Palace Museum is technically the name of that facility the
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:35.960]   Forbidden City and so it was two million bucks between I I'd be in the Palace Museum.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:41.000]   Again there is I want to reiterate it's not like you you can teleport from one scene to
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.360]   another scene to another scene it is literally you start off the Meridian gate and you just
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.360]   really walk around.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.880]   But this you know it's funny because having just been there I feel like I'm back there
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   it's.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   Exactly.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880]   It was neat.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:58.560]   I found I found it when I was looking for you know you going through your photos but part
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.920]   of the thought of it is saying what was the name of that section I forgot what it is and
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.760]   you Google around for it they can wind up learning a lot more about the places you visited.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.720]   But I was literally doing things like oh I wonder if I bet I can change the view to make
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.680]   like a digital version of this photo and of course you can line it up and I was standing
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.120]   there and I took a picture of a certain gate in a certain display and yep that's exactly
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.360]   what it looked like and that's where I was.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.000]   Here's I went I went actually I went I wound up going to the left portal not the right
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.680]   portal I wonder what I would have seen if I'd gone to the right and send the left and
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.480]   that's what that's what it was like.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.080]   Wouldn't it be fantastic if there were displays like this for so many different tourist attractions
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:41.000]   where again the advantage of having ground level reconnaissance is pretty remarkable
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.680]   not only for planning your trip ahead but also what parts of this facility did you not
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.160]   see because it really is a huge complex.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:54.880]   I don't think you can really see it in any detail in one visit even if you took a camel
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:01.040]   back and had four liters of water strapped at all times but at the same time it really
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.240]   did add to the experience of having spent spent for five hours there and it's free it's
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.840]   one hell of a download it is essentially one CD ROMs worth of data it's about a 500 meg
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:18.040]   byte download but it was it was definitely one of those oh well well I'm glad I downloaded
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:21.880]   this but I really just didn't need that one piece of information I'm glad I only wasted
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:24.640]   I've been using this for two and a half hours.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:25.720]   Totally correct.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:32.120]   I wonder what engine this is using if this is a quake engine or I do not know it's Mac
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:38.280]   Windows it looks like there's even a Linux version of it yeah wow and absolutely free
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:45.240]   free free free if you register you get extra features like being able to take snapshots
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:50.600]   I think you can also put a pin in where you're walking you can go back to there later on
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.760]   those sort of things but it's definitely worth a 20 minute download walk away come back and
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.880]   then spend two hours just walking around.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:02.800]   Yeah I've just downloaded it I'm really excited this looks really.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:10.320]   The only minor noise is that there's at least one area in which again the emperor of China
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.400]   is actually at his desk at working.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.880]   I don't I'm a little disappointed that I was able to actually walk like right up to that
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.800]   desk and just hop right over and with up being tackled to the ground.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.680]   Yeah I think that that something would have happened.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.480]   One of those Unix or something you know.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.960]   Excuse me sir sir this is part of the sir sir.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:29.960]   You can't stay there.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.400]   What are you talking about?
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:39.120]   Virtual Forbidden City it's beyond space and time dot org and it's absolutely free.
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.080]   Good good find.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.080]   I'm going to share with you.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.560]   Thank you Andy I'm going to share with you one of the freebies that I talked about on
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:50.160]   the cruise I did the 60 free Mac applications you know I realize I probably should share
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:55.280]   some of these with the show you know and some of them you know are some of the obvious
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.560]   ones but this one I had never found and it actually came up because Andy you talked so
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:04.680]   much about Scrivener and I use Scrivener and paid for Scrivener and loves Scrivener but
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.760]   there is an open source free program that is kind of like Scrivener and actually Alex
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:17.640]   I'm wondering if you've seen this it's called cell text C E L T X and it is a well it's
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:22.400]   kind of like Scrivener it's designed for media projects.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:26.080]   Here's a sample project I'm showing on the screen for the Wizard of Oz so you've got
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:31.920]   your you've got the novel you've got your storyboard you've got your production schedule
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:37.840]   and a calendar and you've got your screenplay all here with notes you've got a media you
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:43.800]   know here's the lion roar you've got a media well you've got a breakdown by characters
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:50.160]   by location by props this seems like this would be incredibly useful for somebody like
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.600]   you Alex or anybody who's really interesting he was planning a shoot now this is an open
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:59.720]   source program for Windows Mac and Linux much like yours Andy it's kind of Scrivener I mean
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:05.880]   it's got it's got all the you know the little side bars and insets and so forth a way of
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:11.440]   combining your research your storyboard your calendar and your screenplay all into a one
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:18.040]   project it comes with a number of project libraries so that you can you can try it out
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:22.360]   because I you know I'm looking at it but I think this might be useful I know a lot of
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:28.440]   kids are learning how to do film production and why not have a free program that kind of
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:33.320]   teaches them kind of the basics of organization for the production it also has you know screen
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:39.960]   writing built into it you can have characters see maybe script yeah is that a standard
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:44.880]   a V scripts or something that I mean you can do them anywhere I do them in numbers actually
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.760]   because I just need two columns you see two columns because you need what what's going
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.000]   to be on the screen what's going to be oh yeah right text I mean anyway it's just it
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.960]   looks really interesting it's looking amazing yeah I haven't you know I know I wouldn't
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.480]   know how to how to judge it but I know you would so I'm going to download it I thought
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:09.920]   I'd share it with you and this is great yeah free script typeset scratch pad index cards
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:14.960]   title page it's really it looks exactly like it's not as polished as Scribner had you seen
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.960]   it before Andy you familiar with I never heard of it yeah I have to admit that I've been
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:26.360]   disappointed by open source software that's for creative tools that tends to make me
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:30.000]   precious to get when people recommend these things that goes it goes on to a list of things
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.880]   I want to try eventually because I find of more than any other class of software the software
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:41.640]   that I used to write with it has to look yes this is not that it's it's very it's if it's
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:47.000]   very open source ish where oh what the button is the fuck I forgot they'll find the button
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.840]   and it might be in Java I'm not sure but it's got why is the default button for this operation
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.280]   yes destroy everything that works so hard to create why is that like why don't I have
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:03.440]   to like sort of click on oh for God's sake read the button I you know if you script it's
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.520]   really intuitive yeah it looks it looks pretty sophisticated some look quite as pretty as
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.760]   Scribner that's where you it's gonna fall down you know it doesn't have the mackish kind
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:18.440]   of nice Scribner you know like the the cork board and the pushpins and all that but in
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:25.960]   functionality it looks very similar anyway CEL TX and you could find the program at CEL
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:35.760]   TX dot com and I just like it that it's absolutely free even even comics you can do comic books
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:40.880]   with it film theater audio AV comic books I'd be very surprised if it wasn't if it wasn't
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:44.680]   inspired by Scribner because that's the standard package that you get of templates with Scribner
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:48.640]   it sure looks like it sure looks like an open source Scribner it's it's it's it seems like
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:54.400]   a very motley collection of templates for just a random I know random fan today to do I'm
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:59.280]   glad that it has such a such a wide variety but even I went open up Scribner say oh okay
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:06.120]   definitely screenplay but okay comics if this open source one also has BBC radio play I'm
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:12.120]   gonna say okay let's don't be cute you know the other thing is there must be a fairly
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:17.080]   large community around it because they've got translations in you know a huge variety
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:21.960]   of 500,000 yeah with that usually means that it's a it's a party big open source they've
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:27.240]   been doing it since 2002 it might be Scribner is based on South X
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:33.920]   shut up shut up shut up I've ruined your universe
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:42.760]   Andy and I goes with the Chicago Sun times in the celestial waste of bandwidth CWOB.com
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.520]   and he's a good sport even when I've busted his world

[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:08.240]   Mac break video they have a mock break tech Matt when we've got tons of new make break
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:12.120]   Mac break dev is going strong from WWC we recorded a lot of stuff there that's coming
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.320]   out so that's more on the geeky end of things and then we just recorded a ton of new
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.840]   Mac break studios which I'm very excited about a lot going over a lot of the new features
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:25.920]   which are pretty awesome cool so you'll find those all at pixel core TV thank you Alex

[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:43.160]   to announce in the fourth quarter and that could be December 31st it could be September
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:46.800]   1st it could be any of the above but now we're we're we feel pretty good that we found a
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:52.240]   way to make it easy to watch the video you know we I think that the stream is what a
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.400]   lot of people are going to end up watching because it's so easy just go to live.twit.tv
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.960]   you push the button but the problem is you have to be there at 2 p.m. eastern time on
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.560]   Tuesdays to watch Mac break weekly and so and we do do reruns but they're not really
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.640]   scheduled so we're going to make it possible for basically we're in a time shift for you
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:15.880]   in a way that you can watch on your TV or your computer and we'll explain all of that
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:23.520]   no no I'm just saying it's bad enough that I have to turn off the air conditioning up
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.760]   to turn off the fans I'm already glistening you know with with glow here but but at least
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:32.480]   now I still feel I still feel like free enough to okay I'll leave the shirt unbuttoned all
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.080]   not no no you're not gonna have to trust everybody can watch it like on their TV it's
