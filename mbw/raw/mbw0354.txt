[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers all your hat and Mac needs.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   We're all wearing hats today.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   No one knows why starting with Andy and Aco from the Chicago Sun Times, who always wears a hat.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I think it's in honor of you and your oats.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   No, it's... I guess we shouldn't be ungrateful to the Wall Corporation.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I mean, it's nice that you sent us all those home hair clipping kits for consideration for the show, but I mean, they're hard to use.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Let's say it's not a problem.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Let's say it's not a problem.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So, thank you for sending them, but we might not have to be able to write about them.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   By the way, I'm glad to see that you're honoring Dennis the Minnes, by wearing a J Ward hat today.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   J Ward hat?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Oh, no, it's a J Ward hat.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   There you go.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Okay, I'm sorry, I looked at H.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yeah, a J Ward fire department.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   All right, there you go.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Hi, Andy.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You did not go to San Francisco.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I did not go to San Francisco because I was making my travel plans a little bit too late, and there's nothing...
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's like I had to pick up my Google Glass Explorer edition, and there's nothing like spending a huge amount of money on something that you don't know if you're doing it.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I don't know if you're able to use or not to think that, you know what, maybe I shouldn't be spending $800, $900 to a techy note that is definitely going to be...
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   That I already knew was going to be streamed live anyway.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   So, had I started looking about two weeks earlier, I definitely would have been there.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   We're glad you're with us.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's all I imagine.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I didn't...
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It looks like I didn't miss much.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Yeah, well, we'll talk about it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I'm going to ask, do you have FOMA is the question, but we'll talk about it and say, let me introduce everybody else, because they did come to the WWDC.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And the only gas has to, because he's with Big Nerd Ranch, and he is one of the earliest developers for the Mac.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   That's the fact that was the next developer, next step developer.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   That's right.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Who took your skills and moved them to the specified Mac OS X.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   That's right.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I see Big Nerd Ranch 12 years ago now.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Great to have you.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I see you have a great picture from 10 years ago of this guy, Scott Kannaster, and anybody who's been in the Mac scene for more than 10 years remembers Scott's many books about programming on the Mac.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Now he's at Google as a developer evangelist.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Developer relations, yeah.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Okay.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You don't evangelize.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Well, I'm not as smart as I used to be as one of my own.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But you got a nice hat.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Well, I'm having a bad hair day.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Thanks to Scott for making his way up here.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   We're really glad to have you.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And finally from Montreal and regular on the show and imore.com, Renee Richie.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Hi Leo.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Wearing your LA Tax Squad helmet.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I thought it was a new Mac Pro.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Okay, we should start with a new Mac Pro.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You may all remove your hats.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   The joke is going to wear a new hair.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   This one's really heavy.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Don't throw it.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You can keep yours on.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Branding, man.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And it's branding.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Branded.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   You do not receive trademark protection for what you say unless you're wearing that hat.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.560]   I guess since we have some pros here, we should really, and I think you probably, at least
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.680]   some of you are the market for a Mac Pro.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.920]   Maybe not me and Andy.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.960]   Maybe not you Renee, but certainly Scott and Aaron.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.040]   And with the understanding that this was a sneak peek.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.040]   What the hell?
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   So every developer has a fantasy of themselves as sort of an evil genius.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   And this is an evil genius computer, right?
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   It's a Mac Pro.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   It's a black.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   It's a cylinder.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.840]   And you can imagine yourself, you can plug three 4K monitors into it.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.640]   You can just imagine yourself in front of the bank of the enormous monitors.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   I think it's really going to make me feel like an evil genius.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   It's interesting looking.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.240]   One fan, one big fan at the top and then that what they call, what do they call the?
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   Unified thermal core?
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   Yeah, you mean the heat sink going right through the middle?
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   That's the G4 cube.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.920]   Well, this is what I have to say.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.480]   The real question is, is this a great innovative machine, you know, innovate my ass, as Phil
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.200]   Schiller said, or is it another cube?
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.360]   And it reminds me a little bit of the cube.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.360]   What do you think, Scott?
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.360]   Are you excited?
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.840]   The cube was supposed to be mainstream, right?
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.200]   So I think that I bought one the last day of its availability.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   I'm proud to say.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   So the crack.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   Yep.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.600]   I think the thing with the new Mac Pro is people are going to buy it no matter what it looks
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   like.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.000]   The people who are the market for it want it.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.400]   They don't care what it looks like.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.120]   I wonder if this is not going to stimulate a giant market for hackintosh, is to be honest
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.120]   with you.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.120]   Really?
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.200]   Well, I'll tell you one thing that is a concern for me and ours Technica had a good analysis
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   of this.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.360]   The dual GPUs as great as they are are soldered on.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   Yep.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   There is no upgrade.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.960]   It is packaged like a MacBook Air or a UI Mac.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.200]   It is not a Mac Pro of old.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.560]   It is a C2 upgrade, I guess, the RAM, but there is only four sockets.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.040]   So if you really want to go big.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.480]   You are going to go high density.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.800]   You are going to be paying a lot of money.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   Those eight gig or higher RAMs.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.240]   So as for the design, I love that they tried something insane.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.240]   They picked the perfect machine to try it with because it is not a mainstream model.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.120]   It is for the high end.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.640]   And I love that they decided to take a flyer on making it in the US because it is the right
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   model.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.640]   I do like that.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   Isn't it awesome?
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.640]   I think the old Mac Pro was like the Escalade.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.480]   It was the high end but it had lots of room for kids and cars and everything you want in
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   the back.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   And then you want the Lamborghini.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   It is not a truck.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   I mean there is no relaying about it for anything.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   It is a country squire.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480]   That thing was a boat.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.960]   It was an expensive boat.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960]   But I loved it.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.560]   I mean I have four drives in mine.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.720]   And I think there are a lot of people who love the idea.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.040]   You got all those drive bays.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.040]   It is easy to get into.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.040]   But Thunderbolt too.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.440]   So you can go out to drive bays and you can go out to potentially to, you know, retinethunderbolts
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.440]   displays when they ship.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.440]   Right.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.680]   I think the point is that Apple didn't decide to abandon Pro users but they decided to let
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.120]   go of a certain kind of Pro user.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.960]   So they want the kind that really needs super high performance, the kind that would, for
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.200]   God's sakes, need three 4K screens on their desktop at the same time.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.120]   But not the sort of person who is like, I'm sorry but it's taking entirely too long to
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.720]   crack these 15,000 passwords that install eight radion cards.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.480]   It is a bit point.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.840]   It's a Bitcoin mining machine.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   Let's say if I plug in three 4K screens, what am I going to do with the rest of my 4K
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.840]   screens?
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.320]   Well what are you going to do with the rest of your millions of dollars?
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.760]   Let's think, how much the Pro is going to cost by itself and then how many 4K screens
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   you can you afford?
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.640]   I saw John's here at Cusa last night doing a mental breakdown of how much the components
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.800]   we're going to cost, like how much those CPUs would cost, how much those GPUs would cost.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   And it's not going to be cheap.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   Like the MacBook Air was fairly cheap.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   The iMac was fairly cheap.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.400]   Are you looking at a $10,000 machine here?
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.560]   I don't think $10,000, maybe $4,000 to $5,000.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.120]   Unless they get a really good deal on parts.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.920]   I was checking with some builders myself yesterday afternoon and that was their back
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.000]   of the envelope guess too, that they don't think it could be sold for less than 4,000.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.640]   They'd be surprised if they didn't hit a $5,000 to $6,000 target though.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   And then add a monitor.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.320]   That's with that monitor.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.680]   And Pro-level margins are pretty good for Apple.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.680]   Right.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.080]   I'm thinking 6 grand out the gate.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.880]   But I paid 6 grand for my last Mac Pro once I stocked it appropriately.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.560]   But you could change the drives, you could change the graphics cards, that's when you
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   can't.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   And I have changed the graphics card.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.960]   You know I've created the graphics card a month or two ago with a 2950.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.160]   And this was another point ours Technica made.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:42.520]   The Mac OpenGL drivers are so god awful that I saw no speed improvement, none on a much
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.320]   faster card and on Windows, a ton of improvement.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.680]   And I think even Apple even said this and this is going to get a little geeky but they
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.000]   said OpenCL.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.240]   They want you instead of CUDA, they want you to go with OpenCL.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.360]   OpenGL 4.something in OpenGL.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   What is the Pro?
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.960]   You're a programmer so I don't think it's quite as an issue for you.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.600]   It's more for a graphics or video guy.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.280]   But you know why they want to do it is they want to be able to move between different
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.880]   graphics card providers.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.120]   They don't want you to go in CUDA, they want you to use OpenCL.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   CUDA is Nvidia only.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   It's right.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   They want you to stand here.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.920]   They want you to be able to put ATI or whatever cards inside it.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   Right, mostly ATI.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.520]   I don't know where the whatever might be.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.280]   And also Joe's GPU, I don't know.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.720]   This is a lot of strange things in this event but one of them is that Apple did a sneak
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.720]   preview.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.160]   I mean it was a perfect event for a Pro machine.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.480]   We discussed that last week but it's not shipping until later in the year.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.880]   So it was way ahead of, usually Apple comes out and says available today, available in
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.980]   two weeks.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.080]   And some of that might be still chipset related.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.760]   Some of that might just be them not finishing it.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.440]   It's not a Haswell is it?
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.600]   It's an Ivy Bridge I think.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   That's what Anan said.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   You really jumped in and said.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   There was some debate yesterday about what it is.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.600]   There is a Haswell Zion.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.280]   But it wasn't the one that Apple would probably use is still coming.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.440]   It's not available yet.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.640]   And if they use the last ones and people will be upset because it would mean there will
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   be a spec update to the next ones.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   Right.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.160]   But the point is usually that Apple won't announce a product they can't sell immediately because
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160]   they don't want to cannibalize something else but no one's buying Mac Pros right now.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.680]   So like what the heck let's show them.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.880]   Yeah nothing to cannibalize this.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   Exactly right.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.320]   In fact there's a lot of reason to do it now just to stem whatever flow there might
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.800]   be of pros away from Macintosh.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   Exactly.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.280]   So hey we are going to do something for you.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.120]   The opposite situation from what they're usually in where they don't want to cannibalize
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.720]   the product that they have this time they want to stop it.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.360]   It's museum of modern art beautiful.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   I mean I'm not denying that.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.320]   And it's shiny it's not beat beaten at all.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   It is aluminum.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.320]   I thought it might be polycarbonate because it looks like a psilon.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.880]   You know if it has a little red light it looks like something down I'm buying it.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.680]   That sounds like a great mod actually.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.880]   And when you take the housing off it looks like Darth Vader in his meditative chamber
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.040]   before they put the helmet back on.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.120]   I can't believe that that was an accident.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   No.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.160]   It is about the size of the electronic.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.160]   It's only about eight.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.760]   It's one eighth the volume of the previous Mac tiny.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.760]   It's tiny.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.160]   But because it doesn't have any spinning drives in it it only has SSD.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160]   And they had several of them on display on the third floor of my side.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.120]   So they had two that were closed and two that were open.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.160]   It looks exactly like Andy said like someone came in the clamps took the helmet.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.440]   Hold it straight up and you see the back of the skull all on the side.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.880]   It's beautiful looking inside and out though.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.560]   I mean they do the aesthetics.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.880]   I'm not denying it's gorgeous.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.840]   I think what it would be though is overpriced and not very upgradable.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.240]   And with how many USB just four three or four USB.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.040]   Strangely a lot of fire wire.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.200]   And there's fire wire.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.680]   But here's the here's the heartbreaking thing.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:42.160]   It is a beautiful object and it will be beautiful for about 10 minutes until the user is done
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.520]   admiring with admiring it and they put it on the desk and start plugging all these crappy
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.800]   cables into it.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.240]   And then three weeks later when it's been like recycling all the dust in the office throughout
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.000]   the system for three or four weeks.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.280]   It's going to I mean I don't know a lot of high I know a lot of high end computer users.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.480]   I don't know a lot of high end computer users that are fastidious about dusting.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.720]   Well you turn it at lights up Andy when you turn it it lights up.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.640]   Oh my God I got to have it.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.560]   I'm thinking it's really a very rich person's home theater PC is what it really is.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.200]   It should be quiet with that big fan.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.640]   I officially give myself permission to hate anybody who buys this machine as a home theater
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.640]   PC.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   Andy.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   I'm going to get a look at it.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.520]   Especially if you have to buy it because you have three four K projection screen.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.880]   Yeah that's why I'm saying and you can aeroplane to the screens too.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.320]   It's it's spite but still I'm going to own that.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.000]   I'm going to hate you for that.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.520]   I apologize in advance Andy.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.200]   How many people are that big a fan of the Spice Girls movie Renee?
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   Right here sir.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.000]   And 3D baby.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.160]   And 4 4K screens by the way if you go to apple.com/macpro you get a I should do that again a little
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.680]   little can you see my computer little space animation.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.040]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.280]   I want to throw a yeah bring me over the 25th anniversary Mac because I want to kind of
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.040]   compare the two.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.880]   This is Apple's 25th anniversary Mac.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.860]   Wow if you paint this black.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.680]   That's where all the other in dinner.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:20.360]   No innovation my ass.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.040]   This has a lovely a din plug for the speaker.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.040]   Look at that.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.840]   That's like 50,000 pin.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.400]   I've seen in the Apollo program.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.400]   Well you don't have to bring the whole thing over.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400]   It's okay.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.760]   We just wanted to show the CPU but I have the rest of it.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.960]   Yeah that's not quite 4K that might be a half K display.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.680]   If I put on my iPad together it would add up to 4K.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.320]   I'm sorry to be so negative.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.520]   I shouldn't be so negative.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.760]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.440]   But I do I think what I'm wondering is our pros going to flock to this.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   We don't know.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.000]   Can they rack on it?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   No.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.800]   Well that's you know cylinders are not the most efficient.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.520]   Well actually they are the most efficient way for that volume aren't they?
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   They're just hard to pack.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.560]   But they're not most efficient when it comes to putting other things around them.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   Right.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.400]   The most efficient in units of one.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.640]   And you know for cooling they're probably a very efficient.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.120]   I don't know but I would guess that's a very efficient setup.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.960]   And you know it's a beautiful page at apple.com/macpro.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.440]   So watch you click it and nothing something will happen.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.840]   Scroll?
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.360]   I'm on Linux I can't scroll.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.360]   Show title.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.000]   Well while we were watching this video during the keynote I was thinking to myself this
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.080]   is either a promo video for a really awesome desktop PC or really bad Will Smith movie.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.840]   Up to two times faster considering the last one was two and a half years ago two times
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.760]   is kind of actually that's compared to the current Mac Pro two and a half years ago.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.160]   There's a theory that apple needs a hypercar but they have to have something at the top that's
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.160]   sort of their inspirational.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   I don't know I have to I have to give apple a lot of credit and that the people who are
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.520]   buying this they don't really care about cool desktop design they just want the they just
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.480]   want the amps they just want the power.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.840]   So the fact that they really went to town on this probably knowing that given that it's
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.360]   going to be one of a kind machine that they can charge thousands of dollars for that gave
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.400]   them a certain amount of liberty.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.600]   But I'm not when I when I wrote about it this morning it's on the Sun Times side in the
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.680]   Gridge cargo site.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.800]   I did say that what I like the most about this is that this is not an aspirational device.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.240]   This is designed to actually be put to work and not simply admired.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.320]   I mean you could put your cardboard Quaker Road box on the top of it and just not even
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.760]   admire it at all and you'd still be getting every single ounce of everything a dollar
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.960]   of value beginning out of it.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.520]   Do you find it odd they put AC in a two to eleven AC in there when they offer.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.360]   Well actually they have an AC airport.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.720]   Yeah they announced extreme to a D is literally just around the corner and has some significant
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.240]   benefits over AC.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.160]   This is not an upgradeable machine folks.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.600]   They're buying in my opinion you're going to be buying.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   It's the 2013 technology.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:12.040]   I have a history of first ones like the first MacBook Air, the first Retina MacBook Pro,
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   the first Unibody MacBook.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.120]   Alright so this is going to sell kind of like the cube in the 25th anniversary Mac.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.920]   It's a it's a specialty product.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.880]   How about let me ask the audience because there's probably a lot of pros in the audience.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   There's a huge audience here.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.440]   By the way thank you all for being here.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.080]   This is an unusual number of people for Mac break weekly.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.440]   And Benjamin in the back it's great to see you.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.760]   No no he's just wearing a 5x5 shirt.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.000]   So any of how many of you will buy will buy this one guy.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.600]   Yeah anybody else.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.640]   Why would you buy this or just shout it out.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.520]   You do video production.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:54.040]   I would wonder if some people might say you know gosh I could get a PC that is going to
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:02.160]   be upgradable maybe a little bit more you know effective and certainly more affordable.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.880]   You think they're going to consider what they consider that.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   I don't know.
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.600]   You have to hack and touch it if you want to run Final Cut.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.680]   They did say by the way Final Cut will be updated for them.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.160]   Yeah absolutely.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.440]   So one of my concerns is it vents out the top and I know my wife is going to lay a binder
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.760]   or something right on top of it and the whole thing is going to melt down.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.160]   Maybe it'll be a level of Mac Pro there on my desk.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.200]   Good news is the new video though.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.440]   Exactly.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.840]   The binder will slowly ride on it.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.280]   I was going to say that's actually the advanced version of the CPU monitor.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.920]   You just put like a hollow plastic ball on top of it.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.680]   You can tell by how much it's hovering over that vent how much the CPU is over stressed.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.320]   So try to try to like power down before it gets halfway towards the ceiling.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.760]   Sounds like a game opportunity.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.600]   So having okay I wanted to get that out of the way because there's a lot of great stuff
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.560]   and I did in fact immediately go out and buy a MacBook Air and the new airport extreme.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.400]   So we're going to talk about some of the other stuff in iOS 7 and OS 10 probably the
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.960]   big stories.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   Mavericks.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.960]   Yep.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   Nice.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.200]   Nice top gun reference Leo.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.440]   I feel the need for speed.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.680]   What was his sidekick's name?
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.680]   Goose man.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   Goose man.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   The goose.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.240]   You think it'll be OS 10 Goose man next?
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.320]   Ice man or Ice man.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.200]   That brings up a concept like how much I'm not even joking here.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.960]   Do you think that as they're arguing about what the title should be someone is there
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.880]   in the room specifically to say you're the designated spoil sport and he was like okay
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:39.880]   Marv Rick one big wipe out for Apple.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.040]   Will be your wingman anytime.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   You're right.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   I was really surprised by him.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.340]   Is the tagging.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.340]   Let's talk about it.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.800]   I want to take a break because I have some strong opinions about all this stuff having you
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.000]   know watched we did that we live coverage by the way with the final numbers are in about
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.680]   a quarter of a million people tuned into our live coverage.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.800]   So thank you very much and I'm sure that's a small number compared to the people who
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.560]   actually watched the Apple stream.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.720]   Thank you Apple for streaming.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   Absolutely.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   Bravo.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   They streamed last year's WWDC.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.120]   They streamed intermittently.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.880]   It's like it's like yeah maybe they don't do the consumer events but they know the developers
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.320]   want to see this stuff and they couldn't get everybody in and that might be part of the
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.120]   new Apple thing we were talking about where they're going to do this going forward.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.720]   Gosh I would love that.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   I would love that.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   It's all a chance to be there like Andy to be there even if we can't afford to or even
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.000]   have the time to get over.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.120]   And as someone who live blogs it some people don't like it when they stream it because
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.080]   they think it takes numbers away from their live blog but for me it takes off the pressure
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.840]   of me having to you know if I make a mistake that's bad and this way at least I'm providing
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.760]   commentary and color and not a factual replay of what they're doing.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.560]   I think it's important the live blogs then become commentary.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   Yes.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.560]   That's what we do as well.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.560]   Like a sporting event.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.200]   And I think that's really a more appropriate role for us than documentaries with Apple's
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   announcements.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.440]   I mean let Apple document it.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.960]   For a period we destroyed their business.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.960]   I know.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.840]   And I never understood why Apple didn't stream.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.360]   I thought don't you want control of this don't you you're going to let these live bloggers
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.360]   control it.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.560]   I think it was an attention vortex they thought that if they didn't live blog at their view
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.640]   they didn't stream it live people would be so desperate to see it that they would get
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.640]   a lot of attention.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.400]   I think they also want to make sure that the stream doesn't fall down with hundreds of
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.240]   thousands of people watching it because when Apple be something they want it to be right.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.640]   And I think that was a story from within Apple.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.160]   A number of people supposedly Apple streaming engineers said yeah we just weren't confident
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   that we could do it.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.320]   They're doing it their own way of course.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.800]   They should TV live streaming.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   Right.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.240]   No fun on YouTube Safari.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.000]   Safari only party.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Yes.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.320]   You know they should just put it on YouTube live.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.800]   Then they wouldn't have to worry.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.840]   And if they do that why wouldn't you do that.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.840]   Is there a being.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   Why don't you send Tim Cook out wearing Google Glass just do it that way.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   Hang out.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.840]   Let's see from Tim's P.O.B.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.440]   But let your live stream crash your opponent servers not your own.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.440]   All right we're going to take a break come back.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   We will talk.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.640]   There's lots more to say about WWDC.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.640]   Eddie Inako is here.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.240]   It's great to have you Renee Richie our regular Scott can asked her and Aaron Hilligas.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.480]   It's great to have all of you here to talk about WWDC more Mac news coming up in just
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.440]   a little bit but first a word from Gazelle.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:12.320]   Yes, there may be a time when you feel I would like to sell my old iPhone my old iPad
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.280]   my old Macintosh and acquire a new one.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   Go straight to Gazelle.com.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.480]   In fact now is the time to do it.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.840]   Get that 30 day locked in quotes not a commitment to sell it's just a locked in quote.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.160]   Do you have an old Mac book.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.720]   You perhaps maybe a I don't know a 13 inch Mac book air you want to unload.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.000]   This is the place to do it to get maximum value.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.120]   I'm not going to go through all the steps.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.120]   Let's just do a simple one.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120]   Let's do an iPhone 5.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.920]   There's a new iPhone coming.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   AT&T.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.160]   Let's do a 32 gigabyte of AT&T kind of the middle of the road 300.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   Whoa.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.440]   I think that price is going up 310 bucks.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.920]   Now here's the deal get a bunch of stuff.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:57.520]   I know you've got a drawer full of old rims and HTC and LG and Motorola Nokia and Samsung
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   phones tablets from all the tablet manufacturers not just Apple but Amazon Asus Google Microsoft
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.880]   and Samsung many of them anyway.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:12.560]   Pods just find that drawer empty it out go through Gazelle get a lot of cash.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.960]   Oh look they're even buying Mac pros now.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.400]   That's interesting and old Mac minis and iMacs too.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.720]   Get cash right now.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.680]   So what you'll do is they'll they'll ship it anything worth more than a book.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.680]   They'll pay for the shipping.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:29.880]   So once you get everything together they'll send you a box postage paid you ship it back
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.000]   to them and they check it out by the way they wipe data off of it.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.760]   In fact they even check the condition and if you underestimate it you say that's not
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.880]   in great shape and they said no no it's good shape they'll upgrade your offer.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.960]   I've never seen a company do that but I've seen them do it many many times.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:51.120]   Then you can choose from a check PayPal credit or and this is the pro tip at Amazon gift
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.800]   card gives you a little bit more they bump you up a little bit.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:01.640]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle dot com they're buying back stuff they've done it for over half a
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.200]   million people over the last few years.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.720]   In fact they've paid out more than a hundred million dollars.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.160]   Offers are good for 30 days so that gives you time to decide to get your data off of
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.920]   it to buy the new one.

[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.200]   Gazelle dot com we thank them for their support at Macbreak weekly.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.760]   Big winner in my opinion WWDC and maybe you guys were the audience you could tell me Craig
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   Federighi.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.760]   Wow was he good.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   Craig is incredible.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.640]   He's a really smart articulate.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.240]   So he's an old timer he's been there a long time.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.240]   He's been there a long time.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.240]   Steve.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.080]   He took a little break he went and worked for Arriba he was a CTO at Arriba but he's back
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.120]   at Apple and an amazing engineer.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:49.280]   He was loose he was funny he ad-libbed he related clearly related well to developers
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.680]   which was I think important at a developers conference.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.960]   And he also they let him I don't know if they let him or he did take liberties to kind
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.320]   of poke a bit at the previous iterations of like you know this one doesn't need stitch
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:06.920]   leather to stick on the screen and yeah we felt free zone no more no more no more no
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.840]   more wood this got to be good for the environment.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.200]   Yeah that's pretty good no virtual towers were killed in the making of this calendar.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.560]   Was it his line that one of there are a couple of lines that really stood out and this is
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.880]   the this is kind of the thing about an apple keynote if you can get a couple of line one
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.440]   of them stood out is well we're not going to hold OS 10 back because of a shortage of
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:28.160]   big cats is that him who was that was that was that was a great line and the sea lion
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:33.240]   as well as we're going to call it OS 10 sea lion kidding yeah but that was a small joke
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.120]   is a point to point out that what he was saying was that there's another 10 years of
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.000]   Mac and that's something that makes Mac developers nervous is every time we see right the two
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.640]   platforms get a little closer together we see maps show up and unified notifications
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.680]   we think gradually the platforms are merging together and when they say we couldn't think
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:55.160]   of another cat or another 10 cats so we're going to cities Mac developers think okay
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:01.200]   now 10 years and there is and this was not the iOS application that we perhaps were worried
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:06.040]   about with OS 10 this was by the way mavericks mavericks and this is a surf beach that I
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.360]   grew up near near Santa Cruz that is deadly but if pro if you're a pro surfer that there's
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.320]   one of the biggest surf competitions in the world is there every year well the interesting
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.960]   thing to me was that it instead of bringing the the last two year two versions the design
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.040]   language have been coming together they've been using the same leather and stitching
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.360]   and names and this year iOS 7 and big break yeah they couldn't look more different Iowa
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.960]   this is almost like a snow leopard version of the Mac everything has gone back to the
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.120]   you know stately aluminum beautiful trim well iOS is gone a completely different direction
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.120]   although it's interesting they're really using the design in California thing as a marketing
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.760]   point now they brought it up it's in the it's at the end of their new ad yeah it's the
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:50.440]   news that the name mavericks they said is the first name of California place names and
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.960]   apple devices for a long time have said designed in California on the back they call it their
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.800]   signature now yeah they did that's right they said before we put our signature on it yeah
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.080]   it struck me that they must have done some market research I think for a while being
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.320]   from California was not a positive you know around the rest of the country California
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.800]   was broke for a while yeah well but not even that I think we're California you and I are
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.280]   Californians so let me ask the non Californians at the table I think it was often thought
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.840]   yeah California is like granola what ain't fruits and what it fruits is nuts or what
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:24.680]   it flakes is fruits and nuts and it was not but I think it's maybe hip again well I mean
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.560]   I think they could have expense I wouldn't have blamed them for expanding their their
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.080]   their slogan to well no saying that designed in California comma we had nothing to do with
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:40.240]   proposition eight that would be good you know that sense that the future is invented in
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.280]   California I think it's starting to be a little hipper yeah I mean if you look at the overall
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.040]   message with the made in America Mac and design in California it's it's orienting Apple very
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.960]   heavily as an American company as someone who's doing work in a trendy area at the same
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.840]   time it's clear international is very very important to them it is but they got a lot
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.000]   of bad headlines internationally last year it's kind of really centers them in the US right
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.720]   and also they really want to put the focus on we are a company composed of people who
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.280]   have passion for what we do and this is the this is we are artists who are creating work
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.760]   right and when you have and we are an international global conspiracy and we have no idea what
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.680]   components of what we designed to design it what in what part of our company I think that
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.840]   if they ever were to delete design in California that would be that would be a really grotesque
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.960]   step I think I love seeing that you think next year OS 10 Mountain View probably I'm hoping
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:33.160]   for pedal loan my personal business features right is it beaches or is it we don't know
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:40.240]   places we don't know big sir there's some places that resonate well you know that Malibu
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.880]   there's some that there are that have kind of a nice feeling to them I think globally
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:50.000]   probably California is a is a good trade out to you know yeah but also you know good
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.520]   but but also most of most of us have traveled you know internationally and so you know that
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.320]   you like you go into London just just as like when you're over in the United States you
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.960]   see that you know a tire store is called you pick a pick a dilly fair lane to give you tires
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:08.360]   and right and right to give you it's making sound posh and wonderful internationally when
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.560]   you when you evoke California you're saying oh it's hip and it's trendy and it's everything
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.800]   is Hollywood and it's everything that you aspiration what you want to be I mean every
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:22.320]   character I've gone to I've seen exactly I've seen some reference unfortunately Boston doesn't
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.160]   have the same connotation in Beijing as as California does but it's it's it's such a smart
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.800]   it's such a smart part of the branding it's such a I don't think it's a fine example of
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.040]   the things that Apple does pay attention to old and gate OS 10 straight out of Compton
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.920]   yeah that's Valley yeah yeah what the jokes are going to come you know let's let's go
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   with attitude let's go through some of the new features they finally moved iBooks yeah
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.400]   over to the desktop it's been on iOS of course I think that's a good move especially for
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.960]   the textbook bar it sounded like there was people who didn't want it to be on OS 10 for
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.840]   a while and now that you know again just a whole new team at Apple they can they can
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.760]   do these sorts of things good maps also moved over well I have to yeah I have to point out
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.880]   the Kindle is on the desktop you know you really be crazy not to on the desktop any web browser
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.920]   these maps in app yeah yes so it's a desktop app I think that's smart too because after
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.800]   all Google probably owns this space on the desktop and if you share a link with somebody
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.000]   like right currently there was no way to open a noise 10 if someone stands location would
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.680]   have to go to the web and now at least the whole system works together and also most
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.960]   people when they use maps on the desktop it's so that they can use that data on a mobile
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.960]   device so that that idea of popping up a menu of here is all here all your iOS devices
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.760]   send this route send this location to that device that's wonderful that's majestic yeah
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.960]   and something that Chrome does with Android but absolutely pushing between devices let's
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.720]   let's not feed those guys I can be that guy interesting you pull you pull something up
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:51.400]   and you get to turn on bluetooth from a notification bar what have I said that's what you will
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:58.080]   stipulate that a lot of that can be said in fact my takeaway from WWDC in our coverage yesterday
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:05.840]   was there was ketchup there was copying and there was innovation probably an equal measure
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.520]   and I think that that's appropriate that's the way we as users want it to happen if there's
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.760]   a good idea another platform take it I understand why people don't like it because apple is
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:21.240]   not treating people who do that in the other direction very well Samsung but but I think
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.680]   that that's for users that's exactly what we want but also the user community has matured
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:30.040]   as users as well like with notifications that was the first time they tried dragging from
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.840]   the edge of the screen as a type of gesture and they tested that and people started using
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.640]   it and now they're doing dragging from the bottom and the left and the right so we as
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:42.560]   a way of winning those become much more yeah I webOS deserves a huge amount of credit because
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.480]   almost every modern platform now is using things that we've a less try but never managed
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.160]   to bring to market the palm folks really actually had a very I thought so I had an amazing coherent
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.480]   vision for what you can use on a mobile device cards and we'll talk about them when we get
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:59.520]   to iOS 7 so there's maps which by the way will nicely integrate into mail and context
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.880]   and calendar that's a really strong reason to have maps on the desktop absolutely you
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.800]   know I can and they showed this demo add to my calendar and event and then it'll add travel
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.960]   time it's got some smarts it looks around you to find things that you might be interested
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.560]   in and like Andy said it'll push to your phone because you know you want to research at home
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.360]   but you want to take it out with you when you go yeah Facebook events appear right in
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.440]   your calendar not sure I like that but that's a feature Safari but isn't it but isn't it
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:30.040]   really that's also smart enough to know that if you have if your previous opponent is a
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.600]   location and your next opponent's location be it's smart enough to block out that time
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.560]   for you without even asking I'm not gonna I'm gonna advise you before you try to schedule
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.920]   something 20 minutes before this other appointment that you are supposed to be in transit at
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.800]   that time sir and that's something that Google for all of its map sophistication never did
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.440]   with Google Calendar I think that's a great feature there's a camp example of innovation
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.160]   that's that will certainly be copied I'm sorry that's the kind of stuff that we want like
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.640]   that now where it knows where we are knows what we're doing yes and that kind of stuff
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:03.080]   should just expand yeah now is another way of doing it yeah yeah Safari a lot of this
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.680]   under the hood faster JIT things like that but the sidebar with the links from Twitter
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.920]   and Facebook that's kind of fun the social angle now we see social browsers try to do
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:18.520]   this before and I've always had a kind of mixed feelings about it but I'll be interested
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.760]   to see it is you know it's true that these days a lot of the links we follow come from
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.080]   Twitter our friends on Twitter sure I think it's all sorry go ahead Scott it's all in
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.920]   the details the implementation of exactly that right if they if they make it convenient
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.840]   and nicely collected then it will be a win and otherwise it'll be just less of a win it'll
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:40.160]   be paying right the big thing for me was the change to having separate threads in every
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.680]   tab because previously you know chrome did that Apple tried a different way of implementing
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.040]   that and I don't know if that was a half step where they actually thought they had a better
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.280]   way but this sort of says that no no that's the right way to do it for the right way for
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:55.200]   stability because if a tab crashes it doesn't crash the browser and for security because
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.480]   in a you know in a process communication is limited that's right it's each tab is in effect
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.960]   sandboxed and for sanity because it won't reload our tabs all the time we were in the
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.760]   middle of doing something is it something that was easy to do you think in cocoa Aaron
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.720]   or how I mean it wasn't easy it's never easy to take something like that and stretch it
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:18.320]   all apart but they had seen Mozilla do it I think a chrome yeah and so I think that we
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.480]   had examples most of it I don't think I'm sorry and I misspoke it was chroma I just
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.560]   I'm just thinking if they might you firefox I don't think does that there's a big it's
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:33.120]   a big feature chrome I know chrome did it I read it in the chrome comic book was really
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:39.880]   I love that I love that I love that it's okay moving on we're just kind of going to cover
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:45.160]   the highlights here in the new OS 10 these are you know some of the benchmarks and somebody
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.040]   in the chatroom said that where's IE on the benchmarks well you can't run IE on OS 10
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:55.000]   so I realized after I said that out loud that there's no reason to have those iCloud
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.200]   keychain finally if you're one password or last pass you might not like this idea but
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   I've always wondered we have a great keychain I think I think people don't even realize
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.880]   in OS 10 you can generate secure passwords storm in the keychain but it just never communicated
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.920]   with your browser it wasn't human either it was not the same way my mom would go and
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.160]   click on it and open it and like the one password guys are at WDC a lot of the people
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.880]   are there and it's similar to Sherlock well you know there is a level of Sherlocking but
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.360]   there's this theory and the same thing happened with Mark Armand and Insta paper when they
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.680]   did reading lists that it creates an awareness in the market that you know validation yeah
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:29.880]   that and they're also happy that it makes secure I think they put it up on Twitter that
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.720]   it makes secure passwords a mainstream feature and unique passwords per site because people
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   weren't doing they weren't making unique passwords per site and something could easier to do
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.760]   that so it'll cover the you know people who never buy one password anyway and other people
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.160]   will want more functionalities to the upgrade it's also absolutely and then that's a really
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.520]   important point is that Apple is only doing it for Apple devices a great idea though so
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.200]   for those of you who don't know what we're talking about the idea is you've always had
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:00.480]   a keychain on OS 10 that was unlocked when you logged into your OS 10 user partition but
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.480]   now that keychain is accessible to Safari and we'll remember credit card information as
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.320]   well as passwords so you can easily fill it and it's nicely integrated on so far the
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.280]   design drop downs and all of that icons I presume only Safari though other browsers won't
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.080]   get access which is what leaves room open for one password if you use you know windows
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.160]   as well we use Chrome as well also I'm not sure that's true there is a keychain API that
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.320]   programmers can use so far when I would assume that what they primarily done is made it think
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.600]   between all the devices and I would hope that developers will have access to the iCloud keychain
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.400]   I don't know anything yet on iOS 7 - would be really nice yes in fact and did they say
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.960]   that Safari and iOS 7 will support it because that's one limitation of one password and
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.760]   last pass on iOS is they don't have access to the browser so you have to cut and paste
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.480]   there's no plugins and password is painful on mobile to enter because you can't see it
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.240]   the keyboards aren't as good and yeah so it'd be nice if it's integrated into Safari on
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.720]   iOS that's a selling point well that's the whole point of cross-platform isn't it right
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:04.320]   well but that would be the opposite of cross-platform but yeah it'd be nice to have it on I guess
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:10.160]   cross-apple platforms they say cross-platform they say really yeah yeah I think of Apple
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.400]   as a platform frankly yeah they did show things for OS 10 that they didn't show in iOS I don't
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.560]   know exactly which features are going to parallel copy over yet credit credit card easy
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:25.200]   entwie it says all your devices so let's look at that tab in the yeah all your devices is
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:33.160]   iPad iPhone and desktop and it looks like it's the password in Safari on iOS so your passwords
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.560]   are stored only on your Mac and devices you approve where they're updated automatically
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:44.200]   protected with AES 256 in transit as well as on the devices that's good boy I love this
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.400]   multiple at first I thought what do you mean multiple displays you already support multiple
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:53.120]   displays and then they blew my mind it was bad before because you go you go full screen
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.960]   the other avonas would just go gray right now they really support multiple yeah including
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:03.920]   a HDMI and airplay airplay airplay would be a mate I can't wait to have because I've used
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.000]   airplay with my Mac and it's great but then that's all you're doing is watching it's you
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.040]   know it's all mirrors your Mac as soon as I as soon as I saw that I made made plans to
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.080]   buy like a couple of more Apple TVs because that just makes every single really every
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.480]   single good screening your house into a second display and oh boy I can't wait to wait to
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:28.880]   do things in every room my house with every 38 inch and 45 inch 16 inch screen with keynote
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.400]   now you have second screen on your laptop if you're using airplay to put it up on the
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:37.560]   TV I love the idea of watching Game of Thrones on the TV and being able to you know figure
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:44.320]   out who the hell is Mac Pro 4K display no wires no wires you know I'm now I'm watching
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.200]   it on a 1080p and there's a little bit of lag I'm not sure if it's gonna be able to support
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:53.800]   4K very well but over over wireless by the time 4K has more mainstream actually here
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:38:00.120]   it's all the AD and V doesn't anyway so it's yeah full screen apps across multiple displays
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:04.000]   that's great something you couldn't do before you went full screen as you said you got a
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.040]   great background on the other one I think this is all what should have been done frankly
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.680]   in the first place but at least they responded to there's a difference now because they went
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.520]   to the yearly releases so before it would be like 18 months to two years right done all
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.560]   of it but now it's incremental each has its own menu bar that's a that's a big one and
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.680]   a big shift apples never done that on you can bring up the dock on multiple displays
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:31.800]   yeah also if you if you're attached to an external display and you detached because
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:36.000]   it's a power book it's a Mac book and you like to travel sometimes it won't screw up that
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.200]   display and when you come back and re-plug it in it'll actually start working again instead
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.920]   of having those those stupid like super skinny super narrow windows that wind up collated
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.960]   on your main display and your main machine you have to then hung down and navigate and
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.240]   I do that I mean it really is like they put out roach traps all throughout the kitchen
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.520]   where all these really annoying problems with second screens are and they killed the entire
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:03.680]   colony they knocked out the queen yeah and I think you know they've really encouraged
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.120]   second screen because you know that's how I use my Mac book with retinette home as I
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:12.600]   just plug it into the me too the big screen the 27 inch and it's a nice it's a great way
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:19.440]   to do it notifications which were I think a little annoying I'm I'm not sure if they're
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.720]   gonna be less annoying or more powerful they're actionable which would look like they're
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:27.520]   not getting iOS 7 or you can actually respond to SMS or not I message right in that notification
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:33.120]   right so interactive notifications it'll pop up and you'll be able to somebody messages
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.400]   you respond in the notification websites now will be able to use a notification system
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.560]   I know they couldn't before you could you something so far well it's a far ahead it's
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:47.080]   own notification system but it didn't persist into into a website yeah and sinking between
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.360]   devices of notifications so when you've that's off on one it won't appear on the other is
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.480]   amazing it's funny Google just announced that two weeks ago at Google I owe and now Apple
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.440]   has it too so that's that's if you use notifications you need that absolutely yeah I can't I'm
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.720]   getting up and is that an open is that an open API can any app developer put that functionality
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:10.840]   into notifications yeah yeah you can do notifications no no I mean I mean the making make an actionable
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:16.200]   notification from your application oh I can't comment on that we should we should mention
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:22.080]   as if you're a do I'm sorry has anybody read online if you're a developer at WWDC you
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:27.360]   signed some stringent NDAs and and so Aaron I can talk about anything that was in the keynote
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.640]   yeah can only say stuff that's already been made public otherwise you have to keep it under
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.200]   your hat right exactly that's such a damn big hat it's got are you in the same boat are
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:41.720]   you a developer I am and I'm in the same boat okay and are you in the same boat yeah I had
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.040]   to cover the keynote that's only way I could get into the keynote did you really receive
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:50.080]   a national security letter from oh I can't say that I'm Canadian he can say anything he
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:56.760]   wants any are you developer I intentionally allow my developer membership to lapse a couple
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.000]   months before WWDC and then I will buy it again in a couple of weeks after I'm done writing
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.200]   about WWDC yeah I mean it's not like I'm trying to like divulge stuff that's happening
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.120]   at WWDC but I hate this thing where I want to write about this thing that's in the keynote
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.520]   it's been talked about everywhere but and so it's easier if I just simply not be a developer
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.960]   for about a month I do I have a global policy no NDAs and you can watch the videos later
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.880]   now I mean they're getting the videos update and date which is fantastic but you can if
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.160]   you go in Fannie when you use it in two weeks he can go and watch the same state of the
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:30.600]   union and everything that one else gets us you know right that's nice who won by the
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.440]   way the Apple design awards do we know letterpress ah good I love that Lauren Brickter now has
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.080]   book and design awards one for a game one for a social network that's what he's gonna do
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:45.600]   next yeah coda too code is great I love the standard one they deserve that badlands is
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   that a game yes I hope so terrible night for a word processor okay procreate which is
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.880]   an art app and I think there are a couple other games but their names escape me great yeah
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.280]   congratulations this past this yeah I forgot that the last night was the Apple design awards
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:06.120]   as well moving on finder tabs you are all excited Aaron Hill I guess now actually you
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:11.000]   like tags let's talk about tabs and we'll get to a text tag something I've had in Pathfinder
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.960]   since you know I don't feel like 1988 finally migrates to the real finder and I think this
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.640]   is something that probably came from browsers you watch you watch proficient users they've
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.560]   got hundreds of tabs in their browser seems like a logical extension it's like Aaron was
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:32.920]   saying with gestures you people have gotten used to tabs when tabs first appeared they
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:38.880]   were weird and only hardcore users who used it in other browsers knew what to do with
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.280]   it right away and now it's pretty well ingrained so putting it in the finder makes a lot of
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:46.840]   sense but also we're going more and more to full screen applications and so you don't
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:52.360]   expect to see you want it to be able to operate as one window now you have that full screen
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:56.120]   little button in the upper right of finder so you can suddenly and I think spaces makes
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.360]   full screen work pretty well I swipe I find myself yeah going full screen a lot swiping
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:06.040]   blocking apps to specific spaces so that I have a safari space an email space a finder
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.280]   space it makes a lot of sense to swipe and sometimes windows like you want the spatial
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.640]   orientation of being in one app but you still want more real estate and this lets you keep
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:18.300]   that coherent one app space and still just page through will you be able to our tab spring
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:22.640]   loaded will I be able to drag a file to a tab if you hover over the tab switches to it
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.160]   and then you can copy that's what I want yeah moving in five the only negative about
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.920]   that is that it's not like multiple windows great all right and if you hate change you
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.680]   can ignore them completely that's right even better that's my favorite kind of feature
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:39.000]   people complain oh that's complexity oh it makes no no if you don't want to use a feature
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.920]   don't use it and you'll never think it exists and it makes finder elegant at a full screen
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:50.720]   size final yeah yeah and finally well it's existable it's it's no longer drunk you can
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.520]   walk a straight line it can pass it to your DUI test in some states and then Aaron's a
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.360]   favorite feature or I don't know you wanted to talk about tag I think it's a really interesting
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:04.160]   signal that apple is sending us about the fact that a lot of users are not comfortable
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.400]   with directory structures right and that they're used to the iPad where all the documents
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.040]   are laid out for them but if you lay them all out in one place you need to have some
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.840]   way that you can start doing meaningful filtering on them and tags is relatively primitive I
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.480]   mean it'd be neat if it was sort of a more machine learning thing where you didn't have
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:24.960]   to say what tags went with what you Google plus auto tags now which is really cool all
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:30.600]   a tag is really if you at least for me conceptually I think of it as a saved search so you can
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.880]   say all these documents are part of my Mac break weekly roundup and that's a saved search
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.520]   when I hit that tag I'm gonna get all the documents that are tagged like I got my mom
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.320]   and I Mac and she saves everything on the desktop yeah my now she has some way that she
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.920]   can sort of sort through this she's still gonna say everything she is do you think she'll
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.400]   tag things now I'll be interested to see it my initial reaction is hey we've had labels
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:57.920]   for years nobody used those right yeah isn't this here the same thing no no here's exactly
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.360]   why they put it in because tags are now part of the social language now they understand
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.680]   the concept of tags because they tag photos on Facebook they tag things all the time so
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.880]   it was the same idea they could have done 10 years ago but without the built in familiarity
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:16.800]   what I'm hoping is that it really is mostly an organizational tool and a and a spotlight
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:21.200]   tool I love the fact that you can essentially click it automatically collates all the tags
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.320]   in a in a finder sidebar and if you click on that essentially it surfaces every single
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:30.920]   file with that tag in the same window what I would hope will not happen is that this
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:37.920]   is a precursor to them trying to sort of submerge the whole idea of user access to directories
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.120]   at all I want I don't want to see the Mac OS go the direction of iOS where every single
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.360]   app is sandboxed with its own apps and that you're you're basically have to trust another
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:52.080]   application to locate another file for you and hand it off on your behalf I like the
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.960]   idea of having the ability to get my hands on the actual icon the actual path the actual
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.560]   file that I want to manipulate on those times when I really want to do that sort of thing
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:06.920]   and it does it's I mean it is a much more mainstream solution because my mom can't if
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.800]   she does happen to save something in a file directory she will never ever find it again
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.000]   and the fact that it's in the sidebar is sort of like what John Gerber was describing for
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.440]   Vesper that by the sheer fact of them being in the sidebar you kind of limit the amount
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.960]   of tags that you create because it can't well as it starts looking like a big list and
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:25.880]   it was more intimidating well I don't think that'll happen I think people just continue
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.680]   to tag as a tag at will I don't think I don't tag at all I think it's just a nice thing
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.600]   but nobody will ever use it because it's too much extra work now here's an opportunity
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:39.680]   Aaron auto to some app that auto tags yeah so then it would be valuable if we could somehow
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.640]   look into the metadata or look I'm not rather into the data and make metadata that could
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.440]   be the next step though because Apple's doing that a lot of stuff they're starting to automatically
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.200]   they said that you know photos people don't take care of their photos so they're going
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.640]   to start automatically making events and automatically making places for photos and you can see a
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.000]   future where you know these look like these kinds of files we'll just make this tag for
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.200]   you if it's convenient is it conceivable could you do such a thing you have to be able to
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:04.800]   look at the data yeah the thing is that how useful for users would it be is it well you
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.200]   have to be smart I mean the the voters is great because it's gotten that a data on both location
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.360]   and what time you took it and that's how it's doing the grouping right I think it'd be incredibly
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.720]   useful for the for the fine has to be smart though but for people I think a lot of people
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:24.400]   will if they've used the finder for a long time they won't bother tagging and then a lot of and
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.440]   then other people will probably tag too much and get these crazy sidebars that become less useful if
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.040]   you automatically started tagging things I think that would really hit a sweet speed yeah I think
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:39.120]   that's why I think that's why I think the real meat of it isn't really the features that we're
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:44.480]   seeing today but the way that it will just give future software something to operate on I I've
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:50.320]   long said that I don't understand why every single operating system requires me to know where files
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:55.360]   are and to do a constructive search I think that we're going to see next year maybe the year after
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:00.480]   where we can say Siri give me every document that I've created about cameras and filed for the
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.080]   Sun times from the past month and will just simply give me here the five or four things you dealt
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.120]   with I don't know where they are I don't care where they are but they'll find them tags are a
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.280]   precursure to desktop Siri that would be that would make a lot of sense by the way are you
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:16.800]   surprised Siri is not in OS 10 Mavericks yeah a little bit likewise I mean the dictation looks
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:23.120]   like it became localized but which is smart but the the Siri engine itself is not I double tap that
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.680]   to function key a lot me too I think I think part of it is that that's the that's one of the
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.600]   reasons why I think that I'm I this is just a wild guess but I think that something rebels against
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:38.800]   the engineer who says that wait a minute if we're asking the user to double tap a key on the keyboard
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:44.800]   to activate Siri when we just give them something easier to type a new version of spotlight or a
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.960]   better organizational tool Siri is better when your hands are full and you just don't have time to
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.640]   walk all the way over to your Mac to get an answer although theoretically when the Mac is plugged in
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.760]   so you could have persistent listening and you could just say Siri the way you do with an Xbox
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.280]   which is also plugged in that news crumbs doing it so uh or we'll do it soon so if they're not doing
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.840]   so if they're not doing that yet I don't think that's a that's a motivation to get it to get it done
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:10.160]   from the from the keyboard and the big problem apple has it's still that they don't own that
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:14.960]   technology google owns their voice and Microsoft owns tell me and google does not know it's yeah
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:20.160]   yeah that core technology remember apple used to do the persistent listening back in o s eight was it
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:25.600]   there was a uh or maybe it was even o s seven where you can set it to listen to you and you could say
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:32.560]   you could give your computer a name dimly right now it was a it's a it's a it's a simple apple
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.640]   scripting there's a folder inside this inside the directory that if you simply name an apple
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:42.160]   script with something you're likely to say you'll say computer tidy up my desktop and it will simply
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   look for a script file an actionable file within of that the speakable items folder and we'll simply
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.280]   essentially double click and run that so if it's an apple scripting and do all kinds of cool things
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.520]   I used to have like actually I was a big I was a big nut about this for about a year and a half
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:01.600]   and I actually at some point had to hang a microphone over my desk because I was trying to do as many
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:06.320]   things hands free as possible and then I realized I was doing I was doing a lot more work creating
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.760]   these scripts and expanding the system than actually doing the things I was asking it to do
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:14.000]   but that's but that's why I'm a fan of that kind of interaction I don't think that the Mac does
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.080]   enough for the people for the person who's not specifically sitting right there in front of
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:22.640]   the computer to be doing so much for someone who's just in the room and just looking for a result
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:28.800]   or or or or piece of information like so okay Siri take my take the stuff about my next appointment
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.960]   and put it on my iPhone for me and then by the time you walk out your door the address the
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.680]   root information the the presentation the phone numbers are right there and a folder for you we
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.480]   want Jarvis Andy you want him Jarvis we want him now I don't I don't want I don't want Jarvis I want
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:48.080]   Jeeves but this is you got to bring up a point in that technology was extensible by the user
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:53.600]   and Siri developers are dying to have some sort of a plug-in architecture where I can when I write
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   an application I can add that capability to Siri there's and this whole keynote which was supposed
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.720]   to be a developer conference keynote was not pointed at the developers we didn't hear anything
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:09.760]   we really wanted to hear there's three problems with Siri APIs as far as I understand is that one
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:14.480]   Apple's doing a partner play with Siri so they line up best of breed like they're doing Bing and
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.400]   they're doing Yelp so they don't want any different fears with that and if you can have an API then
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:23.200]   you can just have your app tie in there's no value in making a partnership the second one is that
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:28.080]   Siri is still glommed into springboard it's not detaches on module its own app which means that
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.760]   they have a lot of structural work to do and the last one is handling conflicts like if you're
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:35.680]   three to do apps registered and you say Siri add this to my to-do list they have to figure out a
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:39.600]   mechanism for them to fight it out and see who gets the action from that and that sounds like that's
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:48.960]   a you know iOS 8 9 sort of a problem moving along the stuff under the hood kind of higher end stuff
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:55.120]   OS 10 server anybody want to say anything about that the end of the hood stuff actually
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.880]   actually a lot of the most kind of interesting yeah next code server is interesting that's so
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.840]   so you can have multiple users on multiple computers working on the same project is that the idea or
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:11.200]   so we've all been doing test driven development source code management and continuous integration
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:18.160]   of the modern stuff and Apple is now giving us some help in that ah so it's more than an SVN it's
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:23.600]   something else it's kind of ah cool all right i'm sorry I interrupted you what was gonna say that
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.360]   one of the interesting things about the stuff under the under the hood that he's talking about
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:34.080]   like the faster JavaScript and the timer coalescing and the special memory is that it makes the
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:39.680]   hardware look so much better right like when they did oh here's the new macbook uh macbook air and
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:44.080]   the matter-of-life is so much longer you have to stop and think is it really because of the hardware
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:49.040]   or is it timer coalescing which it could have a very significant effect upon battery life app nap
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.120]   which was interesting too but i wonder what app nap is often i open up a safari window and i'm
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.960]   bored waiting for it to load so i put something else over it to do i'm going to come back now and
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.720]   find it loaded like i used to or is it gonna have now hope so and i'll have to wait and we'll actually
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:06.240]   watch it in real time the idea is if that app isn't currently at front most it will go away
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:10.640]   in effect it'll start to zero but as this is what from the apple website as soon as you start to
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:15.680]   use it again the app instantly shifts back to full speed uh so seamless you think it's been running
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.240]   that way all along you combine that with power nap and the timer coalescing both of those are
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:25.520]   haswell features um and windows 8 has done this as well and this really does make a big difference in
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:32.160]   um laptops because instead of being basically on the whole time while it's off uh trying to get
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.640]   mail and stuff it's it's doing it in discrete chunks and the chatter last night is it's a haswell
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:42.720]   feature but imagine one day when an 11 inch macbook air runs arm right needs to do well arm i then
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.480]   you know that's an issue actually because uh that's an issue with android phones for sure i don't
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:51.600]   know about an on iphone but uh on the android phones it's a huge issue uh of things waking up in the
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.040]   background because you then you start getting a macbook air with 24 hours of battery life not
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:00.320]   becomes very interesting yeah uh let's talk about hardware when we come back more uh with our great
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:05.360]   panel and he and not co from the chicago suntimes rene richie from imore.com both regulars on the
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:10.640]   show joining us scott kenaster from google but a name that uh resonates throughout the history
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:15.680]   of mac and tardin what was your first macbook mac oh when you said macbook i was thinking lap top
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:21.440]   no no the first book uh about 1985 yeah i'm gonna write mac programming i brought i bought that book
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:27.120]   all right well thank you consider yourself a competitor with uh with uh erin or do i yeah no
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:32.640]   you're both helping people that's a past life to me yeah and that was being was system seven too right
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:36.880]   it was before system seven wow it was system i don't think we had a number yet we couldn't count
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:45.360]   that though bus system yeah it was bus system no but uh that's a that's a past life but being a mac fan
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.760]   and an iphone fan is still a different life that's why i'm here and even at google there's
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.920]   think there are a lot of people using macs and iPhones yeah well somebody has to use all those
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:58.000]   iphone apps that keep coming in beautiful iphone apps i might add that was the fun part of watching
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.880]   all the google i/o videos that so many other presenters were using macs to give their presenters
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.800]   for the church google last demonstration being driven from a mac yeah isn't that great
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.960]   enter inhale hillegas is also here big nerd ranch.com you're doing a big nerd ranch training everywhere
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.280]   now not just uh it's right we're in the in the georg was it we have a new uh classroom that we do
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.360]   it in georgia it is where scott came to class 10 years ago yeah we're still teaching there but
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:26.320]   we're also teaching in Amsterdam and Monterey california oh Monterey is great yeah that's just down the
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:30.640]   road a piece there's a confidence in their a syllamar we're keeping out of that it's beautiful oh it's
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:37.840]   ten a syllamore yes oh our show today brought to you by our friends at go to meaning we got a
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:42.080]   little giveaway to give to you go to meaning for somebody talk about go to meaning it's
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:47.280]   probably the best known product from a company called citrix they do stuff that makes business
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:54.720]   better uh go to my pc podio share file go to meaning allows you to hold business meetings wherever you
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.200]   are wherever your clients are nowadays with people distributed all over the world the idea that you
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:06.560]   can go to a meeting on your ipad or your iphone you can even present you can present a meeting from
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:13.680]   an ipad use the ipad camera uh to be able to see the people you're meeting with all of this is just
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:19.200]   it feels very uh almost science fictiony uh you start the meetings you can start them on uh on a
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:25.120]   desktop of course mac or pc it's completely cross platform um and in the apple sense and in the real
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:31.920]   world sense cross platform um you can uh you can see each other with hd faces you're on the same page
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.840]   because it's of course it's got that great screen sharing uh it is uh it is a great way to do
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.520]   meetings now i know you know we don't like meetings somebody seems to really like meetings but i
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:47.680]   gotta say uh when a meeting is fast effective uh when you get the job done it is the best way i think
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:52.160]   to be creative to to you know sometimes you just gotta give all the parties together
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:57.120]   and cut through it and that's what go to meeting really enables uh especially with the webcam so
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.040]   you're really it's like you're seeing people i know people keep going meeting on all day because of
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.840]   course they don't charge you for how long you're meeting or how often you're meeting they just
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:08.400]   keep it on all day and collaborate cross country or around the world why don't you try it free for

[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:32.640]   code mac break i uh was a little disappointed let's talk about the hardware announcements
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:39.600]   we talked about the mac pro but uh i was really hoping for more retina max uh mac books um not me
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:44.320]   you didn't think there was there was seem to be a strong rumor that there was going to be a 13
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.040]   inch macbook pro with retina there was so thin that you might as well have an air well the thinness
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:54.320]   was a rumor but there when a lot of the speculation around mac books just revolves around intel's
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.680]   roadmap because apple can't make them until the chips are ready right so how it has well
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:03.760]   threatened first yeah so no has well macbook pro yes they'll they'll probably be announced like soon
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:12.640]   yeah so i actually held off at first because i thought i shouldn't buy it a has well air because
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:17.280]   maybe i want this 13 inch retina for instance the errors are not retinized we knew we kind of
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.600]   suspected that would happen right is without it's currently it's not possible just can't be done
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.520]   it's the same rule you get thinness you get a long battery life or you get retinine you can have two
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:31.680]   of the three and wow talk about long battery life nine hours for the 11 inch 12 hours for the 13
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:36.240]   inch apples usually pretty good right yeah these numbers are probably accurate and no increase in
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:41.280]   price just increase in power basically you have to drop a price drop yeah nine ninety nine for the
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:45.600]   this is not this is no longer premium product this is firmly in the main in the middle of the
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:51.040]   priceless this is wonderful good yeah the nine ninety nine and that's a 128 gig ssd which is
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.600]   an improvement four gigs of ram all of these are four gigs of ram unless you do a build to order
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.720]   all i5s again unless you do it or co- and explain to me he's much better at chips than me that is
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.840]   there's the chips are theoretically slower than the last generation chips in the macbook errors
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:11.520]   but overall it's a better chip set and a much more power efficient chips yeah it's the u l t has
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:18.400]   well yeah which is designed for ultra low power use um and that power napping thing and all of that
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:23.600]   absolutely built in the hardware uh do they specify whether or not the new battery life stats are
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:29.760]   using are running 10.9 or 10.8 i can't get i couldn't find an answer for that in the past that's a good
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.680]   question i believe they ship with 10.9 so they're probably use no they're not ship with no they're
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.560]   they're the ones that ship with the battery life they would have to they would have to say okay we
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.440]   didn't mention but 10.9s this fall it's not it's off in the distance and maybe i'd hate to think that
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.200]   maybe they're waiting on the macbook pros for mavericks you think that's a long time to wait
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.280]   haswell's out they could do it now they could do it now but the one thing about apple that people
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.320]   say they could it's a big company it's an incredibly rich company but they're incredibly resource
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   constrained they have very small teams the way they're set up it's you just you can't do everything
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.680]   at once you've got a stagger it you pick up at an apple store june 12th or one to two business
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:13.120]   day shipping on these um yeah i think so the 999 is pretty capable that's a 1.3 gigahertz dual core i5
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:21.520]   128 gig SSD 4 gigs ram the new hd 5000 graphics which according to anon and others who've tested
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.720]   is a much improved graphics processor comparable to maybe an invidia at this point right and does not
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.040]   move in a lot of pixels like the retinas i should be very good should be fast should be snappy that's
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.640]   why i don't know why people are begging for retinol on a macbook air you'd sort of destroy all the
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.720]   things that make it great remember that during the during the keynote they also really underscored
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.680]   the idea that this is designed to be the mainstream mac if you walk into an apple store not knowing
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.640]   what kind of mac that you want they're the default choice is designed to be the 13 inch macbook they
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.040]   said that almost explicitly with the new language that they're using so if they were to slap a retina
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.280]   not only would it the battery life suddenly stink but also you'd have a more expensive product none
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.840]   of these things are good for that designation as the volt smack hey they have you want to retina
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.920]   you're there i mean you're the 13 inch retina macbook pro well that's that's why i was a little
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.720]   disappointed they didn't announce a new one because i would have liked to have bought that so instead i
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.200]   bought the 13 inch mac now this way apple gets to get you to have both right right i thought they're
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:22.160]   not doing that no you Leo not everybody not everybody only me anyway it's uh it'll come next week i
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:28.720]   also bought the new airport extreme they're supporting a new standard 802.11ac um the difference between
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.760]   this and the next generation ad is its single band it's five gigahertz the new one the next generation
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:41.280]   which is out shortly ad will be both 2.4 and 5 gigahertz which may be better for people who want to go
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.200]   through walls but it does beamforming which fills through chills it's the very philishola was happy
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.880]   to tell you it's the as far as i know correct me if i'm wrong it's the first access point that
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.360]   ac axis point that does beamforming believe so and that is a very cool technology and in effect
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.240]   it's aiming at you yep it's saying okay this guy's using the Wi-Fi we're going to give him all the
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:04.000]   power fire hose that's fabulous yeah we'll see how that works in practice i've played with some early
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.640]   ac devices from belkin um you know for the benefit of course you're going to need to use uh an ac
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:16.960]   Wi-Fi um you know laptop which i guess i'm getting right we tried it on android central with the
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.280]   android phones at ac and it was hard to figure out exactly what benefit i had to still benefit yeah
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.400]   and it's five gigahertz only yeah so that's actually is kind of a severe limitation so
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.480]   while i bought an airport extreme i wouldn't recommend anybody else run to get that
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:36.160]   um if you need it you know you need it yeah do the new airport extremes still support bng also
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:41.840]   i don't that's as i think maybe there may be our dual band because they have to support the older
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:46.800]   standards that's probably that's probably the case i certainly hope so yeah otherwise i'm off
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:52.080]   the air at home so never mind of course they do of course they do and they look different they look
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:57.040]   like uh towers yeah they're weird and they changed the name a little bit they put the name airport in
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:02.800]   front of time capsule so there is a time capsule version and then there's a non-time capsule version
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.720]   you actually have to uh let me see if i can find the nine time capsule they said they wanted a huge
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.040]   surface area for the antennas to go out no by the way we can put a hard drive in there right oh by the way
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.240]   it is it is by the way abgn compatible yeah it is okay that would make of course it is so you do have
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.560]   two point four gigahertz available i just won't the ac won't use and it's nicely extreme i will never
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:26.160]   doubt again never doubt again am i the only one in miss colors for remember when the max came like
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.560]   skittles colors and you could buy an orange computer yeah really you want an orange
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.880]   computer i love it you better hope johnny ives and watch this calls the calls back they'll make one
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.200]   for you but when he when he brought well when he brought out the 20 the 20th anniversary mac
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:46.480]   it even seems freaky now that wow the apple logo has colors in it it's not just a white or a black
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.920]   wow imagine that we all lived through that we lived in a time where there was a color
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.760]   racolo on every single product i can't wait to see this this should come in the next
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:59.600]   we'll come before next mac break uh weekly i can't it's it's hard to tell how tall is it actually
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:05.600]   is it shorter than a mac pro good side by side we'll look at kitchen counter yeah
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:12.080]   um so ac is interesting but again i i think uh it's going to be it's point six inches high
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:18.480]   six point six inches high and three point eight five inches across square yeah it's cool looking
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:24.640]   it's actually a cool looking device is there a new airport express as well or is it they didn't
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:30.800]   update the express so there's no ac express which is kind of a problem yeah i have to say i think
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:36.400]   you want to wait for ad and i think ad will come soon uh i i think it's exactly as you said if you
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:42.800]   know you need it yeah get it but uh and it might be interesting if they put out an ac based at
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:47.280]   air uh apple tv absolutely because that's where you would maybe want this extra speed and the
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:52.000]   beam forming and all that and our forkate you know wireless monitor future yeah can't wait huh
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.040]   well it's also with this you know with this new like mac pro tower if you're spending six
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.600]   thousand nine hundred and ten dollars may as well run up to seven thousand with a new base
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.400]   paper wi-fi built in for that price by the way on the mac pro just want you to know
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:15.520]   it comes with wi-fi btfo yeah and dual ethernet gigabit ethernet so uh looks like the ears are a
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:21.440]   solid uh a solid product um and i i just i hope it's not like 30 days from now that they're gonna
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:26.080]   announce a macbook with uh grow with as well they probably i mean it's not going to be too far in
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:32.240]   the future yeah but but now as i weigh again they if you need it before the end of the year wait i
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:37.600]   mean like if you like it'll be out this year i don't need it at all how's it what does that mean
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:43.760]   30 days sounds awfully quick yeah but i i think there gonna be a lot of people who are going to be
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.720]   making that decision who just just last year they might have not even had much but not really spent
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.400]   much time thinking oh do i want a macbook pro or do i want a macbook air oh come on i don't want that
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:57.680]   toy macbook air now that they've added so much to the air even i'm thinking that you know maybe
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.440]   this the next time i buy a mac which would another macbook which would probably be the next year
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.840]   sometime maybe that is going to be a 13 inch air because i'm thinking of all the reasons why i
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.240]   would need to have a 15 inch model right now and there that that list is kind of going down down down
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:16.800]   down down oh anybody disappointed there's no touch no i sure wanted to be shocked if there was yeah
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.200]   not this not disappointed i would have been pleased to see it i've been i'm writing review of the
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.520]   chromebook pixel finally and liking it so much that now i'm in like two weeks of testing to see
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.680]   okay let's get let's start using it to the extent where i start to find things i really really hate
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:36.080]   about it uh and i find myself i'm using that that touchscreen on a totally non-touch screen touch
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:42.240]   optimized operating system so much more than i ever thought i would still works if it were just
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.560]   as a third alternative input where you have the keyboard you have the trackpad and sometimes it
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:51.280]   makes sense to use a touchscreen too so i'm not not surprised it's not there not disappoint it's not
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.600]   there if it were there i think i would that's something i wind up using a lot i guess if i have
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.640]   any surprise it's that uh mavericks doesn't have more touch support i mean it really is apple saying
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:04.160]   you know what touch is not going to happen on the desktop yeah well they've done as much as they want
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:09.120]   to do yeah yeah they haven't they haven't had a new gestures to the trackpad or to the magic
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.040]   you know i think i think it's like touches is not the thing i mean there's different so there's a
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.880]   touches it breaks down differently so you have a direct manipulation where you touch it and you
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.560]   push something and it moves the screen and then there's like abstract gestures like on blackberry
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:24.720]   you go left and right left up and left and that opens up something and those are harder to teach
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.000]   people because they're not discoverable gestures are weird and there's a limit to how many direct
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.480]   manipulations you can do and how many fingers right but that's why touch screen is so important
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.720]   because you're touching a thing that tells you what it's going to do yeah a button or something uh
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:41.280]   any and i both i think have got the touchscreen bug how about you me too i've used laptop with
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:45.920]   the touchscreen i love it and it really after all was apple that brought us touch with the ios
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:51.680]   uh they're kind of ceding this to uh windows to microsoft until they do something they trained us
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:57.920]   yeah yeah and microsoft is doing it in desktop and uh whether that's successful or not is is
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:03.440]   debatable but uh i think it's the future i mean you know even when i use my believe it or not my
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.280]   my chrome book pixel i touch it all the time touching the screen on a laptop is something i
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.080]   a lot of people think they wouldn't do if they're used to an arrow but you use exactly just start
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:17.440]   doing so what Andy said several times that resonates with me is that kids today just learn
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.960]   touches the defacto method of interaction and that though they're gonna have to grow up using
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.960]   touch and apple address that market i'm hoping at some point well but i but i think that they've
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.880]   they've said not for a year or maybe not with this kind of technique maybe it won't be like
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:35.040]   os 10 with touch it might be something else like what well ios for desktop who knows but it might
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.000]   it might be whatever is next whatever they do next will be but it's years off i think 10 years
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.280]   10 years off when they run out of beaches 10 years it'll be thought of me the size of a bill
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:55.440]   your table a big uh oh it's 10 strip mine yeah uh let us talk about oh ios what do you say ios 7
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:00.560]   that's the other big and really i kind of buried the lead because that's everybody expected this
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:05.440]   is going to be the big story at ww dc and i think it probably is it's the johnny ivo fication
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:12.320]   of uh ios uh scott's gone and so is felt so is leather so is stitching according to
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:19.600]   greek fairy gee it's uh and what do you laugh at it that's that just had to be a really long
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:25.760]   afternoon to be scott forest all so the person who's who had to who had who spent like 20 hour days
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:31.520]   weeks and weeks on and becoming strangers to their families and their friends because it was their
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:37.280]   mandate to make sure that leather and that that dorm is as perfect as possible to hear senior
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.800]   apple executives just dumping on your work time and time and time and getting getting a huge laugh
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:46.320]   every time that's better for it well dude i mean just to be fair though i mean he scott forest all
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:51.040]   brought carbon he he's he brought ios he brought the app store he he brought a lot of things and a
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.520]   lot of people i'm sorry i was i wasn't dumping on scott i'm saying that no no i know what you know
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:00.080]   no you're putting out apple dumping on well in fact it's probably i see the conversation i see
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:06.000]   steve jobs going scott i told you go to the jet take pictures that's what i want yeah i can see that
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.120]   totally i can see that as well and a little shout out to tim cook who got a lot of trouble when the
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:15.680]   maps were not perfect yeah and everyone said this would have never happened on steve watch steve watch
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.640]   this brilliant redesign of ios would not have happened under steve's world brilliant brilliant
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.960]   you love it i think it's really clean i think it caught them up with what was happening both on
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:30.480]   android and windows i think that they'll put the apple polish on it i think it's a really good step
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.800]   forward i think they had to wait a little while till the user community was ready for the sort of
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.600]   gestures and for the chrome to disappear and these sorts of things that we're now comfortable with
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.360]   and i think it was uh it was time the i mean the thing to remember with this is that this is
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.440]   this is not even beta one it's not even ready enough to have an ipad version released at the event
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.040]   um apple change management roughly eight months ago they had to go through a lot of stuff and
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.680]   they've had a race to get this ready and what we see today is as much as they could get ready for
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:04.160]   wwdc but i think it's the single most divisive thing that they've released in a long time because
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.320]   as much as some people will love it some people are going to really hate it it's only similar in
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.120]   terms of spatiality so it'll be confusing and off putting to some people and the design language
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.920]   itself is interesting but uh not everyone is going to like it and it's not yet finished enough to
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.440]   see whether it's going to be consistent or not because right now there's so many little things
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:25.920]   like there's new gestures but will they be they didn't show whether they're consistent across apps
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.040]   yet uh icons like stocks are black and they really kind of stick out there's so much blur going on
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.960]   which is an incredibly expensive computing operation that how does that affect the rest of the
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.600]   operating system it's it's clear that johnny i've and i think they said the event he wanted to make
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:45.440]   it clear simple plain three-dimensional but we haven't seen how that yeah well three-dimensional
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.200]   because they're when you move the screen you see the background layer is a cool thing you see the
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.520]   icon layer then you see the badge layer on top of that the problem with ios before is they had this
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.640]   linen texture and would be underneath sometimes on top sometimes we lost the space and now everything
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.160]   they showed this whole diagram of him stacking it up to show where the layers of interfacing they
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.640]   needed to be rethought and i think they clearly rethought it and significant but i have to agree
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.280]   that translucence is the one that drives that i think was really weak just gratuitous translucence
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.960]   everything said it was to create a sense of context but it's never like when the keyboard
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.000]   popped up i was like oh my goodness where am i now right i had to have a blurred background behind it
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   here's my quote ready yeah go ahead wax paper is the new Corinthian leather
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.120]   you think this is wax but let's take a look for this as a control center which slides up from
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:36.720]   wax paper kind of see through it a little bit yeah it's pretty though the icons aren't necessarily
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.120]   obvious like yeah it's hidden because of the low contrast a lot of people don't seem to know
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.520]   what's between the flashlight and if they they completely Sherlock all the flashlight apps but
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:50.480]   they don't know what's between the flashlight and the the calculator and what is that thing
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:56.480]   uh okay it's not obvious i guess you get used to it yes timer uh you know john groover kind of
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.920]   nailed it the night before he said it's going to be a very big change and some people are really
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:06.080]   not going to like it um and he kind of nailed it so we've got you know put flashlight right there uh
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.240]   front and center like the thing that you hit the most maybe i'm a lefty so maybe that's not true
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.800]   for righties but that's interesting yeah i think they should have a fart button then they could
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:19.200]   really just get all those apps out of that all you're not until then until then you'll just have
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:25.680]   to use your your original original operator man if man you're talking about uh but but it's it's
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.080]   it's frustrating to try to talk about this stuff though because it's sort of like trying to judge
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.600]   an entire language based on reading one poem written in that language because it's it's not
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.600]   going to be about what we're seeing in this demo or even what we can see in the beta if you have
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.640]   access to it it's going to be when you have 100 a thousand instances of apps that are written
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.920]   written using this so it's actually really go ahead it's i'll on saying is i think it's going to
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.040]   take about a month maybe even two months before any really real valid criticism of via with seven
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.920]   can come out because it's going to take at least two or three weeks just to shed the the idea that
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.560]   gee this looks nothing like what i've been using for the past five six seven years
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.680]   and that's a that's a that's a really powerful nojo to uh to to get passed well even worse i think
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:15.920]   initially it's going to be very disorienting because none of the apps will be ios seven so we
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.000]   have a bunch of developers and designers who are panicking right now right there they are trying
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.640]   to make their apps look consistent with ios seven have in time for the fall
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.200]   including the icons including the icons which are all like they're straight out children's books right
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.240]   although summer with like i don't mention any names but some people like oh you know screw
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:35.920]   that i'm my apps are staying the same i'm gonna be looking different than ios seven so they're
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.000]   gonna go both sides well the interesting part is also that some of the really brilliantly designed
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.160]   apps were already there when you look at letterpress it actually looks like an ios seven app absolutely
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.360]   vesper looks the same on ios seven as it does in ios six yeah and also i wouldn't want some of
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:55.920]   these multi-platform apps one i wouldn't want ever know to look radically different on ios
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:02.880]   than it does on my ipad and does on my android devices or on the web so scott canaster uh makes
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:09.440]   it interesting comparison uh he's he's sitting right next to me so uh between uh the the room leo
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:15.520]   the new control panel and the old control panel very similar very similar almost identical right
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.680]   we're missing the matte floppy icon uh but other than that i think it's a rabbit and there's no rabbit
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.560]   and for faster slower look at that that that is a memory no if they really if they really had a
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:30.800]   sense of humor they would give us a fat bits interface just for like two minutes just to see how long
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.800]   it would take for me to realize they're just putting us on maybe they are and do you just have to find
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:41.120]   it yeah i just i just i just remember when they announced that the that the that the new version of
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.920]   vaccos is going to be what harbor seal and you could just see there were he got about eight hundred
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.920]   people in the audience who thought that's the most brilliant and wonderful thing oh wait you're
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:55.920]   making fun of me now here's the uh let's look at the control center again uh uh by the way the
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.440]   lot of this looks this top bar is very androidish i mean all all the android fun set iconography is
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.040]   very interesting this time because it's it's very different language than apples ever used it's
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:10.640]   very sparse airplane mode just an airplane in a circle there's wi-fi that's bluetooth what is that
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.280]   little moon the christmas that's good that's a nice feature by the way that apples implemented
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:18.400]   quite well and it should be front and center you scroll up Leo you've got dots instead of carrier
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.360]   signals now yeah what is that is that i thought maybe that was just in lieu of an atn t but you
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.160]   think that's gonna be part of this carrier signal that's the carrier signal but wait a minute uh
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:34.320]   okay one two three four five bars that's the bars bars aren't bars i get one dot one dot of reception
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.680]   here um if you go they're one of the other pictures there Leo they show the um the new card view so
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.920]   multitasking has been updated not yeah this is great level but the interface and this is straight
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.640]   out of webOS and now almost everyone is using this card you know yeah you have you have home screen
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.960]   in there which you can't fling away but everything else you can fling away yeah from the developer
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.920]   point of view the multitasking is really neat in that when you receive a push notification your app
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.320]   gets some time on the cpu so if there's you know usually there's an update and the first thing you're
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.560]   going to do when the person presses it is go and fetch the extra information for that update and
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.760]   now you can do that before they actually go and try and read the notification so it will make the
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.680]   application seem much snappier and this is important uh to this goes along with the uh with the power
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.200]   napping because the real risk on uh global multitasking for apps is that you're you're gonna have an
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.080]   operating system that never sleeps that everybody's busy everybody's wants cpu time and ram back
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:33.440]   the o and battery and if the if the os can really handle it intelligently and so that's built in
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.120]   well that's what they that's what they're saying is that they put enough smarts in where they can
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:43.200]   dedicate cpu time to the apps as is appropriate and clump it and clump it together the ones that
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:46.720]   you use the most they'll update the most but they'll also wait until you have good reception good
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:50.720]   areas before it does a lot of those things so it won't be i spent a huge amount of time on android
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:56.320]   phones making you know apps that are normally going to wake it up say shut up i don't want you
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.760]   to do anything until you and that's the only way to improve battery life on an android phone it
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.800]   makes a huge i mean like a two x difference but it's a lot of work so if the os does that properly
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:08.720]   you're gonna see great that much improved battery there's so many cool ideas there
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:14.000]   especially the one that uh i i i don't have the full background on it but the the basic gist of
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.640]   it is that if one app decides that it needs the gps right now to get a location the os as well
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.560]   here we have two other running apps that would like to know what where where they are right now
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:26.400]   since we've powered up the radio anyway let's give them each about a half a second to get their
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.400]   work done well before he shut down the radio again so this seems to be a lot of really interesting
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:34.720]   ideas under the hood yeah yeah well and battery life is probably the single most important thing
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:39.920]   on a mobile device so anything that they can do and the app was in a good position because
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.640]   they really control the platform in a way that android does not so they can really enforce good
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:49.920]   rules absolutely the whole stack and the hardware yes there's notification center i'm not as happy
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:56.560]   about uh still pulls down from the top unfortunately it's uh still got that tiny touch target the little
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:03.840]   x not actionable still uh yeah no actionable um you have to tap the message to open messages and
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.840]   carousel then try to find your way back because there's no carousel back you go to hunt for the app
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:14.080]   yeah i mean i do like the lock screen notification that's nice but uh you know this is a big annoyance
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:18.240]   for me notifications i have to close each thing one by one all the way through there's no global
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.920]   clear and they really need that's a simple thing it also depends how much of your information you
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:25.600]   want to let leak through the lock screen well that's another question is that chadram's asking
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:30.880]   us because right now when you see the lock screen what you see is a message yeah can you turn that off
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:37.120]   i believe so i hope so is the what's the granularity do we know of like can you i don't i don't imagine
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:42.400]   you can turn it off per app or just like you know you can do certain things on the lock screen now
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:48.000]   you can use siri through the lock screen right or you can disable yeah entirely and everything right
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.560]   and i imagine they'll do it like that i would i would guess but i don't know uh i tunes radio
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.840]   which we thought was going to be a really big announcement from apple was just kind of a
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:01.440]   oh by the way yeah but i think it might be significant and they certainly sure large bandora pretty damn
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.440]   good yeah so you put that's only and only and you get it for free only for your night tunes match
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:11.440]   subscriber 20 hours a year and uh and supporting i guess is probably not audio ads but i ads i
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.720]   would i they weren't clear in the public stuff yet go ahead and dandy i'm sorry oh no i i i was
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.080]   saying is that that was probably the biggest disappointment of the entire keynote for me
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:25.520]   because i was hoping that they would it would include the the trademark apple phrase we decided
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:30.000]   that we wouldn't want to do we we've been we've been wanting to do with people asking us to do
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.400]   subscription radio for years we don't want to do the same product as somebody else we want to do a
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:40.160]   better product than anybody else and now we're proud to unveil it was no no it's it's if if there
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:45.600]   was a reason for this service to exist apart from we're upset that people are giving money to pandora
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:50.800]   instead of us they really didn't communicate that during the keynote yeah i'm kind of with you on that
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:56.000]   that's a bummer yeah uh and yeah i can't wait to use it and because i'm an i-tunes match user
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.640]   it's free uh it's only an i-tunes iTunes iTunes on the desktop i in windows too by the way itunes
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:09.680]   uh as well as ios uh it looks pretty good it's got the curated playlist that the zoom uh the zoom
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.880]   pass uh invented um keeps a track of stuff you can go back and buy a diatune store later
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.360]   that's i'm sure why the record labels liked it there's that big 129 button right next to it which
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.440]   is part of the value apple brings to the proposal with a record company right of course yeah but still
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:28.960]   i mean that i was watching the tony awards on sunday and within by the end of the night i had about
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.840]   eight cast albums added to my google play library just with just from the first the fact you can
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.240]   simply say kinky boots great give me the entire album great i've already paid for that okay now
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:42.480]   give me metilda great got that whole album and i'm listening to the you know to nothing but these
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:47.440]   songs non-stop i'm not sure it'd be the same sort of pleasurable i'm not sure why you're laughing but
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.640]   i'm sure it's not for a reason that you should be scolded about you like the show tunes do you
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:59.040]   i'm with you here is it Broadway Broadway is back on the rich american international tapestry of
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.640]   culture and if you were to shun mock or denigrate someone who oh yeah you know what you know cold
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:11.520]   porter oh my god what a what a horrible person he was he didn't use yes you are oh oh oh Leo i'm sure
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:16.240]   everybody there everybody in the audience knows you're teasing me i love show tunes too and
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:21.520]   Neil Patrick Harris and that opening number is we're perhaps the best opening number of any award
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.840]   show i've ever seen agree that was that was that was talk about talk about okay what will the
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:32.080]   bro no i'll end the rattle rattle really soon but if you have not seen this opening number watch this
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:36.960]   and you're thinking how many things could have gone wrong in this incredibly major thing where
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:41.440]   if any one of these like 800 things going on in sequence had screwed up it would have brought
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:45.920]   the entire thing to a screeching call they would have to go to commercials very brave every single
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:51.760]   thing step step step step step it's on you it's it's on youtube i was like i watched it like for
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:57.680]   the first two minutes i missed i missed the opening and then okay guess what mac tubes launch download
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:04.960]   sync's ipad yeah really and kudos to Neil Patrick Harris who showed himself to be really one of the
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:10.720]   greatest entertainers alive dr horrible himself dr horrible you are no longer nerd base you are
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:16.080]   the king i mean just was a just a beautiful and you're right andy i mean that but i think what they
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:21.200]   were saying is look we do it live eight nights a week uh you know i mean actually literally literally
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:26.480]   said that and i think that that's it well also the bit where like say keep give me my my late miser
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:31.600]   out film like to spice up yeah on the stage we don't need a close up to prove we're really singing
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:38.160]   must watch must watch but they came back but getting it back to the point i mean what i love
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.240]   about spotifying other services like that is that the you can hear about an album and then
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.720]   have that album yeah and then i'm the sort of person who will then when if i've listened that
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.640]   album a few times i like it i will convert that to a purchase i'm just not sure that i radio
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.880]   gives me something that i really really want it's probably similar to the one password sure locking
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.480]   thing where for a lot of people they'll just use this because built-in is the default and it's okay
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.720]   with them and people like andy or myself or or you will just get the better service there's
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:08.480]   something to be said though in this well i mean it's it's it's just that it's a very straightforward
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:12.480]   streaming radio service and and to and to Renee's point that's an excellent point i mean what we
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.960]   we're we're experienced users and we tend to think though why don't people use this service that's
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.680]   so much more full-featured and cost just as much money the answer is that this service comes free
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:25.040]   built into the thing they don't have to download anything they don't have to hear about spotify
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.880]   they don't hear about google play music or anything like that they just know that there's this thing
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.640]   where if they say hi i want to hear some syndi Lauper then suddenly you're hearing i also will not
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.600]   tolerate any chuckling about miss syndi Lauper no i am with you on syndi Lauper now Tony
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.560]   winning she is close when she's got three quarters away to any of you she's got exactly all she just
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:50.000]   wants to have fun and yeah i'm with you on that if she if her work with jeff gobleman vibes have been
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.680]   appropriately acknowledged by the county
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.480]   her work with hulk Hogan too was underrated i think the asker may may elude syndi Lauper i'm sorry to
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.480]   say boys never know wouldn't you have thought the Tony would be the last one for yeah yeah true well
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.000]   you know she's a composer hell or no hell or performer hell would consider being a composer
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:16.320]   uh moving along to mackintosh and apple stuff um photos they apple Sherlock themselves they Sherlock
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:22.160]   dive photo their new uh photo album really nice i i think we all right i mean you can you can't
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.520]   first of all they've added events they've added uh you know sorting by geography sorting by time
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:32.640]   again something android's done but and more of their automated will curated for you sort of
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.760]   thing because we know you're not like the time machine stuff we know it's okay we know you're not
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.120]   gonna back up you know we're not gonna sort your albums we'll do all that for you if you want us
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.360]   to one thing that they did innovate on and beautifully is the thumbnails even the little teeny
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:47.440]   meany tiny thumbnails that you can scroll through and stuff that's nice yeah no but i've never seen
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.160]   anybody do that that's really really well done i like how they've done it almost as well as the
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.880]   samsung galaxy s4 does that thing where you hover over it and just magnify it that's a great idea
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:03.600]   any you start selling me do i we make you bitter with a syndi Lauper i just i know you go after syndi
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:12.000]   they uh have a voice like that leave syndi alone since since the 20s let me find out
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:17.040]   still one meeting that apple stole that i really love which is microsoft has this idea of semantic
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:22.240]   zoom where when you do the pinch gesture it doesn't just make it smaller it actually reformats the
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.640]   data so that it's still usable in that smaller format is that on safari that it does that or
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.480]   where that's in the photos app that you're talking about yeah it's all about compressing entire
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:35.040]   year's photo into one little strip on the screen you think that's useless but you get to see oh wait
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:39.600]   a minute you see that big string of nothing but blue and beige that was my vacation vote vacation
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.200]   to the cape and so you might have forgotten that that was that summer you went there but now we
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.760]   can drill right into it that's very nice and i didn't mean to imply that i photo is gone by any
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:51.920]   means but a lot of the reason people use i photos for the albums and the organizational tools and
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:57.680]   that's now built into the camera photo app yeah uh airdrop continues the progression to get away
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.200]   from wires which is good you can just drag and drop files over it wasn't clear to be i don't
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:05.600]   know anybody if they said it or not whether airdrop between os 10 and ios also exist because they
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.320]   only showed oh i presume that is is and i don't know if they're using wi-fi direct because it sounded
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:14.880]   like it might be blue to us so yeah they did they did also in the keynote mention that there is an
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.200]   api for airdrop as well so you'll be able to do that's not things out to airdrop from your
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:24.800]   application so no more bumping samsung phones uh they they specifically that's targeted samsung
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.880]   because they kind of dist ai for chrome then they disc google for bang and then they just
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.520]   sam's on for a dance this is a bicycle opportunity but they kind of like they made fun of every one
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.280]   sort of equally and they kind of made you feel happy at the same that's right you know you're
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.880]   right it didn't feel angry or bitter uh it was jolly it was better than i.e but you know but being
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:48.080]   is better than crony yeah and they made fun of themselves yeah with getting really green felled
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:52.960]   and see like no no i i i think that didn't feel like a bitter angry thing and yet it was a feisty
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:58.880]   st apple we've seen in a long tim kook's apple yeah tim kook's new feisty apple uh the camera app they
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:05.200]   added instagram filters more square camera mode and it's and even a square framing yeah that's nice
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.360]   and now and now the greatest mobile camera in the world now can take the crappie
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.920]   i'm happy about this i'm happy about this for one reason because i'm never again gonna get
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.680]   a press release saying we've added filters to our app i hope not put that in the system and
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:24.160]   stop but i'm not gonna have calendar app now with photo filters uh safari on ios new formatting
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:30.080]   for a full screen that's nice it's pretty new tabs gorgeous tabs thank you uh and at bookmark
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:35.440]   i love that isn't that great that kind of sideways cover flow cover flows back baby and you thought
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:40.640]   you missed roll it x yeah siri newly empowered to actually do things she used to do yeah setting
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:45.360]   and she can be a dude and a dude she's always been a dude in french and much like much much
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:52.400]   much i do are in french wait a minute that sounds wrong dude dude uh but i do never mind i use the
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:30:00.320]   britain never mind the australian board abort abort a wave them off goose goose is it in a
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:07.920]   purchase line i do not think you mean to go there new interphase theory too new interface for siri
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:12.240]   with the squiggly line i think that reflects what you're saying i hope it gets a voice line absolutely
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.320]   yeah it's not just some random squiggly line okay let's play let's play the video on the uh
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:20.560]   the way there it is random squiggly line it's the old voice control line isn't it yeah i think
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:25.760]   it is we've seen this before that was interesting is that they use ultra thin hellvetica everywhere
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:31.840]   except on siri which gets big bold hellvetica that's interesting yeah and uses bing for uh it's
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:36.960]   web search results the series of partner play no it's a partner like so google is still the default
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:41.680]   in safari uh apple makes partnerships for siri and microsoft will get a better deal for the
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:45.440]   imitable that and to me that was one of the most frustrating things about siri that
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:50.160]   uh most of my queries until i learned i do not know what you're talking about you want me to search
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:56.080]   the web hey great idea yeah what you know and now presumably it'll do that without having to ask
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:03.360]   permission first but will bing become a verb to bing it siri bing this good question new mail uh
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.880]   improve much improved mail again stealing some ideas from mailbox and swipe to delete a little bit
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:15.760]   of like pretend hub in there oh yeah oh yeah because it's unified over yeah um i don't know why they
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.840]   started with the weather app every damn weather app in the world has had weather backgrounds because
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:26.560]   it's never hccn windows mobile yeah i mean this is like touch uh okay nice uh i don't even know
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:30.560]   anybody who still uses the built-in weather app i guess this is again this is it these are
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.720]   features for people who don't add uh other third party i use a built-in weather app i stick my head
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:39.920]   out the window then i use a built-in weather app and you get it's snowing it's just snowing i always
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:45.920]   snowing yeah mount reneer london everywhere uh parris is raining that's the difference crying
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:52.240]   i think what's funny about all this is how little of it was directed at developers there was very
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:56.880]   few technologies that were made available to developers that we didn't have already they said
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:02.240]   you know 1500 new api's but that was it that was it yeah and and you get the feeling that this keynote
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:06.000]   gets more and more user focused is there only keynote of the year it's not nd8 so they're not
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.280]   gonna say anything that's and there are things that developers were dying to hear so for example we
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:17.040]   are all dying to have time limited free trials people are afraid to spend more than 99 cents for
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:22.720]   an app so you can't charge more for apps until apple gives us free timed out trials yeah but if it
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:26.800]   weren't for that we'd not we wouldn't have an app purchases in freemium thank you apple
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:32.880]   since it's tapped out is the most expensive application i've ever purchased it's more than
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:36.960]   photoshop at this point and paid upgrades we'd love to have paid upgrades and i think that apple
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:40.080]   actually has to grapple with this because they just announced an update they're going to do an
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:44.160]   update for iWork and people are buying up to the app store and we're gonna have to see how they
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:49.120]   deal with that maybe that's the moment will happen final cup pro update is gonna be another
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:53.920]   200 bucks or free it's their choice yeah yeah time to fix it but the iq we didn't talk about iCloud
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:58.560]   in the cloud so let's talk about services yeah iWork which was interesting to me because it looks
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:02.160]   beautiful it looks gorgeous look like they finally did an html what you could do on the desktop
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.640]   but they didn't announce any collaboration which is the only reason why anyone uses or suffers
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:11.440]   through google docs oh yeah you can't share docs well you like in google docs you can sit there and
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.560]   like three people will write an article at the same time together and iWork it looks like
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.480]   your iWork picture and make it look really pretty but and there there's no collaborative commenting
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.600]   either that kind of surprised me that they had it several years and a big announcement but
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.440]   didn't add collaboration yeah i mean initially on the face of it looked to me that was as a
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:32.800]   response to google docs and i mean the office 365 but i didn't you're right without collaboration
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:36.080]   what is it go ahead and i would i would i wouldn't i wouldn't say that collaboration is the be all
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:41.520]   end all i mean it's nice to basically it's it's it's nice to be able to it makes it easier for
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:47.120]   these for users to lock into iWork if you give them a way to use it without using it on an apple logo
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:52.720]   device and given that now it's it's a it's being projected into androids being projected into
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:58.560]   into windows the thing that i thought was really interesting is that if you have a 250-dollar
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:04.560]   Chromebook now you can use that as your handy-dandy mobile computer for editing all of your iWork
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:10.960]   projects and maybe even presenting your keynote projects instead of spending $1200 for a MacBook
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:16.240]   if you want to if you want to do it that way if anything i wish that they had given us more of a
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:21.200]   plan for what they intend to do for the actual desktop iWork they did hint that there's going to
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:25.600]   be a new version of it out later on this year interesting that they didn't even show a single
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:30.240]   new feature out of it maybe i don't maybe not so interesting given that iWork is an iWork is not a
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:37.280]   service and iCloud is but it kind of makes you think that they really do want iWork to be more of a
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.440]   destination for all of your devices and if they keep bleeding off users to google docs and to and
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:49.200]   to office 360 excuse me and the cloud version office that seems like a simple thing for them to do to
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:54.720]   make this option for iWork in the cloud i think you ended up with the worst of both worlds that is
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:59.520]   you don't have the sharing of google docs and you don't have the local native apps that you can
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:04.400]   use it on the airplane or the ubiquitous it's a beautiful web app i was kind of i was really
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:10.000]   surprised at how much functionality they'd put into just a just simple excuse me not simple html
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.320]   five but essentially anything that's that's running a modern browser can run this and this is the
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:18.800]   this is the functionality to get with it i think that i think it just increases and leverages the
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.720]   the importance of iWork and that's for that reason it's good enough it's also good to see apple
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.640]   you know dipping their fingers back into the html five stuff and they'd had the beta
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:29.840]   iWork that didn't really go anywhere and they had the pastry kit stuff and the proud score stuff and
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.880]   it kind of disappeared and now it's really back and people you'll complain about iTunes on windows 8
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:39.280]   and who knows how apple's going to continue cross with that famous Tim Cook line i could make you
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:44.000]   know android apps if i want to don't want to but i could and now here you have iWork it's going
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.680]   to work everywhere they do say in the features coming soon on the apple page sending a link to
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.000]   a document will will be coming so you could at least share a document that way you couldn't work
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.080]   collaboratively uh and version histories that'll be nice i mean it it's impressive it's uh kind of
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:06.480]   more like an html five demo than anything else but uh iWork's four years old they really need to do
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.120]   something about this and apple's not notoriously great with service it's also let me it's a different
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.240]   approach baby steps iWork is more layout centric than either google or microsoft like word you can
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.480]   stick stuff in but it's really a text flow program thing imported a word document it just looks so
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:28.000]   boring yeah but so important to do right well and they do read it's a it's round tripping for
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.920]   all of the office uh programs so that's important i wouldn't always do that right yeah i wonder if
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:39.280]   announcing it yesterday is a sign that they're going to put more energy behind iWork and add
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:44.080]   things like real-time collaboration or if it's going to be dormant for a while again did
[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.720]   devant let me ask erin did developers uh were they um disappointed with the lack of talk about
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:54.080]   services i mean there really wasn't yes definitely i mean uh iCloud syncing stuff is
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:00.640]   it's woefully and i and woefully bad and iWork and that's it and they didn't solve the iCloud syncing
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:04.960]   they didn't solve the iCloud at all and that was another thing that everybody was waiting for
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.480]   they're probably is a session in private right there's nda stuff that covers all that but they
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:12.160]   didn't want to mention that in public but it would imagine the standing oh they would have gotten
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:18.640]   if they said and now document syncing works right yeah that's it they if they had given iCloud
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.720]   document syncing as much crap as they gave skew muffler points humor for design they would have
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:27.600]   rushed the stage and just carried them out joy saying at last a sign that you understand that was
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:31.200]   the that was the big complaint here from every you had a ticket to wdc you were probably happier
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:37.840]   with that yesterday yeah uh all right if we covered everything that happened okay last
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:44.800]   thoughts before we wrap up the wwdc wrap up anything else oh ios in the car yeah siri will appear in a
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.960]   lot of vehicles including ediq's Ferrari yeah he drives a Ferrari well he's on a board he's on the
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.000]   board that's why he said yesterday you know one of these cars interested me a lot more than the
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.120]   other oh i got it now wow i think developers waiting to see if we have the ability to write
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.800]   applications that work on the car screen if it's going to be treated just as another screener if
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:08.080]   that's going to be sort of locked down to siri and right i tunes only well and also and also if this
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:11.200]   is if this is only going to be a feature on the ultra is this if this can be a luxury
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:15.040]   differentiator in the car line or if this is going to be something you can only get on the on in the
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:20.000]   car if you spend an extra 800 dollars with sex or package it's it's poo who cares it's stupid
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.320]   it's it's not it's nice for people who have that kind of money but i would much rather see some
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.440]   so when when i first saw that icon of the you know they got the usual gang apps gang i by cons to
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.800]   show as they're walking through here the stuff that we're going to show you during this keynote
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.640]   and i see ooh i see a steering wheel with a phone in it is there going to be a car app in it
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:42.880]   because uh android has a whole category of car apps that make just any phone or any tablet just
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.840]   functions so brilliantly in any car you want to put it in so just like when the previous keynotes
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:52.800]   when they talked about oh and we have integration with bmw cars where you can control the the the
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.120]   audio transport right from the steering wheel i'm saying great i'm going to rush right out and buy
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:04.000]   that's 72 000 car just so that i don't have to reach up and do this once right so john if you
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.440]   would show my screen so there's the uh there's the apps and by the way they bring thin helvetica to
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:15.200]   cars which i think is important uh and make it make it hard to read really good really good
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:20.000]   move on a car i think this is bigger a bigger story for the car manufacturers and it is for apple
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.120]   or apple users this is this is car manufacturers saying you know uh fords really making some hay with
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:28.800]   voice control uh notice fort is not in the group that is going to be adopting this
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:33.520]   um maybe we should that we can jump on easily jump on the bandwagon just by incorporating
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:39.280]   serie it does look like the apple maps are you know on screen and uh messaging is on on screen
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:43.200]   they'll read messages you can dictate messages it's uh looks like a full serie implementation
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.480]   but you're right Andy it's only going to be in luxury vehicles you're not going to see this and uh
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:50.800]   oh it's nice it's nice i'm not i'm not being great well yeah luxury vehicles like the key i know but
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:56.400]   well it's i mean the you goes not getting it i'm not i'm not but i'm not begrudging it's just that
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:01.440]   it's not the sort of announcement that i think gets should get anybody excited about the future
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:07.680]   direction of ios and the mercedes and the other things are chevy achura kia on day volvo
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:13.200]   wait a minute that's accurate what's the one above that i don't know what's the z Tesla
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:19.200]   and jaguar i don't know what this what are the infinity infinity uh it's infinity of course and
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:23.040]   what's that that's infinity no the hell's that anybody know the flash
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:29.920]   and he's right berry allen or fall west i think you know the answer
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:39.280]   anyway eddie's happy about ferariate so are we um yeah i think one more sorry go ahead one more
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:45.840]   story from wwdc yesterday was uh automatic updates oh yeah the john mccain and john mccain's
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:50.880]   reply on twitter yeah he did thanks thanks to tim cook for the automatic iphone updates
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:56.800]   hashtag apple hashtag wwdc from john mccain's official account john mccain has binders full of
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:02.000]   social media specifically i think it was a deal with apple because of the name mavericks as well
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:08.400]   which john mccain was an abric right so he should have tweeted that how interesting so he did in fact
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:15.280]   and you know people didn't you know give them a little trouble for uh being unclear but actually
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:19.520]   i think he was asking a question a lot of us wanted which is can you please turn on i'm not happy about
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:26.960]   going to that uh you know uh icon every time and seeing 40 updates that i have to do manually it's
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:31.840]   send john mccain he has to open his presence every day it starts to get boring but the big
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:36.240]   but the big question is are we going to have the option of declining automatic updates how many
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:40.240]   times have you been sort of poorly borked by the fact that they pushed out an update that removed a
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.320]   feature or a buggy update that you didn't download because you've been ringing about the firestorm
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:50.080]   online about it by the way apparently john mccain is also welcoming hilly clinton to twitter that's
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.280]   that's the other thing he's doing he's the head of the twitter chamber parley
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:01.040]   the big lead squad that uh tim cook a tweet got one thousand ninety retweets and 354 favorites
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:05.280]   so john's got the social media laws one fifth of the people who want to know anything he knows what he's
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:11.760]   doing wow that's impressive congratulations john for your thousand retweet tweet yeah that's a good
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:17.280]   number a star any other big stories uh erin uh as a developer you were you know erin is the
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:21.760]   is the audience for this all of this year yeah no no big stories really a lot of the stuff is the
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.080]   same i'm not too worried about updating the books i think i have to redo the screen shots a lot
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:31.360]   uh we do have to rewrite a bunch of apps but that's expected that's cosmetic yeah just change the
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:37.760]   resources everything else can stay the same well yeah right right um and there but there are new
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.560]   apis are there significant changes in the apis no not really okay they're not very deep all right
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.680]   uh all right let's take a break come back with our tips and tricks and they're about
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:53.920]   so for you newbies scott and erin you know anything you want to say is cool and wonderful all right
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.480]   you could do it you're not that new by definition by definition anything you say is cool and wonderful
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:06.400]   our show today brought to you by squarespace.com if you are a web uh user you probably know that
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:11.440]   some not all websites are created equal some websites are just beautiful by nature they
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:16.480]   reformat perfectly when you look at them on a small screen or a big screen they they just seem
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:22.080]   to work they never go down that's probably a squarespace site squarespace never goes down
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:29.040]   because they have integrated the content management software with the hosting in a beautiful way
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:33.760]   all of their designs are mobile responsive that means you don't get a kind of a separate mobile
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:38.800]   site you you get a site that looks great no matter what size screen in fact all the images that you
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:44.640]   upload to your website whether you're a photographer designer blogger uh automatically are sized
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:49.440]   i think they do seven different thumbnails to make sure that they'll look great no matter what
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:55.360]   size screen they're on it's very easy to post very easy to design it's all drag and drop point
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.800]   and click but if you're a developer of course they've got a great developer platform that makes it
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:07.520]   easy that we're including uh syntax code colored syntax and uh and so forth uh just a really great

[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:35.680]   website like inside to it all right final thoughts on macbreak weekly let's start with rene richy
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:39.120]   what is your pick of the week my pick of the week is an app called vesper
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:43.840]   full disclosure the designer is a friend of mine dave whiskers he worked on it with bret simmons
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:49.120]   who's a legend did not use wire worked with dave liner he's an amazing developer also is john
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:54.240]   groober of daring fireball and they did sort of uh michael lop thing where they had a designer a
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:47:00.000]   developer and a dictator and they use that so yeah so the designer's job is so the developer's job is
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.600]   to make the architecture the designer's job is to make it human and the dictator is supposed to
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:10.000]   choose in between them what a good idea absolutely it's it's a new agile well i mean it's a very
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.400]   apple-esque way of designing things and their goal with vesper was to tear down like i don't know
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.840]   whether it was supposed to be a to-do app or a list i saw like a to-do app or a notes app but it
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:22.400]   ended up being somewhere in between and they sort of before ios 7 they tore it down towards
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:27.440]   component parts and they added just the most minimal possible feature sets so you can add a note
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:32.720]   or a list item and you can tag it and it works very similarly to os 10s really gorgeous yeah
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:38.800]   buto very flat minimalistic design um the name vesper of course james bond inspired which is
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.840]   and they have credits in the app that are very james bond esque and it's it's notable for several
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:48.160]   reasons one it's incredibly highly opinionated you get the choice of one font the one that they
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:54.160]   like the workflow is you know sort of john groobers workflow for how notes should be done there's no
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.680]   sink there's no importer export it is a 1.0 and uh it's sort of in the michael jurewitz philosophy
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:04.080]   they're charging real money for it they're charging five dollars i like that for the app and i love
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:08.400]   that because developers deserve to get paid they have children to support families to support i
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:12.480]   dislike the theory that if you charge less you will eventually make it up on the volume of zero
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:18.240]   and i list your ways in well i mean there's sort of it goes back to to that will shipling
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:21.840]   analogy about miners versus farmers where you know they want to build a business they don't want to
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:26.800]   get bought out by another company and there's a lot of things that this app does not do that a lot
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:31.920]   of other task managers or list manager apps does do do but if your workflow happens to be
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.320]   somewhat of john groobers and you like the design aesthetic and the style of it uh then you can be
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:42.080]   a very highly effective because it's it's almost letter press esque uh when you use it it's there's
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.240]   no textures but there's a lot of three it's it's a three-dimensional interface you can slide things
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:51.280]   aside it bounces back very charmingly this little you know shake when the text comes back into place
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:56.400]   and i was a one of the beta testers and they were incredibly responsive they had literally a
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:00.480]   who's who of beta testers on this app and whenever new features were arranged they very carefully
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:06.240]   went through them and decided on them and they have a very good roadmap going forward and i was
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:10.640]   i've been using it i don't know if in light of current you know intelligence disclosures being
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:16.560]   offline like andy's battle for galactica computer is an advantage in some cases but this app lets
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:21.920]   you have just a local list almost like a field notes on your iphone galactica of notes i like it
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:26.320]   yeah and uh i would recommend people to try it it's gonna they knew going in it was going to be
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:29.520]   very divisive because some people would love it some people would hate it but if you're the kind
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:33.520]   of person for whom this appeals it's a very nice app to use well evernote which it has all the
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:37.760]   functionality so damn ugly yeah that i think there is probably a market for something that is more
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:42.960]   appealing visually this is huge branch is the publisher yeah there so their idea for a queue i was
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:48.240]   uh we get a queue branch get it get it get it yeah we interviewed them uh on debug john and uh
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.600]   and dave and brent uh and they went through they explained exactly why they made the
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:55.760]   decisions they did but they wanted to be cubed branch because q makes the toys for james bond and
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.160]   they want to make stuff that makes you feel like james bond got it what is the vesper i don't know
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:04.880]   vesper was vesper lion was the first bond girl in casino royale and they have a martini named after
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:13.200]   her wow okay that is that's a little obscure yes all right uh scott can ask her your pick of the week
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:20.960]   my pick is an ios app called g music and it's a it it's an app for playing google music and my
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:27.840]   disclosure is i work for google but i'll tell a quick story um to disavow any favoritism behind
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:36.720]   that and the pick um i've been enjoying playing music on computers since um a long time ago let's say
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:42.320]   and before you could actually put music from cds onto computers before cds existed i've been
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:47.280]   fascinated by the idea of playing music on computers and when when sound jam arrived for the mac
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:53.360]   back in never that was yeah and more became the two yeah it was a game i didn't right yeah uh
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:57.040]   and you could actually take your music off of cds and put them on the computer and then the
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:02.160]   iTunes store uh that was fantastic you're probably still in in google music you still have some of
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:08.080]   those original ribs that i do it with sound and if i had used nadir and i use naps or a lot i have
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:12.160]   gigabytes from naps i probably have some of them yeah that i use uh all my metallic music is from
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:18.640]   naps yeah so i just do that to make a lot of you go you go you go through your iTunes library you
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:23.920]   see those eight tracks that were ripped at 96k you know oh some of those things better in
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:32.480]   96k here's a here's a here's a band i was really into it 1995 so i i've been kind of wanting the perfect
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:39.120]   at least for me because music is very idiosyncratic listening to music is is an individual pursuit i've
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:46.080]   been wanting an app for a long time or a mechanism that provides music that i can own that i have
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:51.040]   control of forever because music on music stores sometimes goes away right sometimes is posted for
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:55.120]   a while then you go back the next week and it's not there anymore i want music that i can buy and
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:00.640]   have forever i want music that i can play on a subscription basis so if i kind of like it or i
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:06.960]   want to try to do all axis does it have the google radio yeah it does it's it's a google music so
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.640]   when google music all axis came out a few weeks ago it was my perfect service right and i couldn't
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:18.000]   believe it because i kept trying well can it do this can i make a playlist that mix mixes songs i own
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.720]   with songs i don't own yes you can can you put it on your mobile device yes you can and i checked
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:28.800]   off all my items until i got to ios and there's no ios client well it turns out the g music is a
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:35.440]   pretty good ios client and excellent ios client for google music all axis and the author updated it
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:43.360]   over the weekend after it was uh after all access came out now so with g music which is a free app
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:49.200]   you can i think it's a free app i may have paid a little for it and forgot but uh you know anything
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:57.360]   under 20 bucks is free right it's way under 20 bucks i can access all my subscription music all my
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:04.960]   all the music i've bought and i believe a couple weeks ago uh sundar patchi from google announced
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:09.040]   that google's working on an ios client but don't know when that's going to come out he said in a
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:16.080]   few weeks well how many is a few i don't know it could be 52 it could be 52 yeah anyway i'm really
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:22.320]   happy with g music i use it a lot and it's pretty close to it with google music google play music
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:29.440]   all axis it is pretty much my dream uh music client music system spotify was almost there
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.920]   and google is a step beyond that which is which is pretty cool because the previous uh incarnation
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:40.080]   of google music was not that interesting to me it didn't really do enough that i want it yeah
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:44.080]   well it's nice because you have your google musical you have your collection in it but then
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:47.280]   it adds the radio which i guess is kind of well yeah that's right i forgot to even say it also
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:52.640]   has the radio features pandora or iTunes radio right style radio feature right uh in addition to
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:57.120]   well that's what i yeah and that's new and that's uh that's great yeah i'm looking for Cindy Loper but
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:02.080]   uh finally took it all oh i was gonna you don't deserve to have it
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:08.160]   wait let me get my kinky boots on here all right my pick was gonna be Neil Patrick Harris's opening
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:13.680]   number from the Tony i stole your jimmy pick you gotta see it it's amazing all right g music app
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:18.800]   it is a great app and i've been using it and i will continue to use it until google uh does a uh
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:24.080]   uh google music app for and maybe even beyond if they do a better job maybe maybe i use the uh
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:28.560]   the app of course on android and it's great the google app on it it's great they've really done
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:33.360]   it's and just for the record it's a dollar ninety nine on the uh apps close enough to free
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:37.600]   close very close to free erin hilly gas your pick of the week yes i hate to do this but i'm
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:42.960]   gonna pimp my own stuff no you should because big nerd ranch you know we're best known for training
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:49.440]   and contract programming on ios and android and html five um but every couple of years we see a
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.200]   niche that we think somebody should have taken care of this and we actually write the app and
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:57.840]   sell it ourselves love that we just shipped one we're really excited about it's ruminant with two
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:06.240]   o's so it's r o o m i n and a n t and i spell it right ruminant that's right and uh it's a conference
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:12.960]   room scheduling app the app itself is free and the uh we charge by the month based on how many
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:17.200]   conference rooms you want us to manage for we got one so if you have a gazillion employees and you
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:22.400]   have one conference room which is the problem is really cheap for you awesome so you tried to make
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:26.160]   the price proportional to how big of a conference room problem you have yeah well the problem is
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:29.600]   we have two companies using one conference room so this is good five dollars a room per month and
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:34.240]   it's not limited to any particular group of people you just add them the email addresses in and and
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:41.440]   and it can be making a note of it ruminant ruminant with two o's and it's ruminant.com if you want to
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:47.040]   uh look at it on the web and of course you have you have apps for what platforms right now it's
[01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:53.680]   just web and iOS web and we'll be doing android and windows 8 for long that is a by the way a
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:58.320]   reminder that they do teach android programming that's right and we actually just shipped our
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:03.360]   android book which is excellent if you go to amazon and people raving about the back of the book
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:12.720]   book oh that's great um everybody should visit big nerd ranch dot com it's a good look in sight
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:16.960]   too thank you sledge on yeah and an echo i think you're gonna wrap it up with your pick of the
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:23.280]   week is it is it Neil patrick heres uh no i have two picks uh one is the cindy lopper
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:30.000]   last which i'll just bring in here my my my friend cindy here what was her uh broadway what
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:36.160]   did she get a tony for for kinky boots composing composing music for in kinky boots yes uh but
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:41.200]   in all in all seriousness this is this is her this is her album of like of american standards
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:45.440]   and it really shows you that in the in every in every 20 years since she's so unusual
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:50.160]   she has only refined her technique and there is really nothing she can't sing
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.120]   the most beautiful tracks uh i've got in my library since seriously since your recommendation
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:00.000]   i'm not just doing it to jab but you although jabbing at you is just a nice little sidebar uh
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.960]   in terms of an action in terms of an actual mac related review i had a chance to take another
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:11.280]   look at marvel comics unlimited which is marvel comics is uh subscription based digital comic
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:16.080]   service uh when it first came out a couple years ago i didn't think much of it because it didn't work
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:21.280]   on ipads or iphones you had to be attached to a web browser uh it only had like just really they
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:27.760]   would only release comics that were really really old or could promote a movie or tv show so it really
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:32.800]   wasn't much good uh but now they've got like a really really deep catalog of titles that go back
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:39.920]   as recently as a few months ago and as old as the sixties uh they have they recently updated their
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:45.760]   created an ipad app that is not as perfect as i would like it to be it's certainly nothing compared
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:53.120]   to comicsology uh but it does allow you to read full page comics and although it does still require
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:58:00.320]   internet connection you can keep as many as six of these comics uh on the device at any time so if
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:06.560]   you're about to board a plane you can you can grab like a six issue story arc and keep it there
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:12.880]   uh for you to actually read uh send the the price so good content decent enough app the app needs a
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.560]   lot of improvement but it's a decent enough app and the pricing is also very very good if you
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:22.960]   purchase a annual subscription i believe it's sixty bucks uh a year uh which comes down to much
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:26.960]   less than four like five or six bucks per month which is certainly reasonable amount of time to
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:30.720]   have thousands and thousands and thousands of comics like it's like having that having a
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:35.520]   pathetic friend as a kid who buys all the comics and will let you read as many as you want uh just
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:40.720]   to just to be his friend yes i was that kid i'm sorry i shouldn't just make fun of that uh and uh
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:44.880]   and so it's decent enough again room for improvement but uh but a good enough value and a nice thing
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:48.640]   if you're into comics i've been using it like i've been reading every night in that app and use it
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:52.160]   on the airplane and now thanks to and they'll be reading all the john burn fantastic fours on the
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:58.880]   way back yeah that's the one where all my free ones are right it's like he said it's not a perfect
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:03.600]   interface but the content is just unbelievable especially for the price yeah if only they could
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:07.920]   get comics all get a partnership with comics all which and have their reader technology power
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:13.120]   and stuff they should because they're not because they don't want you stealing the comics well i mean
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:17.200]   i'm sure that if they could just simply say comicsology could you please give us your let us
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:22.080]   let hook up your front your beautiful reader front end to our DRM content uh that would be a good
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:26.960]   thing for for readers everywhere because they're they're times where it's like i've got the basic
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:32.880]   cbr like unlocked comics readers and they're not and this uh marvel heavily heavily produced and
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:38.960]   very expensively produced uh ios app is not as good as that like little cbr reader versus i'm now on
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:43.840]   page five and it's just locked up but it's not it's not locked up but it's not actually there you go
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:48.800]   it's like a dc version too Andy can i have a dc version please yeah i mean dc is doing some
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:53.120]   interesting things too they recently came up with uh essentially choose your own mystery
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:57.440]   choose your own adventure style comics they released it they now set an event in new york uh last
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:02.160]   tuesday night i believe uh that really is you're reading a batman story and you can decide whether
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:08.400]   you want to have batman follow a report of uh of the joker or fort that catwoman is that up
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:13.680]   somewhere or that there's an unnamed nuisance at the at the street and then follow that through
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:17.920]   and they also emotion comics so i don't know if they're going to be any more useful than all the
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:24.240]   other attempts that comic book publishers have made to do anything in a digital comic that is
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:28.800]   more complicated than simply i take the page of the comic please put it on the screen and make it
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:34.160]   legible and make the pages turn very very easily that's really really all we want uh so if they
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:37.120]   if they have a success with that then this is the first time they'll have a success success with
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:42.320]   that but it's good to see them trying at least and he not go writes for the chicago sun times he catches
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:49.600]   reviews uh there and his website c w o b dot com uh and of course he's on flicker two uh and the
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:54.400]   eye on flicker great photos great photos there thanks for joining us and it's great to see you
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:59.600]   are you glad are you glad in hindsight that you stayed home i'm not i'm not glad i mean there's a
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:03.680]   there's a trade-off there are things that you will learn when you're there that you will not learn
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:07.280]   from your sofa because there's so many other people you could meet up with and talk to i'm sorry
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:12.000]   that didn't have a chance to have breakfast with uh with scottum so i'm glad i'm i'm not glad at all
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.600]   that i'm not gonna have a chance to have uh have dinner with you guys tonight but on the other hand
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:21.520]   there's something to if your job is to generate analysis and thoughtful commentary about about a
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:25.840]   really complicated keynote there's something about being able to watch it from a sofa with proper
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:30.640]   hydration and being able to simply screenshot anything that you want to take notes on later
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:36.480]   that because if i were doing that in san francisco i'd have i'd be balancing my notebook on my knees
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:41.680]   and this really cramp little little little chair and then i have to find okay find a Starbucks that
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:45.200]   that has a free space where i can sit for an hour and a half because i got to file something

[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:02.640]   gonna be one that's on the phone oh well i'm sorry if if there were to be an iOS event i thought you
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.480]   might have might have known you something there there there are two there's lip there
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:10.320]   fact factor number one was the was the fact that i knew that this is gonna be live-screen but factor
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:14.960]   number two is that in the iOS event you really want to have your hands on these devices and actually
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:18.960]   touch and feel them uh and that would not have that opportunity there's nothing like that going on
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:23.920]   uh yeah so you could have looked at a distance at the mac pro plus like i said i got i just blew
