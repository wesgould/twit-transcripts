[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Leo LePourt here and we are pleased to say that
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Apple has for once made an announcement before we record
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   the show.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Let's say, yay.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Scott Borne is here from twpphoto.com, this week
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   in photography.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Also our official Mac bigot.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   If it's not Mac, you could throw it back.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   That is correct.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Yes.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   You are correct, sir.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Chris Breen, the Mac Daddy from Macworld magazine,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   his senior editor at Macworld magazine.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Chris, thanks for joining us.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Great to be here again, Leo.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   We're going to make you use the phone since you are out in
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   the boonies and your Skype is inconsistent.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I hope people will forgive me that.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Yes, no, it will blame Skype.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Blame Skype.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It's all Skype's fault.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Also with us, Mr. Andy Inaco from the Celestial Waste
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   of bandwidth and the Chicago Sun-Times Eye.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Andy?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Hello.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We've all been watching before the show.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We've all been watching the Apple announcements, so it's
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   over now so we can actually talk about it.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Also, to give us some PC perspective, because some of
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   what we're seeing is, in fact, parts that are more common
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   on PCs than on Macs, Ryan Shroud, from PCPerspective.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   PCPer.com is a great enthusiast blog.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And Ryan was the one who broke the story yesterday about
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   the Nvidia chipset.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And he actually has the Nvidia chipset in some other boards
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and knows a lot about it, also about these graphics.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Ryan, thanks for joining us.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Great to have you all.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So let me just recap a little bit of what happened.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Starting with the rumor sites were right in almost every
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   respect.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Kevin Rose missed this one.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   No Blu-ray drive.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   But we do have a MacBook Pro made out of a single brick of
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   aluminum.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   We have three new MacBooks, a $9.99, not $800, but $9.99 low end.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Plastic, white plastic MacBook.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   We have two new MacBooks made out of aluminum.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   All of the new Macs, all the new Notebooks have LED
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   backlit displays.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   The higher end ones, except for the, I don't know what the
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   $9.99 display looks like, but the higher end ones have
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   displays that are just like the iMac displays with the
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   black border, they're all glass all the way to the edge.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Much thinner, noticeably thinner, there are two new MacBook
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Pros, two new 15 inches, I guess I should say.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And these MacBook Pros all have, as I said, that same LED
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   backlit display.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   By the way, all of them have the new glass touch pads, no buttons.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Steve Jobs finally got his wish, a buttonless mouse.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It remains to be seen how that will work.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I guess you'll tap to click.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's more like having an iPhone, I guess.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Black keyboards all round.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   The MacBook Pros are made out of a single brick of aluminum
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   for the bottom part, which the keyboard isn't set into.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Hard drive sizes are much bigger.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   SSD drives options on all of the new MacBooks.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But the biggest story, I think, and that's why Ryan is here,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   is Apple is abandoning the Intel chipset that is used up
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   to now and moving to an Nvidia chipset, which gives it
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   some real advantages, including some new Macs.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Some new Nvidia video cards.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Ryan, tell us a little bit about the chips that are used in these.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So the integrated graphics chips that they're using
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   is called the GeForce 9400M.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And this is a single chip solution that offers all of the
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   features that chips have, but normally have your memory
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   controller, you know, controls the PCI Express bus,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   SATA, that kind of stuff, and also adds in the integrated
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   graphics core with it.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   So the benefit of this is you get three to four times the
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   graphics performance that you would have got using Intel's
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   integrated graphics solution that were on previous MacBooks
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   and in the MacBook Air as well.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   So you get a big boost in any kind of gaming performance
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   that they might want to include there.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And obviously, usually for Macs, gaming is not on the forefront
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   there.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So it'll be interesting to see how that changes now that they're
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   kind of taking that into consideration.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   They also have the ability to offer features like hybrid
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   power.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   They didn't really mention it by that name during the keynote
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   or session, whatever you want to call it today.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   But it basically gives you the ability to include both the
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   integrated graphics and a discrete graphics solution from
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Nvidia that you can switch between without having to
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   reboot your system or anything like that.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And it allows you to save power and use the integrated graphics
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   when you want to or when you need the graphics performance,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   you can use a discrete part.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So this is within one system.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I think this is in all the MacBook Pros.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah, I think it's only the MacBook Pros.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah, because there are MacBook Airs as well.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Oh, there's Alex Lindsay.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Let's let Alex into the call.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Hey, Alex, welcome.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Can you hear me better?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Yeah, that's much better.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So this Nvidia chipset allows you to do something a little
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   weird, which is it has integrated graphics, motherboard
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   graphics.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   That's the 9400M graphics.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   But it also has a discrete graphics chip.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   If you want to get higher speed graphics and I presume more
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   graphics memory that's not coming out of RAM, you would switch
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   to the discrete chip.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Is that right?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   That's correct.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And your battery life goes down by about 20%.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Yeah, he said from five hours to four hours, I'd be curious.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I would expect it to be a little bit more than that.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   But you'd get less battery life.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Right.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Did you see more difference than that?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   So give us an idea of how fast this 9600GT is.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It's not a desktop speed graphics card.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   The 9600GT, it could be if you consider the desktop cards,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I would equate it to maybe a desktop card selling for $80,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   $90.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   That type of gaming performance.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Hey Leo, I'm sending you a file you need to accept.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Is that what that sound is?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   All right.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Is this your order?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   That's a copy of it.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Okay.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Somebody asked in the chat room how it compared to the old
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   graphics in the MacBook Pro.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And I think we just, we were just talking about that.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   The old MacBook Pro uses an 8600GTPU.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The new 9600 probably won't be dramatically faster than that in
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   terms of gaming performance.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   So you will see a bump, but you get a little bit of a feature
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   increase and the 8600 was not compatible with the hybrid power
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   technology in the Nvidia 9400 chipset.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   According to Apple,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   things like aperture will be sped up about 50% because of its
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   reliance on GPU.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   That's the kind of thing you want to see is because people, I don't
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   know if gaming is still very important on the Mac side.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Exactly.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Not many games, but well, I presume Photoshop would also
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   benefit from that.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Likewise, around the same 50% in some of the higher end processes
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   like Gaussian blur, et cetera.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Did they say that during the event today?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Because I was looking for that and I didn't see that come up.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   That was one of my big.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   That was on a press piece that was sent to me by Apple.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   So I don't know if they published it yet, but that's what they're
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   claiming.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And I can get that to Leo if he didn't get it, but it's they
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   lift several different performance benchmarks.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And those were just two of the ones that caught my eye being a
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   photographer.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And that's the way I like to look.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I mean, I'm sure the gamers want to know from a gaming perspective.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Right.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That's actually one of the big selling points why I kind of
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   decided this was going to be the way to go is because Apple had
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   been pushing OpenCL, which is the Open Compute language that
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   was this new chipset, the integrated graphics core and it
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   supports and Nvidia had been promoting its new partnership
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   with Adobe for speed up a Photoshop and Premiere using their
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   graphics technology as well, which would work in the integrated
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   graphics as well as the discrete graphics there.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So yeah, I agree.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It would be more professional oriented than gaming oriented,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   but I didn't see any of that come up during the event today,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   which I thought was surprising.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   They focused on the gaming as if that's an important business
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   for them, which is not.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Well, and I know as a user like motion should be, Apple's
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   motion should be accelerated a lot as well.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Yeah, that would be what.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   So not all programs rely on the GPU does, for instance, Final Cut?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Final Cut doesn't as much as a program like motion is very heavily
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   attached to the GPU.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I was actually just showing it at a conference a minute ago.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And that kind of stuff should be sped up a lot, having an
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   extra, I mean, because you're kind of stuck with whatever you get with
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   your Mac Pro rather than being able to add something else.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And so it's pretty exciting, I think, that being able to work on
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   the road will be a lot easier doing presentations, et cetera.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   It should be able to, in the future, support Final Cut or speed up
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Final Cut, one of the things that NVIDIA's GPUs that they've been
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   showing off an AMD as well is the ability to transcode video
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   and encode video much, much faster than the processor can.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   And that's another function that could be moved to the GPU, both
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   integrated and discrete, you know, if Apple's willing to work with
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   NVIDIA and set up the software and that kind of thing to do so.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   The air has always been kind of --
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Go ahead.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   All I was going to say is that's kind of always been the
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   pushing pool with NVIDIA and Apple is that Apple doesn't want to, I
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   mean, the -- it sounds like Apple doesn't want to give up what
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   they need to do for NVIDIA to write the driver and then NVIDIA
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   doesn't want to write, you know, they want to -- NVIDIA
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   wants to write its own drivers.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Apple wants to write its own drivers.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And so there's this push back and forth.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So hopefully we will see enough.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   They'll get enough of a pipe in --
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   NVIDIA was very cooperative.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   You're Ryan pointed out before we began that NVIDIA has put off
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   its announcement of this chipset till tomorrow.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Right.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   They've had this plan for months.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   You know, the chipset's been done for a long time.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   They're basically waiting for --
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   They're waiting for Apple to announce.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Which, you know, I mean, Apple's a big customer.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I would imagine that maybe not as big as Xbox or something,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   but I mean, imagine they put enough units out that this is
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   something that NVIDIA is willing to cooperate and work with them,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I would think.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I don't know if it'll -- how much it will affect NVIDIA's bottom
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   line exactly because of the volume of it.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Right.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   But as far as getting a --
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   You know, in the --
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   In the -- In the -- In the -- Exactly, exactly.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   You're going to be in the media now.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Early November, we will get new MacBook Airs.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   There's not really much to say there.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   1.6 gigahertz, 1.8 gigahertz, two gigs of memory in both of them.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   There's 120 gigahertz drive now in the low end,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   128 gig solid state drive in the high end one.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Both will have much improved graphics because they will also
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   have this 9400M chipset.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   So the 9400M, again, that's motherboard graphics,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   integrated graphics as opposed to the 9600GT,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   which is the extra graphics chip on the MacBook Pro.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   For air users, though, Apple's claiming a four-time speed
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   improvement in graphics.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Does that seem right, Ryan?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Especially compared to previous Intel products, yeah.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Also support for the 30-inch display, which is nice.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   You have that dual DVI capability.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   So the air isn't much changed.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   In fact, what's really happened is that the MacBook Pros are much
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   more like the air.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   The air is still there, but I think that a lot of people,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   for the same price as a high-end air, are going to perhaps look at
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   that MacBook Pro.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   The new MacBook Pro configuration, I mean, I just configured mine.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I don't want to say what the discount was, but even at retail
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   is at least about $1,000 less than I paid for the last MacBook Pro
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   I got.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Right.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Now, the 17's not much changed.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   They've given it a speed bump and so forth, but it sounds like
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   they're really focused on this.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I mean, who's going to buy a 17 with this new 15, unless you really
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   do that.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Well, not me thanks to the advice that you guys gave me.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   You thought about it though.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I thought about Paul, because that's what I usually buy.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I usually just buy the one that's got every history.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   But, yeah.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Chris, can you bring your reactions to this so far?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Well, about the 17, it's the one Apple laptop now that you can still
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   get an anti-glare matte screen.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   They're all glossy now.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   They're all glossy.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And with no option for matte?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   No, not for the 15.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   The 17 has got it.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   That's a bit of a shock.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   No, they said in the Q&A they were going all glass.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Yep.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I'm going to ask.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Glass equals glossy.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Right.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And Firewire has sort of been shoved into a dinghy being dragged
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   behind the boat now.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   So, there's no Firewire on the MacBook and only 800 on the Pro.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Yeah, notice they didn't mention that there was no Firewire on the
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   MacBook.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   It's in the back.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   No.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   They just left it out during the Christmas.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Wow.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Well, I wouldn't expect them to point out what they don't have.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   So, we were debating back and forth what hard drive Scott should put
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   in his notebook, bro.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And the choice was he didn't want the 5400 stock, 5400 RPM, 320 gig
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   drive.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   So, for 50 bucks you could add a 7200, 320 gig drive.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Or you go to solid state for another 500 bucks.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And Ryan, you like the solid state.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I am a fan of the solid state drives.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   My last two notebooks that I've bought have had them.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Like I was saying earlier, it depends a lot on what your usage
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   model is.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   I can get away with 128 gigs of storage in my notebook because
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   it's not my primary machine.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   My primary machine is still a desktop.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   But the speed up that you get in the hibernate and some of the
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   different applications you use, especially if you do.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   If you do a lot of video work and you'll see a pretty big
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   boost in that kind of performance as well if you move to a solid
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   state drive versus a traditional.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   That'll nudge it up to 3000.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   There's also a third party, you know, the third party drives
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   now that are 500 at 72.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I think it's only 200, but there's definitely 500 gig drives as
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   well.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   You just would need to buy the base one and then have someone swap
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   it out.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I mean, they're like 80 bucks or something.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And it looks like you won't have to have someone swap it out.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   The new cases are very accessible for hard drive swaps.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Right.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Andy, what's your thoughts so far?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Just great incremental improvements all around.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I mean, it's one of the last time that Jonathan and I was
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   actually on stage and he was on what would look like for what
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   15 minutes just talking about the tooling and it manufacturing
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   process that went into turning this two and a half pound block
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   of block of aluminum into this wonderful high speed, whatever
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   casing.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   But all the things that I really love about these new laptops are
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   just the idea of having, again, better video, just the idea of
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   having drives and memory that are trivially easy to get at me.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It really is designed for a college student to do it in the
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   middle of a lecture while they're not taking notes or paying
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   attention.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   That easy.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   That's just that easy.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Also, I'm really interested in, I think that one of the sleeper
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   announcements was the fact that they made the trackpad not only
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   buttonless, but it's much, much bigger.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   It's made out of glass.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   And now they've added four finger gestures.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   This definitely is a transition to just making that input area
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   bigger and bigger and bigger and making it into just as credible
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   and input system as the keyboard.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   It's almost now a tablet input system practically.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   You're going to see a video screen behind it.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   You're going to mean you really see the investment that Apple is
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   making in creating a brand new idea of how you interact with
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   the machine.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   I'm really keen on it.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I thought that was kind of, okay, fine.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   So if I use two fingers, I can scroll up and down.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Okay, fine.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   That's nice.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And you just sort of missed that they're actually the monkeys are
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   experimenting it with the walls of the cage and seeing how far they
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   can push things out.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And now we're actually seeing them making their first big.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   They've cracked open the door a long, wide enough that some of
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   the bad moves can get out and wreak havoc.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Wow.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   That's very interesting.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   How big is it?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Do we know what the measurements are?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.400]   It's about four inches wide, isn't it?
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   So that's pretty big.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   It's almost it.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   It's about 30, 32 percent bigger.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.720]   Yeah, they're bigger.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.400]   I don't know how people are going to react to the lack of a button.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   Yeah, I mean, I, the one of the first things I do, Mac or PC,
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   whenever I break out a new laptop is turn off the button tapping
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   feature of the trackpad because I have never had a single trackpad
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   that actually made that work without getting false button taps in.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   So if they can make that, if they can crack that and make it useful,
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   great.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.400]   If they can't, then I've got 30 bucks in my wallet for whoever who can
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   just sell me a USB button.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   Just a button, I can just stick next to the trackpad and have a
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   physical button to tap.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.400]   Right.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   Hmm.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   Either that or a good old fashioned mouse that you can click on.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   Right.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   Right.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   There's no reason why you couldn't use a mouse.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   The people looks like the people in the chat room are saying the
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   trackpad is a button that there's a spring.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   Yeah, I read that somewhere on one of the.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   That's what they did with the blackberry touch.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   I mean, a storm is that you click it.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400]   That is weird.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   I don't know if I can get used to that.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   I don't know if that's going to be reliable.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   That gets me a little bit worried.
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   I don't like like moving parts in there.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.400]   The trackpad has no button.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   It is the button with a smooth, smooth glass surface.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   This spacious trackpad brings even more multi touch gestures and
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   function.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   It's not clear.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   I guess maybe in the announcement they were clear that you click it.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   It is the button.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   I got to be.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.400]   I got a feeling that if that doesn't work, I'm going to be using
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   a gesture Apple did not demonstrate today.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   I do like the screens.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   I have to say I'm glad Apple's gone to LED back.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   I know people will complain the fact that they're all glass at
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   the glass now.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   I think these are beautiful screens.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   Mirror is the screen on the iMac which is gorgeous as well.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   Speaking of screens, 24 inch, cinema display.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   Yes, not out till November.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   November, but I think they did that for me.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   I sent an email saying that's what I wanted.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   More importantly, the price is now competitive with Dell and
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   others who have been making 24 inch displays for $8.00
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.400]   for some time.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   I love a 24 inch display.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   It's our standard display for our new stuff.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   Apple says it's going to price it at what?
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400]   $900 which is a.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   My iMac 24 inch is perfect.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   I've got 30 inch cinema display sitting here in a box I'm not
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.400]   using because I prefer the 24.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   And plus it'll power your laptop because it's got a mag
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.400]   safe connector on it.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   Oh, that's very very good.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   So it has the mag safe so you can connect your laptop to it.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   Right.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   So you don't have to plug in a separate power supply.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   It's just, you know, it's not exactly a dock, but it's pretty
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   darn close.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   That's cool.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   That's very cool.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.400]   Yeah, I think Apple learned with its duo that you don't really
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.400]   need to stick it in to get the benefit.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   Also, USB ports, three USB ports, self powered.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   It's kind of a bitch.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   We've been thinking the cinema display upgrade's been coming
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   for a long time.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   Leo, did we think it was going to be 24 inch?
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   No.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.400]   And a built in camera too, which is something that they very much
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   needed.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.400]   And by the way, something I don't think Dell gateway, any of the
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   big 24 inch displays have cameras.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   Do any of them have cameras, Ryan?
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   I don't think so.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   I don't know.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.400]   I don't think so.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   I was just going to point out the Dell sells for like $600 to
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   24 inch.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   Well, but there's a cheap Dell and there's a good Dell.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   Yeah, we bought the cheaper one, man.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   That was a horrible experience.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   Much higher contrast ratio.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   I don't know, but I would guess that the Apple is comparable to
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   the higher end Dell.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   In terms of contrast ratio, they, of course, they don't say.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.400]   I'm just looking through here.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.400]   I still think the Apple one is a little bit higher price.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   I'm seeing two.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   There's a 419 and a 619 from Dell.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   The 619 is 3,000 to 1.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.400]   Oh, all right.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.400]   That's their higher end.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   That's the higher end one.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.400]   Boy, they keep dropping the price on that sucker.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.400]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   Contrast ratio on the new.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   It's a thousand, oh boy, 1,000 to 1 on the new Apple.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   So it isn't that high contrast ratio.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.400]   Well, but keep in mind there's different ways of measuring that
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   and that's not the only spec that you would look at to determine
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.400]   whether or not you like the blacks.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   Response to L1 says 1,300 to 1 static 3,000 to 1 dynamic.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   Ah, okay.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.400]   Response time slow 14 milliseconds.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   Speaking of slow response time, if anyone goes to the store,
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   if anyone wonders how exciting it's crashing,
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   it's crashing.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   A lot of interest in buying this.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   I got my order in first.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   You already pressed the button, huh?
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   I sent you the receipt.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   Oh, yeah, I see it.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   I just didn't want to know.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   I just, you know.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.400]   That's the best shows you all the way that they'll configure it.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.400]   Yeah, they're very cool.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   Very cool.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.400]   I've been trying to get back on to order a second when I can't.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   You should always use, you know, when you see that, how many just
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   make it two every time.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.400]   Well, I wanted to get a slightly different one.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.400]   Oh, just for fun.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   Yes.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   They are still selling.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   Some people are saying, where is the 30?
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.400]   Of course, they're still selling the 30 inch.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   They're not abandoning that.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   Oh, the store says we'll be back soon now.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.400]   Ah, it just got word that the UK store is also crashing from
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   Shash and the German store is open.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   A lot of interest in this new hardware.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   I think that investors are trying to move their money out of money
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.400]   market funds and into new Macbooks.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.400]   And this'll be taste like Apple.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.400]   It's better than gold coins.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   Let's just check what Apple's stock price did.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   Of course, none of this is news.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.400]   Apple's stock price is now down five bucks, about four percent,
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.400]   four or five percent.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   What does that think?
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.400]   The number is one.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   It's still pretty good.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.400]   It's 104.75.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   So that's a nice bounce up from a couple of days ago.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.400]   Yeah, down to 92 at the lowest.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   Does anybody think that the timing is a little bit odd?
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   Are we used to seeing new notebooks in the fall?
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   Well, the problem is you missed the college crowd.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   If you want to do it for the fall, you do it.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   You didn't miss the Christmas buying season, but you know what?
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   We're in a recession.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   I don't know if this is going to be a big buying season.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   Not for folks.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   It looks like it's going to be a big buying season for Apple.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   I mean, whether it is for everybody else, I'm not so sure.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.400]   You know, with inflation, your dollars are going to be worthless in a few
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.400]   weeks anyway.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.400]   Mine is going to buy them back.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.400]   Faculty.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   Get a buy back before they start printing the dollars.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.400]   Get in at the low price.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.400]   We'll be here on the Apple Store about three weeks from now.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   And these will be 7,000 bucks.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.400]   Wow.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   But you know, Alex has seen that.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   Isn't that right, Alex?
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.400]   Oh, I know all about things changing by the day.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.400]   It's a good way.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.400]   Any other thoughts on this?
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.400]   How about the error?
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   We disappointed that there wasn't something cooler in the air.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   It really is.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.400]   It's really the announcements are really about the MacBooks and the
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   MacBook Pro here.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   I mean, the error is not.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   It's just just like the 17 is just kind of bumped.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   I mean, the whole story is about evolution and not revolution.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   So there's just nothing here that would cause, you know, if you were
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   lined up at the Apple Store for the past nine days for this, you have
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   enough reason to be seriously chuffed right now.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   You know, seriously disappointed in yourself right now.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   Kevin Rose wrong about Blu-ray.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   Although, Ryan's pointing out something interesting.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   The chip set that they're using has support for Blu-ray.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   The integrated graphics core does do H.264 decode acceleration.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   I mean, that's not strictly for Blu-ray.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   So if you play back H.264 HD video that you download from the iTunes
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   store as well.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   A lot of H.264 on the Apple side.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   So it benefits from that.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   So anywhere that's used.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   So.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   I'm surprised I didn't say that because Apple is so strong on H.264.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   It confirms our, you know, what you're doing, Alex, everything you
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   met, all the videos H.264, everything we're going to do is H.264.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   I think that, I mean, when you see Google committing to that, Apple
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   committing to that, I mean, yeah, it definitely is the way, the wave of
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   the future.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   But if you wanted to put a Blu-ray disc in a machine that had this
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   graphics chip set, you would certainly benefit the chip set does the
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.400]   decoding, not the CPU.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.400]   So.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.400]   Great for playing back.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.400]   It's more power efficient that way.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   And it's faster too.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   Better battery life.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   Yep.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.400]   How thin or thick are these?
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   I, now that I can't.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   They're quite a bit thinner than they were.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   That's the thinnest MacBook Pro they've ever made according to
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   Steve.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   And they're doing the bezeling to match.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.400]   Are they doing the, yeah, they are.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   They're doing a little thin little bezel on the bottom to make it look a
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.400]   little thinner.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.400]   So they're just under an inch, they're .95 in the back of a
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.400]   machine.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.400]   And they, they're way five and a half pounds.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.400]   Five and a half pounds.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.400]   Clearly the, the things they learned on the MacBook Air have been
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.400]   applied here to the MacBook Pro.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.400]   And I personally don't think they needed to do a lot to the MacBook
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   Air because people buying the air aren't buying them to do final cut
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   and all that stuff.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   They're people like me.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.400]   I use the air when I just travel because I want to get my email and
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.400]   check the web.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   I don't care if it does final cut.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.400]   But the, the, the processes they learned there, especially this,
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   you know, hollowing out of, of one part.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   That's how they make the, the plate around the end of the air where
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   the touchpad is.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.400]   I think that's really helped them move this stuff forward.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   I'm looking at the button.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   I guess the added space to the trackpad is because they took out the
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   button.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   You push anywhere.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.400]   So it does sound like there's a click of some kind in the button.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.400]   Two figures.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   Somebody selling a click software thing you get that clicks on it.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   Maybe that's like on a digital camera.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   It's manufactured for you.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   So you, you know, when you have a little point and shoot, it makes
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   a click sound so you think you're moving the mirror on the
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   shutter.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   Two fingers scroll up and down a page, pinch to zoom in and out,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.400]   rotate an image with your fingertips, swipe with three fingers to
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   flip through your photo libraries, swipe with four fingers,
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:32.400]   which really kind of looks a little strange, to show your desktop.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.400]   I guess it's like the middle button click or view all open windows
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.400]   or switch applications.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   It's the expose button.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.400]   If you're coming from a right click world, you can right click
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   with two fingers or configure a right click area on the trackpad.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   Oh, that's kind of nice.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.400]   So you can actually go to university to figure all this new stuff out.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.400]   No, it's very cool.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   So it sounds like you could, if you click on the left side,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   that's a right, left click click on the right side.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   That's a right click.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   That would actually be kind of more intuitive than what,
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   with the way it's been.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   Hmm.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   Uh, they've, they've changed the video port now again.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   It's going to get a new video adapter.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   And of course it doesn't come bundled in.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   And you notice that like Steve was really excited about saying that
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   we can do, I know that there's an international standard port for
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   all video monitors, but we can do better than the international
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.400]   standard for all video monitors.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.400]   We can do better.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.400]   Of course.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.400]   Seems like every time they have a computer, there's a new connector
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   of some kind so they can justify another $21 cable.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.400]   Why not just add 21 bucks to the price and give us what we need?
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.400]   It seems it should come.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.400]   It always did come with it before.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.400]   I mean, it's sad that they've separated that out.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.400]   I like to just realize I didn't order that.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400]   So now I got to order that.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   Well, you can't now and I have to wait.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   Sorry.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.400]   I can't order.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   Sorry.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.400]   You're like the kid who gets the RC helicopter, but no batteries and
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   everything else on Christmas.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:02.400]   So I think we're thinking that the Blu-ray, this is Apple saying to
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.400]   Blu-ray, "Up yours, Blu-ray.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:10.400]   We're going to do HD, DVD, HD quality downloads online and we
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.400]   don't think you need an optical light."
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   Well, he sort of left that open.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   I mean, at this point, he said because of licensing issues,
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.400]   I think he termed it a bag of hurt.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.400]   Well, a bag of hurt sounds like up yours to me.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.400]   Yeah, let's talk about it.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:28.400]   I don't know exactly what a bag of hurt is, but it, it, I guess,
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   it's probably true.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   In fact, Ryan, when we were talking before the show asked and I
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   haven't seen this anywhere, if HDCP is supported on these new
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   monitors, if it's not, you can't play a Blu-ray disc back.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.400]   Ah.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   That would be a big issue.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.400]   And as far as it goes, I, I say, if you're not, when do they do
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   these refreshes every 18 months?
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.400]   If the Blu-ray is not in them now, it's not going to be.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   No, I don't think so.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.400]   And they're still not a build to order option either, either,
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:00.400]   despite Rush Limbaugh's assertion that he got them with Blu-ray built in.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:07.400]   So, it sounds to me, and I guess if you think about it, why should
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.400]   Apple support Blu-ray?
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.400]   It's a Sony product.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   Why not?
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.400]   Why not?
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.400]   You know, and Blu-ray sales are down this last quarter anyway.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.400]   This might be kind of the beginning of the end for Blu-ray.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   Well, I mean, more to the point that they're trying to convince us
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   all that you shouldn't actually buy and own a high definition movie on
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   disc, you should actually rent them or buy them as soft as DRM firmware
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.400]   software from the iTunes store.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.400]   And I think, I think for a lot of people, that might be the case.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.400]   I have to admit, I just, you know, being the person who's like behind the
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.400]   curve on everything, I bought my Blu-ray, you know, two weeks ago or something
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.400]   like that.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.400]   And I just got a PlayStation.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.400]   And I will say that the quality is much higher on a Blu-ray than it is on
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   what I download, like an HD download from iTunes.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.400]   And I don't think, I think it'd be very hard to get it to be par, but I don't,
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   I think that 99% of the population wouldn't notice.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   Now, got Nate singing a chatroom that the DisplayPort does support HDCP.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   So I'd like to find a link to, to call on the phone.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   Hey, I just, I just had someone ask me a question that I think we need to talk
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.400]   about what the hell's left for Macworld?
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   Ah, we got new iPods.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.400]   We got new Mac books.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.400]   You know, what are we going to do?
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.400]   We have a major i-work, i-life announcement.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:24.400]   I think we talk about Jason Calicanis's assertion that Apple is planning to release
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.400]   network, high definition televisions, basically Apple TV built in.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.400]   And that would be a very good thing indeed to announce it.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   Macworld Expo, wouldn't it?
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   It does.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   Yeah, I mean, it does certainly sound like they're clearing the deck so that
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.400]   they have all 90 minutes available for not only brand new stuff, but also,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.400]   you remember, remember when the iPhone came out, remember when the Apple TV came
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   out, all these brand new products, they didn't show, it wasn't just a 30 minute
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   demo.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   It had to be also the additional 30 to 45 minutes explaining why Apple was not
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   insane for making this product.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.400]   So really almost anything is possible for January now.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   Just briefly, I've got a Wikipedia article.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   Thank you, God, Nate, describing DisplayPort, which is in fact a standard, a Visa standard.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   I don't know if Apple's DisplayPort is the same as the Visa standard display port.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:25.400]   But DisplayPort is a license free, really free replacement for HDMI that actually is
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   bidirectional, so it allows you to send data.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   It's not compatible, of course, with DVI or HDMI, but those signals can be passed so
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   you could have a different, you know, you could be used in DVI mode, I guess.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.400]   It does support HDCP.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   I don't know if this is the DisplayPort that is in the Apple.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:56.400]   It's actually a very good standard as far as Display InterconnexCo.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.400]   I've had some video cards and one of the Dell 30 inches I have here supports it and it
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.400]   works very well.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.400]   It is license free.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:08.400]   It gets rid of a lot of the headaches that HDMI and HDCP kind of created.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.400]   Good.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   I would say if they're using the DisplayPort and it's got the same capitalization as I'm
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.400]   used to seeing it, that it is the same standard.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   They probably couldn't call it that if they not.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   Wikipedia says it is the DisplayPort in the new Cinema Display as well as the MacBook Pro.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   But of course, you know, anything can happen on Wikipedia.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.400]   Wikipedia has already been updated?
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   Let me see.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   It's from Engadget.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.400]   They're quoting Engadget.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   Yeah, I'm looking at the tech specs page.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.400]   The store is down, but the rest of the Apple sites up and it's saying DisplayPort and it
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   looks like the standard there.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.400]   Steve says, "Hdmi is limited in resolution.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.400]   DisplayPort is the connector of the future."
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   And I think having a two-way port is if you want to have a touchscreen display, for instance.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.400]   Well, didn't he say the Firewire was the port of the future?
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.400]   Well, yeah, no.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   The future is a moving target, isn't it?
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.200]   I don't think they're backing off on Firewire.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:12.280]   If they have Firewire 800 ports on the MacBook Pro, I think that's actually a good thing,
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.280]   isn't it?
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   Why would you have both?
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   You just get it from cable.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   I don't use it for 100 anymore.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.280]   I mean, I'm just using it.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.800]   Yeah, but they don't have any Firewire on the MacBook.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.880]   Well, they have to do something to distinguish the two.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.880]   They don't have any Firewire on the air.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.880]   Right.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.120]   The air never did, though.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.360]   It's a one USB port.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:37.640]   I know, and I think the one bummer about that is probably many bumbers.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:42.840]   But one of them is that USB takes a lot more CPU power than a Firewire.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.680]   And so you end up really dragging.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.760]   If you're driving a lot of big files around back and forth, it really is a pain in the
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:54.200]   neck to do it via USB, not just because it's slower, but because it actually drags the
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.920]   computer down while it's doing it.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.920]   Right.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.560]   No, I think Firewire is the way to go, obviously.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.600]   But I mean, if it's the thing of the future, how come two of the more recent computers
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.080]   announced by Apple don't have it?
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.760]   I think it's because that MacBook is awfully compelling as is, and they better take some
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.080]   stuff out or they're not going to have a differentiator between that and the pro.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.040]   I got just just that simple because the way we get a weight, then we get a weight on the
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.440]   MacBook of the basic MacBook.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.560]   It's a 4.5 pounds.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.240]   So that's a pound and a half heavier than the air.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.200]   And the one thing I didn't see the actual presentation.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   Is the battery removal?
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   There's nowhere on the specs.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   Oh boy.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   Oh boy.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.200]   That's a big gotcha.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.200]   Oh boy.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.240]   Because it talks about five hours of life, but I don't see any.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.200]   That would be a huge gotcha.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   Well, I don't.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   It would.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.200]   That's the way to me.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   It says something about battery compartment on the bottom.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   It does.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.000]   I think there wouldn't be a battery compartment.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.840]   Where does it say that?
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.560]   It said it on the store page that was up a minute ago.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:04.280]   You can't get in and buy one, but the page that was describing the computer said something
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   about.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.200]   You couldn't make a notebook without a removable battery.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.080]   Well, why don't you list it in the box and the box that says it lists it as well.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   You can.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.080]   It's called an air and air.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   But a netbooks don't usually.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.280]   But it does say it lists the lithium polymer battery as a separate thing in the box.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   Oh, OK.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.280]   There you go.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.400]   It's the way to access the drive and the battery from a door on the bottom says somebody crisis
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.400]   alerted.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.640]   No, no, no, no, whoever has a Wikipedia page open definitely mentioned that it doesn't
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   have a battery.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.640]   That's what Wikipedia is for.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.200]   It doesn't have a battery.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.240]   So I think in fact, people, it's interesting because this is the machined bot, but at the
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   machine bottom.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   So they have to machine.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.400]   No, no, no, machine, but this will be the machine.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.240]   But machine, but machine, but you notice the words Rick in any.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.680]   For some reason, they don't like that word.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.600]   It's not the technical term for what that is, though, is it?
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   It's something else.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.120]   It's like a ballast or something.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.200]   I can't remember the word for it.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.440]   So what do you think about $9.99 for the basic?
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.760]   At least they crack the $1,000 notebook price.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.280]   But not by much analysts were saying if they got down to 900 even that they would have
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   a 50% better sales, $9.99.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.280]   They've been there before.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.440]   This is not the first time they've had a $9.99 MacBook.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.600]   Yeah, but they're going backwards on price at a time when everybody else is going the
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.600]   other way, aren't they?
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.600]   No, everybody's going down.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.600]   Are they?
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   They're all right.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.960]   Ryan, you would know, but it looks to me like prices are going down across the board.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.600]   Yeah, they are.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.760]   Is anybody else disappointed?
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.280]   There was no like net book offering.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   I am.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   I really had hoped that.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.600]   And I know Merlin, the ghost of Merlin man is.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.680]   I want a 10 inch.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.240]   Really would have been a smart move.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.400]   Maybe that's what they'll announce at Mackerel, but it would have been such a.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.880]   Smart move to do a 10 inch.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.200]   They asked a Q and A about it and he said, the question was, are we going to see a net
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   book?
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.000]   And Steve apparently said in terms of net books, that's a nascent market that's just
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   getting started.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.440]   Oh, Kydokey, that's a that's a no answers with that.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.440]   So there you go.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.920]   That's when they're Christian broadcasters in the room.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.800]   He definitely that's a hell no.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   Hell, hell no.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.440]   You think that's a hell no or a we were keeping an eye on it.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.640]   Maybe we will.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:21.720]   I don't I'm not sure if Steve sees a future in which he can sell a $750 Mac book that
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.840]   doesn't somehow seem more awesome than the existing Mac book.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.880]   He likes to be more awesome, not less awesome.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.320]   Well, the other thing is you have to from a business point of view, there is a business
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.000]   case for saying, yeah, we're going to be a little bit more expensive forever.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.760]   Yeah, I mean, they're having no.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.760]   I mean, they're having no problem selling.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.240]   They're selling the Mac books to people going to college and they're having no problems
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.960]   doing that.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.240]   If they're having if they really wanted to, did they mention how well they're doing in
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.760]   like pre college education?
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:52.480]   Because that's where that's the people who buy like $600 notebooks by the bushel load.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.080]   Keep in mind, ASUS did sell 700 million EPCs last quarter.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.360]   Yeah, it's not it's not such a nascent market as all that.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.640]   And every single manufacturer is rushing to the market with them.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.320]   The interesting thing is it's nascent in the sense that it's changing rapidly.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:14.400]   If you look at Lenovo's S 101 compared to the original EPC, there's a, you know, the
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.440]   what the market expects is changing very quickly.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:23.240]   I mean, an EPC running VNC to back to my Mac is pretty, excuse me, to screen sharing is
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.440]   pretty damn hot.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:31.840]   I mean, I've gotten that look at a coffee shop by running this dinky little like $500 Windows
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.960]   machine that's clearly running the Mac OS at a pretty decent clip.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.440]   And I mean, it's a lot of people, if a lot of people would find room in their hearts
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.640]   for a really dirt cheap sub notebook.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.480]   I mean, I'm going, I'm going to be taking a train to New York in a couple of days.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.680]   And already I'm looking at the menagerie and thinking, yeah, but I do.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.360]   I want to take something as big as a Mac book.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.360]   Right.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.360]   Even though it's tri, it's trivially small.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.920]   This is not going to be a high computing weekend.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.080]   And if I can get away with, you know, if I could get away with a Bluetooth keyboard on
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   my iPhone, VNC back to my iMac, I would consider it for this trip.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.600]   Jackie Chang is writing an R's technique because she's obviously gone up to the room.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.600]   This is where I would be.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   I should say I had planned to be at the event today, but they formed me that I wouldn't
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.520]   be able to stream live from it.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.440]   So there didn't seem to be much point.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.280]   However, there is a point that I missed, which is I could have tried that trackpad and
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.480]   reported back to you.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.960]   Fortunately, Jackie has at R's technique as infinite loop column.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.120]   She says, let me say first, if you've already, you know, you're already used to Apple's
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.880]   track pads and your thumb knows where to click for the button, things aren't much different.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.840]   Good point, you could still click at that bottom edge.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.960]   She says the entire trackpad gives that pad gives tactile feedback when clicking.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.560]   So when you use your thumb to click anywhere in the bottom half of the trackpad, it clicks
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.240]   just like the button would.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.000]   In fact, the top part clicks too, but barely.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.600]   You'll never accidentally click it.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.280]   Now, this is an interesting contention while moving your fingers around the trackpad to
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.640]   navigate across your computer.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.840]   It's resistant enough not to click.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.280]   See, this is what I'm worried about while you're using it for tracking, but easy enough
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.200]   to click when deliberately clicking.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   It's a fine line.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:10.240]   Well, it sounds like the new nano, you know, when you want to skip songs, you really have
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.240]   to make an effort to make an effort.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:17.880]   Trackpad also knows when you're holding on to something, like a window or a folder.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.400]   This is that click drag.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.480]   For example, if you're dragging a file across the desktop with your pointer finger and your
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.360]   thumb is holding down the invisible button on the bottom, you can let go with your pointer
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.360]   finger and still be holding on to the file, move things around all you want, just like
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.200]   you would in a normal trackpad, it'll figure it out.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.240]   Okay, so that was one issue is how do I drag by holding the mouse down?
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.280]   It says the new trackpad feels identical, almost identical to the old trackpad.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.880]   She says an observation Phil Schiller takes huge issue with, "We're told he insists it's
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.640]   way smoother than the old trackpad."
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:54.760]   But she says going back and forth between my original MacBook Air and the new trackpad
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.480]   seems like no difference to me, however, and it certainly doesn't feel like glass.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.400]   Does glass make it more fragile?
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.680]   I don't know, but you'll certainly see a million memes going around that pretty soon.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.640]   It does make it more fragile, especially when you take the aluminum casing into consideration.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.400]   So thin, so you're going to get direct contact with the glass.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.600]   We're almost direct contact with the glass.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.080]   And that makes me nervous.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.000]   Well, I mean, look at the trackpad that's on a MacBook that's been used for like a year
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   or two.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.760]   I mean, it is polished to a mirror glossy finish online within like six or seven months.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:34.040]   Glass is probably a decision to make it more durable, easier to clean.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:38.400]   Also given the technology that they're using, it might be more sensitive to grease and grime
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:44.120]   than plain old plastic on the old style.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:49.040]   Glass reduces at display damage, therefore a lower Apple care cost.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:53.480]   Well, and also it's about the size of the iPhone.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.040]   It's about the size of the iPhone.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.840]   The trackpad is about the size of the iPhone.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.320]   That's pretty resilient.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.600]   I've dropped my iPhone a hundred times and it's still kicking.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.440]   Any other issues, things you want to talk about with regard to these announcements?
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.040]   I'm just looking through our chat room.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.760]   Did you see a blood pressure blood?
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.800]   Steve's blood pressure is 110 over 70.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   Like that makes any difference.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.280]   He could be dying, but he could have great blood pressure.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.280]   Exactly.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.280]   Oh, God, that new beta iPhone has a lot of sensors on it.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.040]   I thought that was a funny slide to put up.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.360]   Put that up there.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.840]   What did Steve say during that slide?
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.960]   He just said, "I'm still alive."
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   What does he say?
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.960]   I'm in good health?
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.400]   I think this is all we're going to say.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.800]   They could have put up his red blood cell count.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.160]   Well, that might have been more terrain, to be honest.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.680]   I don't know what the blood pressure is.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.320]   This is a triumph by making a note here.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   You could say this.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:53.240]   Yeah, or ask me another question about it and watch it go up.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.280]   Well, do they mean right then?
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.320]   I don't think they meant right then.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.760]   You know, when we do the show at Mackerel and we're live on stage, we each should each
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:13.520]   have a placard over us with some sort of medical trait like my cholesterol is 198.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.360]   He's still alive.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.360]   Still alive.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.680]   Well, in that regard, I thought it was interesting that they hauled out like Jonathan.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.600]   I was there and Tim Cook was there.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.600]   You never see Tim Cook, do you?
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.600]   You never see Tim Cook, do you?
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.640]   So what they're really saying is we have a deep bench.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:34.880]   We've got Schiller, we've got Cook, we've got Ive.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:40.480]   At Mackerel, Jobs is going to transform the stage into a basketball court and play a game
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:45.040]   of horse while talking about everything to show he's still vitally strong.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   That is just so weird, Nick.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.880]   Now that I think about it, I mean, that's just the weirdest thing.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.200]   Well, I wondered if that was part of the message, which is, no, come on, really.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.360]   We've got lots of people here and here they are and he did the same thing in the forest
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.640]   though during the iPhone stuff.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.960]   So maybe just to send out more people and put them on stage just to say, I'm not the
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:05.960]   only guy here.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.880]   You're going to hear that drumbeat from Apple from now on.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.000]   Look, they're publicly held company.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.200]   They got to get that stock price back up and you're going to hear that drumbeat nonstop.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.960]   But I don't think for a minute the stock price is where it is because everybody thinks
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   Steve's down in.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.960]   I have a question about that.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.080]   They have to get that stock price up.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.680]   Do they have to get the stock price up?
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.680]   Yes.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   Well, tell us why Scott.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.880]   Because they have a duty to their shareholders.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.280]   The shareholders have a right.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:34.520]   I mean, they buy shares because they want them to go up and the people who are executives
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.480]   at the company have a duty to try to make sure that that happens.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.200]   So they have to attend to the needs of their shareholders.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.680]   They're obligated by law.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.320]   I'll give you another reason.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.160]   You've got employees who are underwater on their stock options right now.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:53.160]   It makes it much more difficult to attract talent if your stock price is low.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.000]   Yeah, but the guys from just like five years ago were in there so in line.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   They're doing fine.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.480]   They're making it's resilience of dollars.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.480]   But it's hard.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   Again, it's hard.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.280]   I mean, it actually might be easier to attract people if they thought, hey, it's a hundred
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.440]   bucks now and it's going to go to 200.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.720]   This is a good time to join Apple.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.400]   I mean, Google has the same problem right now too.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.400]   Google does have a lot of people underwater.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.800]   Well, the civil law is, you know, that they have a duty to the shareholders.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.280]   So I mean, I would argue that you can satisfy that duty by simply making the very best products
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.840]   that you can, treating your customers right, making sure that sales go up and that you're
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.360]   fair and the way you run your company.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.480]   I think that satisfies that myself.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.120]   And I think that's what Apple tries to do and should do.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:40.720]   One of the slides they showed and Sunken Planet's pointing this out in the chat room showing
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:45.400]   Mac retail market share at 17.6%.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.280]   That is crazy.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.280]   Wow.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.520]   No, what qualifies them?
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:53.520]   Is that for a quality?
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.680]   You're going to qualify what the data is.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.640]   I don't know what it means.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.400]   This is a slide with it is bereft of any information.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:06.000]   Let me see if I can go back to the Engadget or somebody's transcript of this because it
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.160]   must be the most recent quarter.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.160]   I don't know.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.720]   All it says is since we're growing faster than the market and US retail market share, we've
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.120]   gone from single digits to 17.6%.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.360]   Single digits, they've got about 3%.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.480]   It's a huge jump.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.880]   In fact, we were talking a year ago about what it would be like if Apple got to 20% market
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:28.880]   share.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.160]   I think you Scott said, I don't want it to get that high.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:38.000]   Well, I'd be concerned if it gets that high that they've sort of lost their edge and they've
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   gone to mainstream.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.560]   One of the reasons I like to use Max is that there's just a certain thing about the way
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:50.440]   that Mac product has made that it sticks out.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.680]   I am glad to see more uptake and certainly in the way of laptops.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:58.400]   If you look at the numbers when you break them down to laptops, they're killing in laptops.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:04.760]   This probably has a lot to do with, they've rolled out Apple in all the best buys across
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.000]   the country now.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.120]   The only thing they specifically mention is US retail market share.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:17.520]   If they're restricting it to retail, that might be a little bit of an inflated number
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.040]   if you account online sales and that kind of stuff.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.200]   I remember the 3% days.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.440]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.520]   Now of course, 3% was of the total market and I'm sure they're not much higher than that.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.360]   The total market, I thought the number was getting 7, 8, 9.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.360]   I don't know.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.960]   You'd have to have 17%.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.240]   They're not much sales for many, many quarters to get to that point.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.240]   Because I mean...
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.480]   Yeah, I think most of the time those percentages are calculated on what sold that quarter as
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.840]   opposed to what people...
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.720]   What's still sitting out there?
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:56.480]   Retail stores are reporting 400,000 visitors a day, 50% of the Macs they sell are to new
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.480]   people.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:01.600]   That's one of the reasons you're getting this big shift in market share.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:07.400]   They qualified the number by saying that 7% is the share of fully functional systems.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.560]   So they're not including CP...
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.120]   They're total systems with monitor, mouse and everything.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.520]   I don't know if there are a lot of PC sales that don't include that.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.520]   So...
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.400]   There's some fudge in there for sure.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:25.360]   And Gadget is saying now and it's a first look at the new MacBook.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.840]   It's pretty clear this is the best MacBook and the best mainstream consumer laptop Apple
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.040]   has made to date.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:35.120]   They say very solid and it would be because of that manufacturing process you'd get a
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.560]   really solid feel of that thing.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   I'm talking about not about the Pro but the MacBook.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:52.960]   Well, like he said, the first question that Steve Rubell sent me was did Leo buy a MacBook
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.960]   last week?
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.960]   No.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.600]   I was waiting.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:01.080]   And I knew that we were... in fact, I wanted to get an air some months ago and I thought
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.080]   well, I'm waiting.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:06.880]   In fact, I was hoping that they would announce that at the last announcement in September
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.880]   and they didn't.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.160]   So I'm just been waiting.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.400]   But I have to say, the airs won't be out to November.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:18.200]   I think I'm probably going to get a MacBook or a MacBook Pro instead of an air.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:23.120]   Well, I love my air for the airplane and that's what I use it for.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.000]   It's just not a beefy enough to do serious computing.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.120]   That's what I'm going to use this MacBook for.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:36.880]   You saw Microsoft yesterday talking about the new MacBooks in a press release and their
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.040]   new phrase is Apple Tax.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:45.400]   The Apple Tax that in fact, they say it eight times in the email they sent out to press an
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.560]   analyst, the Apple Tax.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:55.840]   If you pay more for... even if Apple were to drop pricing, the Apple Tax still prices
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.480]   max well outside of the sub-thousand dollar range.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.280]   It's very interesting.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:06.320]   For one thing, it shows Microsoft's starting to feel the pain a little bit because they
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.640]   actually are directly attacking Apple.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.200]   They haven't done that yet before.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.840]   This is a new, a new tax for them.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.800]   You can upgrade just about any Windows desktop PC, but the only significantly upgradable
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:22.440]   Mac is the Mac Pro listed at $27.99.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.080]   Repurchasing software to make your Mac do all the things your PC does will cost you hundreds
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   of dollars.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.080]   What?
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.480]   This is from the email.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:32.760]   I did have that problem.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:37.240]   I tried when I went to Mac, if I rebuy your Adobe software, you're all...
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.720]   Oh, I see what you mean.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.720]   Yeah, well, that's true.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.920]   In fact, when people ask me...
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.920]   That's quite an expense.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.480]   Yeah, well, because I got switching, I point that out.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:49.400]   And likewise, if you were to switch to Windows, from Mac, you'd have that same cost.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.800]   That's just makes sense.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.600]   But I mean, he doesn't mention the fact that you have to spend hundreds of dollars to prevent
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.560]   the spyware and viruses from consuming your every moment.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.400]   That's a good point.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.240]   Or that you have to have some sort of technician available to help you make this to work.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.560]   I really think what's more to the point that Microsoft even is daining to mention Apple.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:12.120]   That is really important, true, because you never mention your direct competitors if you're
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.720]   kicking their butts because they're like a nat on you, you know what.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.400]   So I think that it does show that they're concerned.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.800]   It really is quite funny that they've responded in kind, even with the commercials, which of
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:28.320]   course in typical Microsoft fashion kind of suck.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.600]   Everything they're doing, see like the zoom is a response to the iPod.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:36.160]   And it really sort of starts to look petty to me.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.680]   I don't think it's so much petty, so much as they are...
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:45.320]   The analogy I always come up with is that Apple is like a sniper who lies in weight covered
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:52.280]   in foliage from 1500 yards away, waits until the ambassador is right in the line of sights,
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:58.680]   pulls a trigger, his head explodes from absolutely nowhere and gets it the first shot first time.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:04.320]   Microsoft is more like Tony Montana just grabbing that machine gun and spraying the room,
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.320]   walking, looking where the bullet holes hit the plaster and just keeping walking its
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.600]   fire until it eventually hits its target.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.960]   So the first version of something is going to kind of suck.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.680]   The second version is going to be a little better.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.920]   The third version will be useful but still not quite there.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.680]   The fourth and the fifth version because after they keep releasing things and making
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.720]   little tweaks and paying attention to what's working, what's not working.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:31.040]   I mean, Windows Media Center, the first version that they put out was just absolutely horrible,
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.920]   but eventually it became a really great set of features for acquiring media and using your
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:39.400]   Windows machine as a DVR.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:45.360]   And this is the third generation of Zoom hardware and for the first time I can actually say it
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.360]   doesn't suck.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:54.320]   It is as good, it is a perfectly non-mockable alternative to an iPod if you've decided
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.920]   for some reason that an iPod is not the thing you want.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:00.480]   So if they'd suddenly decided that, okay, we have the infrastructure for having a music
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.640]   player and having a music store, now instead of just locking it to once at a hardware,
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.800]   let's license this out or let's put this on phones, not come up with a Zoom phone but
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.480]   simply come up with a Zoom app that you can install on any phone.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.000]   That's sort of an interesting tweak.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   I certainly wouldn't have expected Vista to be really great out of the gate.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.600]   I certainly didn't expect it to tank as bad as it did, but you start to look for revision
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.800]   two, revision three, revision four, because that's just the way they operate.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:33.920]   Yeah, I'm looking at pictures now on Infinite Loop at ours, Technica of the battery removal
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:34.920]   process.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.880]   The panel now goes all the way across the bottom of the MacBook.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:45.240]   It is a latch now, no longer do you have to turn the knob with a coin.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.560]   Latch looks very easy to use.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:50.440]   Latch is locked by the Kensington lock, by the way, so they can't steal your battery.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:56.400]   Maybe more to the point that once you remove that panel, the hard drive very easily accessed.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.840]   Somebody could just come and get your hard drive easily if they didn't lock that down.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.800]   Did they say anything about how accessible the memory module was so you didn't have to
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.480]   pay twice as much for an upgrade from two to four gigs?
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:11.400]   To replace the memory in the unit, you do not have to remove the hard drive or the battery.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:16.320]   Replacing the memory requires you to remove four screws immediately above the battery,
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.640]   and it sounds like a fairly easy process.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.760]   That's been the case with all the MacBooks and MacBook Pros for a while now.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.000]   It's been pretty easy to put memory in.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.600]   It sounds like it's even easier.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.480]   Certainly, the easiest ever to replace the hard drive.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:33.120]   In fact, I guess my recommendation at this point would be buy it with the cheapest hard
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.800]   drive that comes with if you want a bigger hard drive because it's going to be a snap
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   to put in a new one.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.600]   And buying them third party, like RAM, like anything else without.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   I don't usually buy RAM or hard drives from Apple.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.000]   You're usually going to pay a premium for that.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.560]   You can generally find them either online or even some brick and mortar are going to
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.360]   be less expensive.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.800]   I tried to change the hard drive on my 15-inch.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.760]   Yeah, I ended up with another 15-inch.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.520]   Yeah, this is a much, much easier process.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:09.000]   What are SSD prices, Ryan, right now for hard drive?
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.560]   Depends on how fast you want to get.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:16.960]   The 500 bucks, which is the Apple premium for 128, doesn't sound like that much.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.960]   It's not.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.760]   My guess is that's not going to be one of the top speed.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.760]   Okay.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.920]   The SLC type 1 is a single level.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.680]   The single level cell traditionally are like the ones that are really, really fast.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:35.640]   MLC is a little bit slower but cheaper, but that varies a lot as well.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:43.800]   We've seen Intel's MLCs outperform off-brand MLCs by 100% in read/write tests.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:49.320]   What brand names do you like for SLC or MLC drives?
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:54.960]   I tell you, if you could find the Intel drives that were announced three weeks ago at IDF
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:57:00.640]   or more than that, I guess now a month ago, those would be the ones I'd recommend.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.680]   Supertalent, which is a name probably not many people have heard of, but they make some
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:06.080]   really good drives as well.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:13.480]   OCC does as well, but OCC is really just a re-labeler of Samsung drives.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:22.040]   So I'm looking at Newegg and they have Rydata OCC, supertalent, a supertalent 64 gig, presumably
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.840]   that would be the SLC memory, right?
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:26.840]   $239.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:30.360]   So I think probably if you want a solid-state drive, the smart thing to do would be to buy
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:34.640]   it with the cheapest hard drive that Apple offers and do the upgrade.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.440]   Yeah, I would say so.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.600]   Now, what do you think about it coming with 4 gigabytes of RAM for the Mac?
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.840]   That's great news, isn't it?
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:44.800]   Yeah, because normally I have to pay the upgrade price, which as you guys always point out,
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.280]   is very high.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.240]   And now they just sort of say, eh, would you throw it in?
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.800]   Yeah, I think that's the way it should be.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.600]   4 gigs is kind of should be standard at this point.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.680]   Yeah, high-end machines.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:01.840]   4 gigs is really becoming standard, especially when you see how the prices of memory have
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.840]   fallen, like rocks.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   Even DDR3.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.240]   Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:16.920]   Not as much as DDR2, but DDR3 has come way down in the last eight months or so to be reasonable
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.920]   again.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.440]   What benefit is there to the DDR3?
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.520]   DDR3 just gives you more bandwidth.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:30.520]   You can run at speeds of up to 1,600 megahertz, whereas DDR2 kind of stops at 1066.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.080]   Did they say what speeds the memory was running on the MacBooks?
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.080]   Let me check.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.640]   That's a good question.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.120]   I want to say it couldn't be that slow.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.680]   But of course it is a laptop.
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.680]   I want to say 1066.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:48.000]   I wanted to say 1066, but that's awfully slow.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.800]   That's pretty fast for a slow-dip memory for notebook memory.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.520]   Okay, so notebook DDR3 is still SO.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.520]   Okay.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.280]   And so those are not as fast.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:05.920]   Yeah, traditionally notebook memory is always going to be a step or two below desktop memory,
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.080]   just because it's not usually just because it's less expensive and it's just not as
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:15.440]   necessary because the rest of the components in the notebook system are a little bit slower.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.440]   Right.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.440]   Right.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.440]   Right.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:25.400]   So it doesn't seem like there's much benefit to using DDR3 at that slower bus speed.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.200]   I would tend to agree with you there.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:32.640]   In being that the chipset supports both, I'm actually...
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   Kind of surprising.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.720]   A little surprise that they would choose that.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:41.600]   Maybe it's just they're trying to future-proof themselves again for when DDR2 eventually
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.800]   slows down and becomes not available.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:44.800]   But...
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:48.120]   DDR3 is the future of RAM.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.120]   It is.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:54.080]   I mean, everything will move to it eventually, Intel's new processors that will be out later
[00:59:54.080 --> 01:00:00.760]   this year have an integrated DDR3 memory controller and pretty much once Intel makes that move,
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.240]   they kind of lead the market.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.480]   So wherever they go is where everybody else will go.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.120]   And so you'll see DDR3 production really ramp up.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:16.440]   DDR3 is a super-talent, 120 gig internal solid-state disk.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.000]   And these form factors are standard, right?
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.720]   So if it should work in a MacBook, I presume.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:27.960]   I would assume so if they use a standard two and a half inch hard drive form factor.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960]   Right.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.640]   Sequential access, 120 megabyte, read 80 megabyte, write.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   Is that...
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.400]   Can you tell whether it's SLC from that?
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.040]   That sounds like MLC.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.480]   That's a little slower.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.320]   SLC, yeah.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.760]   It's still going to be faster than your traditional spindle-based drives.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.760]   But that's...
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.120]   Here's a 64 gig for 239 that has 150 megabyte read and 100 megabyte write.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.120]   That's probably the...
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.440]   Yeah, that's the MLC, NAND flash.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.960]   So we're looking for SLC.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:58.960]   Interesting.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.600]   Those are a little bit harder to come by because they are more expensive.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.760]   Yeah, new way to do it.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.520]   Intel, like I said, Intel is probably going to make the best drive for the next...
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.680]   For at least for the rest of the year.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.680]   But you haven't been able to find it recently.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.680]   Right.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.400]   Since it's been released, I haven't seen it for sale anywhere yet.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.360]   Would you think it will see a day when you get to have both on board one computer?
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:27.680]   They can figure out a way to do a standard hard disk drive and maybe a backup SD drive?
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.680]   I don't know if...
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.320]   I think before you'll have two drives, you'll have hybrid drives.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.960]   Maybe a spindle-based drive that will have 200 gigs and then a 100 gig or 50 gig of solid
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   state.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.960]   That's interesting.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.480]   Something like that could happen.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.680]   Other than that, I think eventually we'll see solid state eventually kind of take over.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.080]   Oh, I'm sure you're right.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.080]   I'm sure you're right.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.680]   I do think that would be sooner rather than later.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.320]   I was actually kind of hoping for a hybrid or whatever you suggested this time.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.520]   But I knew that I was probably hoping for too much.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.560]   But I still have five and a quarter inch floppies I'm looking to work with.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.720]   Yeah, I'm looking now.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:10.880]   I found a super talent SLC drive, 170 megabyte read, 130 megabyte write, but 64 gigs, 825
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.880]   bucks.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.880]   Wow.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.320]   So you pay if you want that price, you really do.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.320]   Yep.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.320]   All right.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   But you know what?
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.320]   This just means you can upgrade.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   It's future proof.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.400]   Buy it with a hard drive now and in a year when SLC SSDs are cheap, you can upgrade.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.400]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.040]   And think of that easy upgrade.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:38.680]   The video now that they showed on the manufacturer process is now available on the Apple site.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.320]   That was kind of unusual.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.640]   Chris, do you ever remember them showing that much detail on how they make something?
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.640]   No, not really.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.000]   And it was kind of surprising.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.160]   I don't know if they were just trying to bulk up the presentation or just say this is so
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.160]   cool.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.160]   I did.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.360]   I this is the kind of thing that wouldn't happen anywhere else only only at a company
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.440]   like Apple where Steve Jobs could say, I don't care if it costs 20 times more.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.520]   We're doing it.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.480]   We're going to build the plan or whatever it is because it clearly it's going to cost
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.320]   more to make it this way.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:12.440]   Did they say if it was if it was the rumors are true about it being built in the US?
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.080]   Ah, that's a good question.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.080]   I didn't see the video.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.320]   You want to watch?
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.560]   You can watch it.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.400]   See what they say.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.560]   I don't know if they had to.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.280]   Here comes the Mac book.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.600]   Jonathan is our most popular Mac.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:34.280]   But what we've done and we've made a habit of doing this at Apple is.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.080]   It seems to lead us on a guided visualization of something.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.480]   You're now getting sleepy.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480]   Star toasts.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.240]   You feel good.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.720]   This is the Mac book, which is interesting.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.960]   They didn't restrict this process to the Mac book pro.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.040]   They actually they also did it with the Mac book.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.480]   The new Mac book is a quite remarkable engineering achievement.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.480]   Right, right, right, right.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.480]   I'm going to go, I'm going to go, I'm going to go, I'm going to go.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.920]   Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like, you know, you got to.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.360]   It's so tempting to try to pick apart everything in this presentation.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:07.160]   And when I see something that was that deliberate and put that much thought went into this part
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.560]   of the presentation, I have to think that they're trying to get out a piece of information
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.600]   to make analysts and to make basically everybody very, very comfortable with the sort of company
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.680]   that Apple is said, no, we don't, we don't just OAM these things out.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.600]   We just don't, we don't just be got Sony.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.400]   We have built a massive infrastructure so that whatever it is we want to build, we can control
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.120]   it from end to end.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.880]   And you know, I think there is a different field of these machines.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.200]   They're much more solid because here's the plan.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.720]   Finish them perspective.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.520]   We take giant slabs of aluminum.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.400]   The beginning of the unit body starts with the solid block of a moment and we go through
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:47.000]   an extrusion process, just kind of like how you make like pasta and the output is that.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.840]   It's like a giant pasta machine.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.920]   No, it's like it's like those one of our other cartoons where they jump in those giant logs
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.280]   and giant animated axes woken down to one toothpick.
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:02.480]   Thirteen separate milling operations to take apart from solid block down to the finished
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.840]   finely detailed part that has all the features that we need to go off and assemble the new
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.840]   MacBook.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.640]   Look at it grinding away at that thing.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.640]   Man.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.640]   I love the power Paul senior.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.160]   He starts yelling at Jonathan for not working enough.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.160]   Come on.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.600]   That case was supposed to be out of this shop tomorrow.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   Simple enough.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:25.520]   So we can get it right every single time.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:32.120]   So that enables a level of precision that is just completely unheard of in this industry.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.440]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   They're selling this.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.000]   There's a cell job here of some kind.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   Is it do they we all think it's really that important how the cases are made?
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.800]   If it's an innovative process, is anybody else doing anything like this, Ryan?
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.520]   Not that I know of or if they are, they're not making as big a deal about it.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.760]   They're not making movies about it.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   I just don't know.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.840]   It just seems like one of those things that you know, maybe they thought the event was
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.960]   a little bit less exciting with their announcement.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.680]   So they needed to kind of push something else into it.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.680]   I don't know.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.560]   That's a flash to it.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.720]   Say again.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:09.960]   I mean, that might be true as well.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.000]   Like I'm saying, it's easy to read into everything.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.440]   But you know, this is a company that they do very little by accident.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.480]   It looks, you know, it looks cool.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.680]   I think we have a startup, but I can see them using this kind of process for everything.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.240]   You know, yeah, this would just be the real beginning of the process.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.040]   You know, I mean, they're just experimenting with this now.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.040]   Right.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.520]   And I think that a lot of people who buy it, I mean, you generally know that your Mac is
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:40.000]   going to be is going to feel a little bit more solid than most of the other computers
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   that you might buy.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.960]   But this process is unique to them.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   Right.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.000]   I mean, it's not like they invented this process.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.400]   No, no, not at all.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.320]   No, but I think that the thing is that a company that outsources another company that
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.880]   you know, has a whole bunch of different vendors sending them stuff from all these things that
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   they're in their assembling.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:03.560]   And I think what they're distinguishing from is like the Dell that has a huge pipeline and
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.320]   all this stuff is coming in from all over the world.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.680]   And they put the, you know, it all ends up in a computer and it's pretty, it's a, it's
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.320]   a feat to do that.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:16.400]   But it's different than, you know, we control every little bit of, you know, of how this
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400]   thing is made.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.080]   And there's a certain, I think what they're selling, I think, is a craftsmanship that you're
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.160]   just not going to see when you're, you know, clumping a whole bunch of stuff together from
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.400]   a bunch of different vendors.
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:31.960]   I guess also people are going to have a little bit, well, difficult time choosing Macbook
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960]   or MacBook Pro.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:37.960]   In other words, I don't think the Mac book, because is any longer kind of the low end
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.400]   Mac, it's, you choose it because it's got a smaller screen.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400]   I think it's a screen.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.320]   You know, my, I know my wife, you know, should have, I mean, in all for what she uses it
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.000]   for the Mac book would have been what she wanted, except that she needed a larger screen.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.240]   You know, that was the one thing that just had her put go up to a Mac book pro once
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.240]   you just once you bought one recently.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.560]   There's much, there's much less difference between them than there was.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.920]   They're now both made out of that, you know, aluminum billet.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:07.760]   They, they have the same kind of screen, different sizes, processor speeds is just not that much
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.760]   to distinguish them.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.880]   Jobs was really trying to make that point too and saying, you know, last week, if you
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.920]   wanted this kind of capability, you'd have to get a Macbook pro.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.920]   Right.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.360]   And now look, you know, we've, we've saved you 800 bucks.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.040]   Maybe this is their answer to the net book.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.920]   The saying, well, we don't make a net book, but we make a Mac book, which is, you know,
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.600]   smaller, four and a half pounds is not that big, less than an inch thick.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.600]   I'm not sure.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:37.280]   I wanted to remind everybody that bought a computer last week that they got screwed.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.280]   Apple's pretty good.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.680]   If you bought at the Apple store, if you could bring it back, they're pretty good about that,
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:41.680]   I think.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.680]   Same.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.680]   Hey, I want the new one.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.440]   The, the, I think that there's enough.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:50.400]   They're just the little things that, that for the people who need a Macbook pro, you know,
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:56.040]   the Firewire 800, the 512 meg V Ram, the, you know, there's just little things that they,
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:00.560]   that they put into that, the slightly larger screen that will keep the pro people's continuing
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560]   to buy the pro one.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.560]   Right.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.520]   But really then gives plenty of value to the folks that are doing the Mac, the Macbook.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:11.720]   I can tell you that's, I mean, the very reason I pulled the trigger, I have not purchased
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.760]   a lot of upgrades, which is unlike me.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.880]   I usually just get every new thing that they make, but I, I held off using these old Macbook
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:22.560]   pros because I was waiting for something really significant so that I can take aperture on
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:27.000]   the road and really see some performance, you know, update and boy, this looks like a
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.600]   nice aperture machine to me.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.600]   Sure does.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.600]   Sure.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.120]   I definitely think with between aperture and I think new, the new CS four is just, it really
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.120]   sits a lot more on the GPU.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   Absolutely.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.960]   And so I think CS four will definitely take advantage of this with the new content, we're
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.320]   scaling and, and much faster scrolling.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.760]   So yeah, this, this is a machine that photographers who do, you know, serious road work can use
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:55.160]   on, in the field, plus the ability to just took it right up to a 24 inch cinemas play
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.520]   that's under a thousand bucks and turn that thing around and show it to your client or
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520]   whatever.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.240]   That's, that's a pretty sweet combo right there.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.960]   Do you think that the lack of a 17 inch display at the high end is going to change how professional
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.760]   photographers and professional video folks see it as a, as a mobile production machine?
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.720]   Cause every time I've seen who opt for the big, big display, there are always people who
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.840]   are just, look, I'm here in the back of the car.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840]   I'm editing this video.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.520]   I want to have something done tonight before I get back to the hotel.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520]   It's done.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   It's done.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.520]   It's done.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.520]   Why do that now?
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.520]   And on the current one, I do it all the time.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.800]   I mean, I don't, I mean, I was rendering, you know, open, or I was rendering a global illumination
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.800]   rendered stuff last night for a project on my laptop.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.720]   And so it's already there, I think.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.520]   I mean, I don't think about getting the 17 inches.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.600]   It isn't really to me a road machine, a 17 inches.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.200]   But I want to have my desktop that I'm going to move from home to work.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.720]   I don't carry that 17 anywhere.
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.720]   I just leave it sitting, right?
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.640]   In fact, your guys are all on it on Skype.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   It's running Vista.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.720]   I should say that, but I just too big.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.720]   It's too big.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:56.280]   For those of us that are, for those of us that are horizontally challenged, even in first
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:01.000]   class, you can't use the 17 and get the thing open, the seat in front of you is in your
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   way.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.700]   So I mean, it's so big.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.920]   It's been a long time since I've owned a 15 to be honest with you.
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:08.920]   Really?
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.280]   I really like that.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.560]   I like Louisville.
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.600]   I think the 15 is absolutely the sweet spot of display size.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.600]   Yeah, it is.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:20.280]   It's big enough to have a big working document area plus enough space for tool palettes and
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.280]   stuff like that.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:27.640]   Well, once again, for 900 bucks, you can turn it into a 15 and a 24.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   True.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.600]   And you can split up your palettes on the small monitor or use the big monitor for image work.
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.440]   I mean, I really, I'm starting to see the billions of them.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.640]   In fact, can I make this my pick of the week?
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:44.160]   Yeah, we're going to get the week is the MacBook Pro and the 24 inch cinemas.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:51.320]   We're going to get to that in just a bit.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.000]   Actually, your picks of the week and Ryan, you can recuse yourself if you choose.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.080]   I was going to say I was not, I was not prepared for this unless you want to pick a Windows
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.080]   laptop or something.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.080]   Why don't you pick your favorite net book?
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.760]   All right, I'll do that.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.880]   But before we do that, I do want to mention our audible pick of the week.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.080]   And it's a kind of a special pick this week.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.400]   I hope I'm allowed to say this.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.040]   I'm trying to figure this out.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.280]   You're only placed in the 12th through the 19th.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.480]   All right, I'm going to say it.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.640]   I'm going to say it.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:21.160]   We have a special book from audible.com.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.640]   Audible did an exclusive called metatropolis.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.640]   It's a very interesting idea.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.440]   I've been listening to it and it is really cool.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.200]   If you like speculative fiction, sci-fi, if you will, what they did is they got five
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:40.080]   of the best sci-fi authors out there to collaborate on what the world might look like in the near
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.080]   future.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.760]   And they created this idea of metatropolis.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.560]   And then each of them wrote a novella in that world.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:55.440]   So there's separate stories, in fact, in separate cities, but in the same kind of universe.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.120]   And it's coming out really great.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.120]   The readers are pulled from battle star galactic us.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.800]   So one is Michael Hogan, Colonel Saul Tagg.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.160]   Another is D. Duala, Candice McClure.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:13.800]   So they also have Lieutenant Felix Geeta, Alessandro Giuliani, Giuliani.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.560]   So they have a number of battle star galactic people reading these incredible stories.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.520]   I'm in the middle of the first one, Jay Lakes in the forest of the night.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.440]   Now I want to tell you how you can get it for free.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.760]   It's a way audible has decided to make this free for everyone worldwide.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.920]   You don't have to join audible to do it.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.960]   And it is an exclusive.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.880]   This is this is the only place you can get this chapter.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:47.440]   So I want you to go to audible.com/twit-meta audible.com/twit-t-w-i-t-m-e-t-a.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.240]   Now you know I talk about audible all the time.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.640]   Andy and I are big audible fans.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.480]   Alex and Scott somewhat less so they can.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.400]   I still I get audible books all the time.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   Oh, I you do.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.400]   Okay.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400]   I don't know.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.400]   Yeah, me too.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.400]   But I'm still stuck on.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.400]   I probably go.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.400]   Sorry.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.240]   Yeah, I'm still stuck on this part.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.800]   I actually just got a new book yesterday.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:07.800]   What do you listen to?
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:08.800]   Ghost.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.800]   I read shadow divers.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.440]   I'm sorry shadow divers.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.680]   So shadow diver just just just down that I haven't started listening to it yet.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.480]   But that was that's my I bought that last night.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.400]   If I could pick one like audible book to introduce everybody to audible, it would be that it's
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.400]   an amazing book.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.560]   Boy, I mean it's funny.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:30.720]   I had a friend I was I was at my class reunion over the weekend and a friend of mine he just
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.200]   was just going off on how great the book was.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.960]   And while he's talking, I'm sitting there on my iPhone going to audible.com to see if
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.120]   it really existed because you know, if it's not an audible, it doesn't really exist.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.800]   So metatropolis, the book is not available till October 21st.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:49.760]   We have exclusive rights to tell you how to get the free first story.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.320]   You do not have to be an audible member.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.320]   You don't even have to join audible.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.880]   It's a way to listen to this.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.160]   Get a sense of these are these.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.000]   This is one of these audible frontiers productions where they're doing because the sci-fi books
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.080]   tend not to be produced as audio books.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.320]   They're doing it themselves and there's some great stuff on there.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:07.080]   But metatropolis, I'm so glad they commissioned this.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:12.280]   And this first one, Jay Lakes in the forest of the night is incredible.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.320]   I'm just digging it.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:19.760]   So take a listen, absolutely free audible.com/twitmeta.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.960]   And you know, check out other audible book shadow divers and other great choice.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.000]   In fact, if you go to audible.com/macbreak, you can sign up for audible and get a free
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   book.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.240]   So you get the twit, metateal, the free metropolis and then also get shadow divers, if
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   you like.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.720]   Alec Lindsey's pick of the week.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:42.920]   Really good book about deep sea diving, German, a hitherto unknown German YouTube boat.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.240]   It's true story.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.440]   You boat, not a YouTube boat.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440]   A you boat.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.400]   You choose a band.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.400]   It was amazing.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.200]   It could have been a you boat.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.040]   It was a you boat, in fact.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.920]   And nobody knew he even went down.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.080]   It's a really amazing story.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.640]   It's all true.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.640]   Shadow divers.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.440]   And don't forget audible.com/twitmeta for your free copy of metatropolis.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.760]   Really, I'm just digging it.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:14.080]   And we thank audible so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.960]   So what's your favorite net book right now, all right?
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:23.680]   I have to say my new favorite that I'm one I'm playing with now is one of the ASUS EPC
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.680]   1000 HA.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.680]   Really?
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.240]   Yeah, the 10 inch screen.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:34.360]   The Adam 1.6 gigahertz 160 gig standard hard drive, one gig memory on it comes with
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.880]   Windows XP.
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.240]   You could put, you know, depending on how savvy you are.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.600]   I've seen many people put Mac leopard on it with kelway and that kind of stuff as well
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.280]   as Linux and do triple boots on it.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:52.320]   And it's actually a very functional machine that you can get for 420 bucks.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.600]   This is this is without the Apple tax.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.480]   Yeah, and without the Apple OS.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:04.320]   So we can as an America, you can feel as though you're one of them London people coming over
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.720]   here to exploit the weak dollar.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.640]   That's what British people spend on them.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.160]   Annie Naco, you have a apple pick for us?
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:19.800]   Yes, I have a pick for our iPod loving friends and our iPhone loving friends.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:25.840]   This is a car mount that is so good that it really it really kind of moved me from.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:29.400]   Yeah, I should really buy an iPhone 3G like soon to, you know what?
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.720]   Let's go to the Apple store right now and go get one.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.040]   It is from different technology.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:37.680]   It's called the Windows seat and it has two really key features that almost every other
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:41.040]   car mount that comes my way has utterly failed at number one.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.160]   It does have a such suction cup mount cup mount like the rest.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.360]   However, unlike the rest, this suction cup mount actually sticks to the windshield, which
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.240]   I think is a key feature in a suction cup mount.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:56.760]   The, I mean, I can't tell you how many times I have phoned a friend and talked to them.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:01.200]   And the, and by the time they pick up the phone, I said, Oh, son of a bad, because in
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.200]   the middle of just by reaching out and touching the button to dial, the thing has dropped off
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.760]   the thing and the cord has wrapped around the steering wheel.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:10.000]   And now I'm basically contemplating either the water or the bridge or button and all
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.760]   because someone did not understand the concept of a suction cup should stick to something.
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:18.280]   But the other cool thing is that it's so flexible.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:26.800]   It's a ball joint with on an arm that has a really easily click and click out mount for
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.800]   your device.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.960]   It comes with three different cradles, one for the first generation iPhone and two for
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.160]   the iPhone 3G and the iPod touch.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.920]   But the cool thing is that it actually comes with an actual, a second section of arm that
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:48.200]   you can snap in so that no matter where you want this iPhone to hover on your dashboard,
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.960]   you can get it to basically be wherever you want it to be.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.680]   I had to put in the extension and I essentially have it hovering right near the driver's side
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680]   window.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:02.200]   It's on the same sort of eye level as my side view mirror.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.720]   And it just works really, really, really well.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.520]   It also has an adhesive mount so that if you want to just create a spot on your dash
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:15.400]   or on your side board where you can just basically make the suction cup stick nice and clean
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.400]   to it.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.600]   Make it stick right there.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.800]   And like I said, rock solid once you locked out, once you can noodle around with it wherever
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.960]   you and put it where you want it to go, once it's where you want it to go, you just tighten
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.120]   down the nuts on the ball joints.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:36.360]   And I've had in the car for about three weeks now and it just has not moved one inch since
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.360]   then.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   And it's affordable.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.360]   It's 29.99.
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:45.160]   And like I said, I hate all these different car mounts where it works, but it will bounce
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.240]   around as you're driving around or it works.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:52.480]   But you have to basically reassemble it every time you get in and out of the car or or or
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.280]   or this is the first one that it's cool.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.560]   It's almost as if I was able to pay some guy to actually do something productive inside
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.560]   my car.
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560]   Great.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560]   Cool.
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.560]   A great pick from Andy Inaka.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.560]   When where do we find that?
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.920]   I can go to griffandtechnology.com also available.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.200]   I'm certain at finer retailers everywhere.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.400]   Griffin always does such great stuff.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.000]   They're good.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.920]   Let's see Alex Lindsey, you got a pick for us?
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.080]   I have a pick.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.160]   So this is brand new on the Mac.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:27.560]   So it was on the Mac and then now it's back and it is it's program called ZBrush.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.520]   And it's kind of this.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.520]   Oh, I remember seeing ZBrush.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.160]   So ZBrush, you know, there was an earlier version that came out and then they took it
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:41.200]   off the Mac and I think they got a lot of friction about it because it was a, you know,
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.360]   it was an artist tool.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:48.160]   And what ZBrush allows you to do is actually you can actually paint in 3D.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:53.720]   So it's this very interesting kind of what we call a two and a half D painting tool.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.480]   And it is, it's really amazing.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:01.320]   It is a, what you basically can do is you can bring a model in or you can even just simply
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:07.000]   start with a sphere and then just start painting on it and literally sculpt it like clay.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.760]   I mean, when you have a Wacom tablet and a ZBrush, it is just you literally are just
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.000]   kind of sculpting stuff out.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.160]   And so you can put stuff together, you can make, you can ding things up, you can, but,
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:25.240]   but it is just regardless of whether you, you know, even if you are never going to buy
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:28.840]   it, it's worth going to download the demo and just try it.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:29.920]   It is so much fun.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:33.920]   Like when I just want to not think about anything and I just want to just have some fun and
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:34.920]   kind of stretch out.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.600]   I don't really play games on my computer, but if I just want to have a, have a just kind
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.720]   of relax, a lot of times I'll just open up ZBrush on a, on a flight and I used to have
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.760]   to go to my window side and open it up and I just sit there and just paint stuff, you
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:50.160]   know, just just draw stuff, you know, build like a head, like some kind of crazy head
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.040]   or build this little creature or build.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:57.000]   And if you go up to, you know, ZBrush.com and look at the gallery, you'll get a sense
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.320]   of what people can do with this.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.120]   And it is truly amazing.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.120]   It's a, it's an application that you can play with.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.280]   It is used in many, many facilities.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:09.760]   The stuff like, like, and I believe most of the stuff for like Gollum, for instance, like
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.200]   all his skin and all his little pieces and everything else were all painted in ZBrush.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.720]   They were modeled in something else and then at all those little fine details were painted
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.720]   in.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.040]   And so it's just a fantastic program.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:27.680]   And it's really, as I said, it's $595, so almost an Alex, you know, for it.
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.960]   So it's not particularly inexpensive, but there is a, there is a demo that you can download
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:39.080]   and it's, and just while that demo exists, you'll be able to have a lot of fun putting
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:40.080]   it together.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.720]   It's, it's just a fantastic app.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:44.960]   And I'm really, really glad that it has come back to OS 10.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.880]   So I don't have to go into boot camp every time I want to use it.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.880]   Very cool.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.040]   ZBrush.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.000]   And the website is zBrush.com.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.760]   Easy to remember.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:00.680]   I'm going to mention something that a guy sent to me on Twitter.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:01.760]   His name is underseen.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:07.040]   I don't use, I haven't been using spaces for a while because it was kind of funky and kind
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.040]   of weird.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.480]   It's gotten a little bit better.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.640]   And this, sorry about that Chris.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.120]   Are you okay now?
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.120]   You hate doc?
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.080]   Do you hate to do you hate to spaces?
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.080]   Yeah, that much.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.080]   I mean, over.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:30.400]   But, but, but especially on my Macbook spaces is very handy because it is a smaller screen
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.800]   than I do like to get more stuff on the screen.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.320]   But this little free download has made it absolutely very cool.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.640]   It's called Doc Spaces.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.080]   It's free.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.200]   And you can download it.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:46.600]   I actually got it from, from Apple, but it's by a guy named Patrick Hamelo.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.240]   And you can get it from his dot Mac.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:52.440]   It's web.mac.com/patricjamelo.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.760]   But if you just do a search for Doc Spaces on the Apple OS 10 downloads site, you'll find
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.760]   it.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:03.800]   What it does is it changes the doc, gives you up to five different docs, one for each space.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:07.720]   So when you go to a new space in spaces, your doc changes also.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:13.240]   It also adds a recent stack, recent application stack, which is very handy so that you can
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.880]   mouse over the stack and see what's recently had had users growl.
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.880]   It's very nice.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.520]   Free works completely smoothly and transparently.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:26.400]   And makes spaces really, in many ways, a lot more useful because each space gets its own
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.800]   doc as well as its own windows in the space.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.640]   Doc Spaces 1.3 from Patrick Hamelo.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.800]   And thank you for underseen for recommending that to me on Twitter.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.920]   I really appreciate it.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.920]   Moving along to Mr. Anne, let's see.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.600]   Who have we missed?
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.600]   Scott, we did.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.600]   Alex, we did Andy Naco.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.360]   Have you got to pick for us?
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.360]   Yes.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.600]   You know, I'm really disappointed with the car window mounts.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.600]   Oh, shut up.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600]   Never mind.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:25:00.000]   I just like getting time on the microphone.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.720]   I got what I got.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.320]   Let's Chris Breen's last but not least.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.120]   Yeah, let's actually the mute button on my phone.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.920]   Okay, we've all used the Flip Minnow.
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:11.920]   Yes.
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:12.920]   Yes.
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:13.920]   And we like it.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.920]   Yes.
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:15.920]   Okay.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.160]   Well, starting today, you can customize the look of your Flip Minnow when you purchase
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.640]   one for a gift, for example.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:26.560]   They have a new service that they're offering along with Cafe Press.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.000]   The idea is you buy your Minnow and then you can customize it with a number of built-in
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   designs they've got.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.520]   Or you can upload your own pictures just like you can with Flickr and you can apply
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.520]   this to a Minnow and then they will ship this thing to you.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:40.880]   It's not a sticker.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.760]   They actually heat the plastic and it becomes a tattoo.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.000]   So your design gets tattooed onto a Minnow.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.160]   So if you don't like the look of the thing after a while, you have to buy a new one.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.200]   Or you can design it and then you can send it as an email link to somebody and say, "Hey,
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.040]   I really like the look of this, but I don't have 180 bucks."
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.640]   And, you know, the holidays are coming up.
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.960]   So how about this?
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.520]   Another nice idea is that when you come up with a design and you apply it to a thing,
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.560]   you can also sell your design.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.520]   And if somebody else picks up a Minnow and uses your design, you get 10 bucks or you
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.120]   can offer it for free.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.120]   Yep.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.440]   I love this.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.440]   So there's like a gallery.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.440]   Where is it online at?
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:24.360]   Yeah, just go to theflip.com.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.960]   And in there you will find when you go to products, at the very top, this Flip Minnow
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:33.440]   and it has a little thing where it says small, sleek and totally designable.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.280]   And they have a nice, easy to use interface.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.200]   And you figure it's because I just bought a Flip Minnow like two weeks ago.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:42.640]   Yeah, well this makes a really nice gift now because, you know, whether it's your partner
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:48.400]   or if it's a kid or something, you can apply a very specific image to the Minnow that's
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.960]   going to mean everything to them and nothing to anybody else.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.960]   And that's really what they're sort of going for here is that rather than...
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:57.960]   They're beautiful.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.960]   Look at those.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:26:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:05.680]   Rather than looking at the ZI-6, which is more sort of like the nerd HD in your hand,
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.680]   this is more like...
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.800]   The kids are very personalized and not expensive.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.920]   It fits in your pocket easily and it looks like nobody else's Minnow.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:19.600]   I love it that you can kind of make some money on it if you really have a good design too.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.320]   And it's not a sticker so it really is integrated.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.720]   No, it actually is put into the plastic.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:30.080]   So it does not come off easily but the problem is it does not come off easily.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.080]   Right.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.080]   Well you could put...
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.520]   Yes, and I'll put your picture of your girlfriend on it then is what you're saying.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.600]   Well, you know, unless you're really committed or if not, you know, it's 180 bucks and that's
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.600]   the tax for breaking up.
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.600]   You know what would be cool?
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:45.480]   Maybe there's one of the designs has a couple, a wedding couple on it.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.120]   This would be a great little thing, a gift for a wedding.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.720]   Give a few people these cameras with your pictures on them and have them shoot a video from your
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.720]   wedding.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:54.720]   There you go.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.720]   Well, that's cool.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:56.720]   That's really cool.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.800]   I am the proud possessor of a Martin Scorsese limited edition flip lineup.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.440]   That's awesome.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.440]   I got my...
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:08.840]   They gave me access to it last week and I started playing around with it.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:09.840]   You will not believe how cool.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.280]   There's a photo of it up on my site because it came...
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:16.200]   It just arrived yesterday and the transfer is rock solid.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:19.960]   It is like a coating of plastic on top of the surface of a white mine.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.960]   It is a mine.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:21.960]   Oh, not a minnow.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.960]   One in not two.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   Or I'm sorry.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:31.000]   Even flip says it's minnow but I insist that I'm right and everybody else is wrong.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   So if I keep this kind of...
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   Oh, okay.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000]   I'm just pronouncing it.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.360]   I'm substituting your reality in my own.
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:39.800]   Because minnow sounds like a little fish which is I presume what they're going for.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.120]   Two ends if it's the flip minnow.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.120]   You're right.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.480]   It really is a Martin Scorsese.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.880]   I thought you were joking.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.280]   I made a photo...
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.280]   I should post it.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:56.480]   I made a Photoshop template because the only difficulty in posting your own JPEG for this
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:03.560]   design is that the lens and that chrome bar in the middle of the device just gets in
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.160]   the way of everything.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.160]   So you have to figure out how to incorporate that into the design.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.920]   The colors are absolutely spot on.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:13.400]   As a matter of fact, when it came, I was sort of doubting that I would remember that the
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:14.960]   colors were as good as that.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:20.320]   I mean, because I was literally holding it up next to my color corrected screen and saying
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.360]   my God, that is exactly what I was seeing.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.520]   Also the alignment tools are also really much better than they need to be because I was
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.160]   doing silly things like saying I wanted...
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:36.480]   I had a frame grab from that great saw bass title sequence from Casino at the top edge
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:37.480]   of it.
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:41.800]   I wanted to line up the directed by Martin Scorsese halfway between the lens and the
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.200]   top of the case.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:47.720]   And of course you get this Java or whatever tool for after you upload your JPEG for lining
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:48.720]   everything up.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.480]   I thought, okay, I just better hope that it comes close.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.400]   I best not to come anywhere near that end.
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.080]   I took a screen capture...
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.760]   And the screen captures up on my site.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:03.520]   I took a screen capture and it looks exactly how it was lined up in the thing.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.520]   And it's free.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:08.080]   In fact, it's no cost, no more than a blank mine.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.080]   I was surprised.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.760]   I would have thought that, well, look, you're close to 200 bucks anyway.
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.920]   What if you kite this up an extra 20 bucks and make this custom feature?
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.760]   But no, if you want it, just upload a picture.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.760]   They're gonna sell a lot of these.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:18.760]   This is great.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:21.640]   In fact, why didn't Apple think of this for the iPod?
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:22.640]   Seriously.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:28.280]   Because Steve Jobs doesn't have that much time to observe every single iPod coming out
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.040]   of that line and approve every single iPod.
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:36.200]   What I love about this is that I think a lot of us when we were speaking at Macworld, got
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.200]   these jealouskins.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.000]   I love the jealouskins.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   I love it.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.800]   I have to say, of all the things that I own, the thing I get the most comments on is my
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.800]   jealouskins.
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:47.800]   And I love having this customization.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:52.400]   It's a lot easier for me to figure out which computer is mine.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:53.400]   But it's...
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:31:00.800]   I have to say, I will not jealouskin the new Macbook though, because it's shiny aluminum.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.800]   Should I?
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:02.800]   I don't know.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:03.800]   I think the jealouskins works best on a plastic MacBook.
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:08.680]   Well, you know, I have it on my laptop and I've been very happy with it.
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:12.680]   And what I can't believe is it's been on for almost a year now and it barely shows a
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.680]   nick.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.680]   Yeah, mine too.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.680]   Really looks great.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.840]   I've covered my new computer with motorcycle stickers.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.240]   What's your newest motorcycle?
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:23.320]   The Harley Davidson Road King.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.320]   2008.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:28.960]   I think there is actually a commonality between Harley's and Apple's.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:33.040]   Yep, it's a brand people go nuts for and pay too much for.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.520]   Pay a little premium as a result.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.320]   Hey, great pick, Chris Breen.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.320]   That's really fantastic.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.320]   I love that.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:45.360]   The new Flip Minnow with special graphics on it.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:51.480]   And I should have mentioned it, but OpenOffice 3.0 is now out with native Mac support.
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.640]   Still looks like a 1994 application, unfortunately.
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:32:00.040]   And the office will be updated, I'm sure, to include the changes in the 3.0.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.720]   But you no longer have to run X window to use OpenOffice 3.0.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.480]   That's just came out this week.
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:09.080]   And I thank you, Ryan Shrout, from PC Perspective for joining us.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.840]   I appreciate it sitting in with all these Mac fanatics.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:13.160]   Hey, no problem.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.160]   You held your own.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.920]   But in Apple wasn't anti-Mac.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.560]   No, you said you have a Mac.
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.560]   You switched.
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.560]   So you can't.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.560]   I have one.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.560]   I don't know if I want to say I've switched.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.560]   That would be bad for business.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:25.560]   Still experimented in college.
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:26.560]   No more.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:34.160]   Andy Enoco is at the, by the way, Ryan's at PC perspective was his PCPR.com.
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.800]   A really great enthusiast site for people who do want to know what the latest hardware
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:39.880]   and chipsets are.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:44.120]   And a great article on the NVIDIA chipsets, if you want to read more about those.
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.440]   Andy Enoco is at the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.440]   Enoco.com.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.560]   Also, of course, at the Chicago Sun times, we thank you so much for being here.
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:56.360]   If you can't spell my last name, which I couldn't do as of four years ago, C-W-O-B.com will take
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.040]   you to Enoco.com just as well.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:32:59.040]   There you go.
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.440]   Don't forget the dub dub dub.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.440]   And Brian.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:03.440]   Chris Green is the Mac Daddy.
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.160]   He is senior editor at Macworld Magazine.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.640]   Always a welcome guest on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.160]   We're so glad we could get you on.
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.640]   We'll do the phone thing from now on that way.
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:12.120]   We won't have to worry about Skype.
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.120]   Excellent.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.120]   Sounds great.
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.120]   Yeah, it's really good to have you here.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.120]   Thank you, Chris.

[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.600]   Scott Borne and Alex Bother are on Twitch Photo this weekend.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.840]   Oh, it's photography.
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:34.840]   It took photo.com.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:35.840]   And I would come.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:38.880]   Oh, and now all I was going to say is I would like to say, you know, we've been kind of
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:39.880]   quiet.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.960]   I think we talked about it a little bit when I first launched, but you know, we've been
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.080]   working at Kirsten Sanford from this weekend Science and I have been working on potential
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.280]   energy for a couple of weeks now, a couple of months now.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.280]   And I'm really proud of it.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:51.280]   What is that about?
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.280]   Potential energy.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.280]   Potential energy.
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.280]   It's all about renewable energy.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.280]   It's about it.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:00.560]   And we're getting some of the best experts in the world to talk about everything from,
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:06.880]   you know, solar to clean water to, you know, nuclear energy, you know, all these things.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.800]   And it's, you know, I didn't want to say too much about it until we got our feet under
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.840]   us, but it's turned out to be a really, really good show.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840]   So I would, it's great.
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.840]   It's available on iTunes.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.680]   I can't wait to see it.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:18.680]   Thank you very much.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.440]   She's, I love Kiki.
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:21.440]   Yeah, she is.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.080]   I love Dr. Kiki.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.080]   All right.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.880]   And by the way, I've been playing with this LX3 myself.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:28.920]   You talk me into getting one, Scott Borne.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.040]   Are you, are you happy with it still?
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.000]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.280]   It's a, it's very nice camera and I sent the G10 back.
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:37.280]   Really?
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.280]   Yep.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.280]   Wow.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.280]   I like the wide angle.
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:43.960]   I'm not sure how, how good it'll be for more telephoto situations.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:47.160]   Well, I have a, I have a Sigma three to 800 to cover that.
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.160]   Oh, see, that's what I figured.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:52.320]   You don't really need the, you know, I'm going to, it's, I'm going to do telephoto
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.320]   work.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.320]   It's not going to be with my point and shoot.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.480]   No, I, and the video coming off this is really great.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.560]   The Lumix, it's better than, it's better than the G9.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.560]   I'm, I'm impressed.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:04.280]   I love the big LCD on the back.
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280]   So I got this for Jennifer.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:08.280]   She wanted a point and shoot, but I think I'm going to keep it.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.280]   I like it.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.280]   I like it too much.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.280]   Thank you everybody.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.520]   I will see you next week.
