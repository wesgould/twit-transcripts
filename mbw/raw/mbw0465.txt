[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.560]   As always, or almost always, part of the regulars here. Good to see you.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   Are you wearing a white band with your Apple watch?
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   Yes, I bought the... I got the stormtrooper edition.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   I took your advice and I got a cheapo leather band, which I really like, a red leather band.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560]   Looks just like the classic buckle minus the cost.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   They're pretty good. You got to love the Apple design to go for $150 for leather band.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   They're really nice but yikes.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   Yeah, they look... I mean, of course, I'm sure they're better made.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.560]   All that.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMourne.com, we're in this WWDC last year hat.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.560]   Yeah, because my hair looks like a triple dyed on my head this morning, so I put this on.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.560]   And also, I thought it would counteract Dowrymple's...
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.560]   Bruins hat if he was wearing one.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   Don't taunt the man.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.560]   He's actually in a bad mood, I think, but we'll find out if he presses a man in the rabbit's head.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   Jim Dowrymple, loopinsight.com.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.560]   It's good to have you on the show.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560]   Good to be here, Leo.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   I don't know about your other guests, but, you know...
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   Hey, they're all right.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   Really?
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.560]   Are you...
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.560]   Looks like you're outside enjoying the weather.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   I am.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   Nice.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   Very nice.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   Well, I'm glad you could do that.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   Nitrozak at Snaggy explained what happened for Mr. Dowrymple when he lost those thousands
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   of songs.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   According to...
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   Do you see my screen?
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.560]   Nitrozak at Snaggy, his song was slipped out of his pockets, got lost in his couch, where
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.560]   the cleaners inadvertently vacuumed them up and sent them to the fifth dimension who put
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   them on a soul train with Ozzy Osbourne driving that crazy train.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.560]   Then they went through the desert on a horse with no name where they were searching for
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.560]   a heart of gold, but that took them for a walk on the wild side where they saw the needle
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   and the damage done after which they were stuck inside a mobile.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   Actually, that mobile with the Memphis blues again, a nice picture of Jim.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   See, Apple Music makes perfect sense now, doesn't it?
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   Coming into Los Angeles, bringing in a couple of authorization.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   Sorry.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   Good explanation, as any, I mean to their credit.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   So give us an update, Jim, because the last...
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   You seem like you've found most of them, but I think you've got some extra help.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:33.560]   Well, I did go in and see Apple, but a lot of what happened was based on iTunes match.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.560]   So the way that iTunes match used to work is that you would enable iTunes match, which
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   show you your purchases, your uploaded files, and your matched files.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   Well, when they made Apple Music, the iTunes match service now only shows you your purchase
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   files.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.560]   So Apple Music wasn't working well for me.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.560]   There were some bugs and duplicated files and not files showing up.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.560]   Say that again.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   iTunes match now doesn't show stuff I've uploaded, only stuff I purchased from iTunes.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.560]   Right.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   But iTunes match, there's an option in iTunes now to turn on iCloud Music Library.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:25.560]   iCloud Music Library includes your uploaded songs and your matched songs and your purchase
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.560]   songs.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   I understand the confusion.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.960]   The way that I always used iTunes match was I turned on iTunes match and it showed all
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.080]   of those three categories of songs for me.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:45.720]   So when Apple Music was showing me some bugs or whatever was going on there, I turned off
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.360]   Apple Music, turned off iCloud Music Library because that is part of Apple Music.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   So I'm left with my library of songs, but they're not all there.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.400]   So apparently they were there the whole time because iTunes match is now part of iCloud
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.520]   Music Library.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:15.080]   And there's a couple hundred songs now that are missing that I guess I deleted myself.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:23.560]   When I was trying to get rid of Apple Music, Apple pointed out that I guess I deleted them.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.560]   They said the songs never went anywhere, Jim.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.480]   Never went anywhere except the ones that I deleted.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:36.920]   So the songs that I deleted, I'm going to go back in and rebuy because they were my Aussie
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.600]   collection and my Black Sabbath collection, which I think there's about 200 songs.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   You had hypothesized that it was because you had the same song on two albums.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.440]   On the original album and a compilation, things like that.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.400]   I mean, it's very confusing to me.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:02.960]   I know that I downloaded a compilation of Aussie and a couple of compilations of Black Sabbath.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:11.600]   So when I decided that I would just delete them all together, get rid of Apple Music,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.040]   I went in and deleted those songs.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:25.080]   So I'm not sure if I deleted the compilation and Apple Music associated that with my files
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.280]   and deleted those.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:35.440]   Or if I actually downloaded these individual Aussie albums that I already had in my library
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.640]   and deleted those.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:44.400]   No, I didn't actually delete the files, but I deleted my own music off of iTunes Match
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.560]   because I had iCloud Music Library enabled iTunes Match as part of that.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.080]   So I could have deleted my own files.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:57.600]   The other files were there the whole time, but because of the way that iTunes Match works,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   is this making any sense?
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.280]   Yeah, no, it makes perfect sense.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   Okay.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.720]   And I also understand the confusion because Apple changed the behavior.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.040]   I mean, maybe they explain it somewhere, but they really changed how iTunes Match works.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.080]   So I would have been, I would have been Baffle too.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.040]   But you did say in the headline, the first story, I am through with Apple Music.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040]   Yes.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.200]   Are you still through with Apple Music?
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.680]   I haven't, I haven't turned it back on yet.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.680]   No.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.680]   No.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.480]   And do you think it took unprecedented and by unprecedented, I mean helped that no one
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.760]   else would have gotten from Apple to get this sorted out?
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.480]   I'm not really sure.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:45.960]   I mean, it's not like Apple pulled me in and, and you know, magically recovered all of
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.200]   my files because of- They didn't give you a special treatment, right?
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   No.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.560]   You know, there was, there was nothing like that.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.680]   I mean, those files were there.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.600]   They just explained what happened.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   Right.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.280]   And, and I brought my computer in.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:07.240]   I brought a few other devices in and they, they went through them and had a look and said,
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.400]   well, here are your files right here.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.360]   So the files were there.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.240]   It's just with the way that things changed and how they worked.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.280]   It wasn't clear to me that they actually were there.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280]   Right.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.040]   So if I had one wish for iTunes right now, it would be to put match back the way that
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.280]   it was.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.960]   So that I could turn on iTunes match, turn off Apple music if I wanted to and turn off
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:37.320]   iCloud music library if I wanted to, because Apple, Apple music needs iCloud music library.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.800]   So if I could do that, I'd be very happy.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.720]   I think that as a match subscriber, I pay for iTunes match, have since it came out, I can
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:54.520]   open up any device until now I could open up any device and just have iTunes match was
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.680]   just my music.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   Right.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.960]   Uploaded, matched and purchased.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.000]   That's, that's what I want at this point.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.560]   Can you not do that now?
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.560]   No.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.440]   So whether you use Apple music or not, iTunes match has changed its behavior.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.440]   Right.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.440]   Right.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.400]   iTunes match has changed its behavior regardless of what you do with Apple music.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:25.640]   So you can, if you turn on iCloud music library, you can have your old iTunes match.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.320]   That's not my behavior.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.640]   But the problem that I have right now is with Apple music.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.120]   So if I turn that on, then Apple music is part of iCloud music library and I don't want
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.120]   that.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.680]   Yeah, you can turn off Apple music.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.720]   You can't turn off Apple music.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.920]   You can turn off the preference to show Apple music, but it's still going to be in the background.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.680]   So is there a chance that, you know, in a month or six months that I'll use Apple music
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.680]   again?
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.680]   Sure.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:59.080]   Right now, you know, there's, they're coming out with a fix for a lot of the most common
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.480]   problems that we've talked about all over the internet.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.840]   You know, duplicate songs and, you know, when you add an album, it wouldn't add songs that
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.080]   you already had in your library somewhere else.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.080]   That's not right.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.760]   If I want to add an album, I should be able to add the album and you can do that now.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.120]   There are people out there laughing saying, well, that's what you get for using iTunes.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.240]   The first place we have really, I had really hoped maybe it wasn't.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.960]   I had really hoped that they would rewrite iTunes from scratch with the release of Apple
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.360]   music.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   That was not to be.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.600]   I think part of the problem is still that they had kind of this legacy system and they
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.440]   have this new system and they changed the way the legacy system behaved to make it work
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.920]   with the new system, but they didn't really fully explain.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.840]   I was always confused about what happens to match when you do music and all of that.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.200]   And obviously somebody like you who was an accomplished Apple user was confused.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.000]   Renee, did they document this very well?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.640]   They started documenting it later, which is why, you know, a little bit me, mostly serenity
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.840]   had to spend days and days and days writing article after article after article explaining
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   an iTunes match.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.200]   I'm like Jim, I only ever used iTunes match.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.040]   And that became renamed to iCloud Music Library and it got conflated with Apple music.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.760]   And it's not so much that the processes changed, but that the way you access them and the naming
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.960]   and all of it became very confused.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.320]   And the systems, they explained them in very similar ways and we had that whole issue with
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.720]   what's DRM and what's not DRM.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.640]   And a lot of this is just them with a new service figuring out, you know, oh, people are confused
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   by this.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.640]   How do we fix it?
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   But that's that's very late.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.160]   I would, the people have been saying like, you know, like I've, iCloud Photo Library didn't
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   have this problem.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.040]   You could just turn it on and it worked.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.640]   But the difference is there's no, I had lots of problems with confusion.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   That's absolutely true.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.440]   But the problem with this, that adds to it is that there's no huge commercial photo source
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.520]   that you're trying to comb it with all your personal problems.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.280]   It's just my photos that it screwed up.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.320]   And so for all of these things, I would much prefer that at the minute you have someone's
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.600]   critical personal data, Apple decides we're not going to touch that.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.360]   You enabling iCloud Music Library or iCloud Photo Library, we're keeping your library
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.040]   locked as is and everything that we do is going to be almost like a Delta file the way
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.960]   you get when you edit a photo that it's applied as a filter on top of your stuff.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.400]   So if you add Apple Music, that's a filter that is in between your music and the ultimate
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.800]   view that's shown in the app.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.520]   And then whatever you do, they're adding music, removing music, anything short of buying music
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.680]   that's gets added to your proper library only exists in that silo and then can never do
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.960]   anything like damaging Jim's Aussie, Aussie, Aussie-born stuff again.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:43.320]   Did Apple rush you like the promise that Apple rushed this out?
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   I don't think it's a great thing.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.640]   Well, they've been rocking on it for a long time.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.640]   I mean, this is this was it's the same problem they've had with most of their cloud services
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.480]   where they don't seem to be able to simply start small and then just simply grow out
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.120]   from a base of features that work and are reliable and people understand them.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.640]   They really are in a mindset where this doesn't work.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.120]   So we're going to have to start new revolution here.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.560]   And once again, I think that Apple Music reflects that they didn't decide that we're
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.600]   going to simplify, simplify, simplify.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.080]   We're going to turn this into some discrete experiences that everyone's going to be able
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.400]   to understand really, really easily.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.600]   Instead, it was we're going to make sure that everything that we already have is still
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.280]   there somewhere in the foundations.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.680]   They're still sending, you know, roots and tendrils up into into the concrete, but we're
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.360]   also going to be pouring brand new concrete.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.800]   And so there's so much confusion as to what still works, what doesn't work, what is gone,
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.960]   what is new and what is supposed to work, but you have to turn some things off in order
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   to make it happen.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.760]   Yeah, like the one of the problems again is that it has your data behind it.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.680]   Like it has Jim's music collection or Leo's photo collection.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.440]   And if it was just a Delta file or just a filter, you could literally just flip a switch
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.120]   and it would be gone and you'd see your old music.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.280]   And if you turn it back on, your stuff would be there and there'd never be any damage
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.640]   to your core files.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.840]   I understand raffles coming from with all of this.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.200]   And it's not like there's a bunch of evil people out there who want to go and destroy
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   your stuff.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   No, no, no.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.880]   They have this idea that they can make that people are easily confused and they don't
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.760]   have everything in one place and they add Apple music and it's not in my music, then
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.760]   where did that Apple music go?
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.760]   And it's a series of decisions that when you're when you're stuck in launching a product,
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.920]   you see one way and then the rest of the world hits it like millions of people and it makes
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.880]   little sense to them because they haven't been embroiled in those discussions.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.280]   But at a certain point, all this to your point, like this is the legacy stuff catches up with
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   you and iTunes was designed.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.920]   Like I can't even imagine what iTunes must look like from Apple.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:42.000]   It was designed for people to upload music over 10 years ago and that system has now
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.400]   been scaled to apps to device management.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   It has to be ported to Windows.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.600]   Everyone says Apple has to rewrite it and yeah, but it's it's a billion dollar business
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.280]   that does billions of dollars in transactions with hundreds of millions of credit cards
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.920]   and it's non trivial to scrap that and build something new.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.480]   They probably are building things in parallel right now and testing them very carefully.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.280]   But I can't imagine the the creepy web objects back end that all this stuff is at least partially
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.600]   still dependent on and that that project could be started fresh.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.800]   It could be simplified.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.280]   It could be broken out, but there's all sorts of usability and just simple portability problems
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.280]   that need to be solved.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.480]   And I think those are going to be really difficult and likely a multi year project.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.320]   Yeah, but Apple Apple's done difficult things like that before.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.920]   I mean, they've built the Apple watch.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.800]   So I really have to believe that this is a solvable problem.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.680]   I just it's just a terrible thing that I think the thing that really hurts is knowing that
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.480]   I don't know anybody who trusts iTunes.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.040]   I don't know anybody who trusts any Apple cloud service right now.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.520]   It's not because they're dumb.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.200]   It's because man, what is what what fresh hell awaits me as soon as I flip this one switch
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.640]   as soon as I have if I have the option between yes, I want to install that now and maybe
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:58.000]   later there is no can we talk about this later because I'm not sure we understand this.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.880]   I mean, I had a I didn't have any problems with with Apple music chiefly because I wanted
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.540]   to make sure there was a complete backup of all my music and not only that, but an air
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.720]   gap between Apple music and whatever drive that backup was being stored on.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.360]   That's how little I trusted it.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.880]   And I had I had largely a really good experience with it, but only because with my real music
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:24.960]   library in safekeeping, I would say, well, let's create a brand new iTunes library.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.720]   Let me approach this as though I'm a brand new user who came home with their with a Mac
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.880]   for the first time.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.280]   And it works very, very well.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.760]   And unfortunately, that's that underscores a lot of Apple cloud stuff where it works
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.760]   great.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:43.760]   So long as you can start from zero with a vision of music or photos or or or cloud sinking,
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.200]   that matches the way that Apple did it.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.200]   I think that I would be great if Apple could if they could build a system where it says,
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.720]   no matter how you like to organize your music library, no matter where you like to get your
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.520]   music from this, we'll support it.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:02.920]   Feel like if you're the company that says so often, it just works.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.120]   You put yourself in a position where there's a higher expectation.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.960]   Yeah, they don't say anymore.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.240]   They say we believe now.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.240]   We've gone.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.880]   We've gone from it just works to it mostly just works with sort of aim to try.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.440]   We hope it works.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.000]   Gosh, we hope it works.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.760]   No, but I think this is damaging.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.240]   Isn't this damaging to Apple in the long run?
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.680]   I mean, look, it never was true that it just worked.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.860]   Everybody knows that.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.680]   But Apple somehow had this kind of gilded reputation of really getting stuff done, getting
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.680]   it right.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.480]   They survived mobile milio.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.240]   I mean, you can go back and point out product after product where it just didn't work.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.160]   Nevertheless, there is this there or around Apple that they get it right.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.800]   And the more this kind of stuff happens, doesn't it eventually start to start to tarnish that
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   reputation?
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.880]   You know, when you look at cloud services, there are a lot of things that developers
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.760]   would like to see, you know, cloud services work better.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:07.800]   But as an average user, me looking at things like calendar contacts, all the syncing that
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.400]   goes back and forth all the time, that works flawlessly for me.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.760]   I've been using it for years.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.040]   It works great.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.200]   So I can, here's what I would do.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.720]   I get a Mac or I get an iPhone or an iPad.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:28.240]   I sign in with my Apple ID bookmarks, calendars, contacts, everything is sent to that device.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.720]   I turn on iTunes match.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:37.440]   This is before and all my music is saying in the good on this with within minutes.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.400]   My device, whatever that device is, is synced.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   I got a plan though.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.880]   My works great was late to that party, but does it now?
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   Google does it very well.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.120]   If you use a Chromebook, the Chromebook becomes yours instantly.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.360]   Well, maybe we can call that person and yeah, let's get that person working for Apple.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.240]   But that is the expectation now because the world has changed a lot.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.800]   I mean, Apple started into time when people had a computer and now they're in a time where
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.880]   people have many devices and Apple has sold the notion that this ecosystem works best when
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:14.960]   it's all Apple and that that is the dream what you just described, Jim.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.400]   Yeah, I think it's what Andy said before about the ambition of the project too.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.560]   I mean, they came out and proudly said, you know, Jimmy and I have been said, we want
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.640]   one consistent thought about music and that includes radio and that includes streaming
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.680]   and that includes connect and you have all this functionality together that from a certain
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.120]   point of view, make sense because you why have people run around to different apps to get
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   their music.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.960]   But when you look at it, for example, I don't have almost any music like when Jim's collection
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.960]   to me is unfathomable.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.400]   I've just never bought a lot of music.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.920]   I watch TV mostly, but I can say to I watch Netflix with some people.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   Listen to radio.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.760]   So my collection is very different, but Apple music to me means anytime I want, I can say,
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.640]   Hey, Siri play this and it just magically starts playing any song I want any time I
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.040]   want more of this.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.880]   I almost I have almost nothing in my library and I use Siri almost all the time and it's
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.240]   it's nearly miraculous for me.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.320]   But to cater to my user state and Jim's user state in one product sounds like a nightmare
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.400]   near nine impossible situation to me.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.520]   So maybe if you started smaller and you had Apple music as a as sort of like a service
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.480]   that doesn't touch whatever traditional service people are using, or again, is that sort of
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.920]   filter on top of it, then you sort of don't set yourself up for these massive personal
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.520]   data problems that you run into.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:29.440]   Well, and it is no small feat to try and make a service work for all of us.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.480]   I mean, there are people out there that have monstrous libraries.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.520]   There are people that I think the people that are enjoying Apple music the most are the
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.400]   ones that don't have big libraries.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.800]   You know, I don't consider mine all that big.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:49.960]   I mean, but still, you know, through confusion, I think mine would have been okay if things
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   had have worked.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.960]   Like I thought that they worked.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:22:02.800]   I have to think when you see Marco Arment and John Gruber and Jim Dalrymple all complaining
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.200]   that this stuff's not working.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.800]   That starts to move the train out of the station a little bit.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.640]   I think one of the differences is that Apple has never been a company.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.680]   Apple makes the deal with the user saying that we're going to take stuff.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.440]   We're going to take a lot of problems off your hands.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.880]   We're going to solve problems for you.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:28.480]   That's the optimal situation for, I would say, more situations than not.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.800]   But sometimes you would much rather be able to have control over something than have things
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.280]   done for you automatically.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.440]   Most of the time when I have problems with my iTunes library, I will find out, I will
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.520]   look at my library and feel like, oh, okay, that's because once I ripped just three tracks
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.800]   off of this album and then put the rest away.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.600]   That's a self-dating user.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.600]   You don't blame yourself.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.600]   You blame the company.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.400]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   You can take a look.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.920]   No, that's not self-hating.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.240]   It's about taking a look at here's what just happened here.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.240]   Okay.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.800]   I accidentally put two copies of this thing.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.920]   Oh, no, because sometimes it is my fault.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.080]   Never your fault.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.680]   I would like that in writing.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.600]   I'd like an affidavit to that effect because I could make great use of that statement.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.360]   What I'm saying is that the most frustrating thing isn't a situation which you screwed
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   yourself up.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.560]   It's a situation in which, wow, I had 6,000 pieces of music in my library.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.800]   Now I have eight.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.320]   I don't know where they went.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.760]   And after 45 minutes of looking at things, I have no idea where they went or how to get
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   them back.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.600]   Well, now there is a drum beat.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.760]   I've been loved joy writing a nine to five Mac.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.400]   iTunes is now so clunky.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.000]   The only safe solution is to nuke it from orbit.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.640]   Marco Arman saying if Apple had only done with iTunes, what they did with photos, they
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.120]   would have a decent product and on and Gruber saying exacto mundo.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.160]   Why don't we get a new iTunes?
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.520]   I think the world has agreed.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.120]   Now it's too late right now.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.560]   You've got legacy music now in there.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.760]   And now you're really screwed.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.760]   You should have done it now.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.480]   This was the time they waited a long time after buying beats before putting out Apple
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.480]   music.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.600]   What was that a year?
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.960]   A big, a really big thing to try and put together though.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.600]   You know, I don't know if they could have done a new iTunes in time for an Apple music
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600]   launch.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.640]   I mean, when he explained it earlier, that's it's huge.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.400]   It's a huge job.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.560]   But you know, it's dependencies, laden with dependencies.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.280]   Well, it's not getting better.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.960]   Now it's got more dependencies.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   Yes.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.800]   It's because I only it's basically you're it's like you're it's like Jimmy Hoffa.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   You're now encased in cement.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.880]   So the interesting thing about like, like if you look at Marco's article, you look at
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.440]   John's exacto mundo, or you look at some of the other articles, they're both absolutely
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.200]   right and non helpful at the same time.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.640]   So like from our perspective, from a user perspective, Apple just needs to fix this.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.200]   Like everyone says, it's Apple's job to out to fix this.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.540]   It behooves us to understand the size of the problems we can set our expectations for
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.160]   timelines and things like that.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.000]   But at the bottom line, Apple absolutely has to fix this.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.720]   If iTunes is unworkable for not only a majority of users, but for core users who have using
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.200]   it for years, that is a huge problem that needs to be solved.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.960]   Understanding the technical and commercial debt of iTunes can make us say, well, they
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.200]   should they can fix this in a year.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.560]   They can fix this in two years and three years.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.400]   And maybe they've already been spending that time doing it.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   We just haven't seen it.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.040]   Rumors that there was a new music app that was supposed to launch with Apple music.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.520]   But for some reason, it didn't work out and had to put everything back into iTunes.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.160]   And maybe that's maybe that's true.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.480]   Maybe that's not.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.560]   But usually there are these projects working on like photos.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.680]   They announced that at WWC, it came out for Mac earlier on this year, I think some six
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:48.200]   or eight months later, and it's going to be iterated again in El Capitan.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.320]   And I wouldn't be surprised if we if we see a lot of that happening.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:56.200]   But the big problem they have to solve is that iTunes is lives on incredibly creaky
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.760]   old infrastructure, things like web objects, things like the iTunes back end, which podcasters,
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.880]   if you've got podcast access, you've seen the best version possible that not all of
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.120]   it's that nice.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.720]   And they have to move all that to modern web infrastructure.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.880]   And maybe they have to move iTunes to the cloud.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.240]   The way I work is on the cloud now, iTunes can be on the cloud, then you have to then
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.400]   you can drop PC compatibilities.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.360]   You don't have to port everything, bundle it up, make it run on Windows and have just
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.120]   a bunch of separate Mac clients, the way you do on iOS.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.160]   But all of those pieces have to be built together, all the DRM for videos that they
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.880]   still sell that are bundled up in fair play.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.280]   All of that device management device thing, all of that has to be rationally thought out
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:38.720]   with as many edge use cases as possible, and then rolled out into the operating system.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.200]   And that that is a huge task.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.800]   And I wouldn't be surprised if that is a multi-year.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.360]   I'll tell you what the problem is.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.800]   And it is a deep rooted problem.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:51.360]   It's a problem of hubris that Apple in its desire to continue to grow at this rapid pace
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:58.160]   wants to own the entire ecosystem from A to Z or A to Z in your case.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.680]   And even Microsoft doesn't do that anymore.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.000]   Even this is nuts.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.880]   And to be there, they're biting off more than they can chew in their greed.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.080]   And I'm sorry, they're going to screw the pooch.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.080]   Go ahead.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   I don't think that's true.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.120]   I mean, to be fair, Microsoft doesn't have the ability to control the ecosystem.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.760]   So they have to adapt to the world that Apple didn't use to.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.840]   But now Apple says, Oh, we're big enough.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.400]   We're going to do the whole damn thing.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.960]   And they do a crap job.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.800]   Well, it's not a crap job.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.080]   But they remember that they have they have a consistent philosophy, which is that again,
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:41.000]   you buy an Apple product, we will try to take care of as many of as many of your problems
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.360]   as we possibly can.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.320]   And you can just make sure that those products will make everything work together.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.680]   And by and large, they do.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.560]   It's just that when they drop the ball, that same philosophy makes it very, very difficult
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.880]   for a user to feel as though they have control to solve the problem specifically for music.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.800]   For instance, they don't have they don't know that's this problem with photos, because
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.600]   they've never really tried to solve that problem in a comprehensive way.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.840]   If even if the new version of photos isn't going to isn't suitable for your use, there
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.640]   are all kinds of third party apps, including Lightroom, including professional apps that
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.480]   will let you take control of your photo library and organize it the way that you want.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.880]   There is no concurrent solution for music.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.440]   Really if you want to organize a music library and have it useful to other apps, you have
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.440]   to use iTunes.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.560]   And if iTunes is borked, your entire music experience is borked, which is why I would
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.440]   love to see Apple do this is not I'm not even the hundredth person to deposit this, but
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.240]   it would be great if Apple simply broke out the library on device, man library management
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:41.040]   as a separate app or as a separate experience and had the ability to keep tweaking that
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.920]   and improving that as it goes.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.880]   And also creating new opportunities for third parties to create replacements for that app.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.480]   So that once you have you'll have an app that's optimized for people who just buy things off
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:57.480]   the iTunes store or are or are satisfied with Spotify or Apple streaming music, but also
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:04.600]   apps that will satisfy people who have 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 tracks on there.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.880]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.760]   Apple increases its revenue 38% and loses $60 billion on the stock market.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.960]   I don't understand.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.000]   We'll have to figure this all out for high finance 101 coming up in just a second.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.120]   I'm really thrilled to have Jim Dowerimple, editor in chief of loop insight.com here.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.320]   It's great to have you Jim.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.560]   Always like being here.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   You've never been here.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.560]   I have.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.360]   Well, I've been on on tour people.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.200]   Yeah, but never on that break week.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   Never on back or we're going to be over sign on our I found that you had something against
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.840]   me and I don't.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.320]   I think the world of you.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.560]   It's like when you know the Tom Cruise is in town and you want to invite them to your
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.800]   graduation party, but you figure he already has plans for Tuesday night.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   It's exactly that.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.320]   We're not going to hear.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.440]   Also, what we're telling you is that we're going to be really annoying now every time
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.840]   the reason that even a hint that someone's not going to be available.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   You're going to be one of the first calls.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840]   We're right away right away.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   I'll be here.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   Good dealio.

[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.240]   And the thousands of little details really can make it feel overwhelming.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.040]   Plus, nobody really starts a business to deal with paperwork.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:28.640]   It's one of the reasons, you know, I think just works is a great idea.

[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   Weekly.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.240]   I just love the stock market.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.160]   Apple has a record profit.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.640]   38% profit growth.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.000]   Robust growth in China.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.640]   Sales double.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.200]   Cash reserves.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.640]   Break $200 billion.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.000]   They sold 35% more iPhones year over year.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.520]   Of course, the third quarter is the slow quarter because everybody knows the new iPhones
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.520]   coming.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:25.120]   The stock market punishes them to the tune of $60 billion in market cap.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.120]   MacBreak is stupid.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.480]   They're very short term focused and they read an article that sensationalized or says
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.800]   Apple has doomed and immediately started shorting shares because they think other people will.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.760]   It's almost like casino mob mentality.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.680]   So let's ignore the stock market.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.800]   I just think it's a strange and funny thing.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.040]   5.2% drop in.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:50.200]   I don't think that any company that reports a profit of $10 billion should ever be worried
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.840]   about the stock market hitting them like that.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.160]   It's wrong.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.480]   And these expectations that the market goes down on, the expectation of analysts, they're
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.280]   just pulling them out of their butt.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:14.400]   I mean, they have these complex math equations that they want to use to say where Apple should
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.200]   be, but $10 billion profit.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   I think it's worse than that.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.680]   I think there's actual manipulation going on.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.680]   It's hard to say that.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.280]   They present an article, market watch posts, an article saying the Apple watch sales of
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.880]   tanks 90% and they show data that they don't contextualize.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.920]   And then Tim Cook has said comes out and says, well, actually we're selling more than ever
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.960]   and way more than that data suggests, but that's already cost them $4 billion in stock
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   valuation.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.760]   They're coming back, but it's up and down.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:47.720]   I'm just looking at the one month there at $123.77 to share the, of course, the low
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.360]   after the results came out was at $120.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.960]   The fact that the pattern says if you just stay in the course, you end up making money
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   every time.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.840]   Look at the stock market.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.280]   This is not a business podcast.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.520]   We're not covering business even.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.800]   I mean, I personally don't care how much money Apple makes.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.960]   I'm more interested in it.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.240]   Does Apple make a product you should use and how to use it better?
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.240]   That's what we care about.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.480]   But I have to say this is just kind of stunning.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   Does it matter though, what the market cap is?
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.560]   Does that affect how Apple does business?
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.560]   No, not really.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:25.640]   It does, I mean, Apple has made clear over the years that they have a way that they think
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.280]   about business and a way that they think about putting out products and stores and everything
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.280]   else.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.160]   And they hold the line.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.680]   That's the way that they continue to do things.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:43.760]   So as long as they stay focused on the product and how the product affects its users, then
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.080]   they'll continue to be successful.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.240]   If they start throwing hundreds of products on the market like Samsung does just to try
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:56.400]   and see if they can increase sales, then that's a time to start to worry.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:05.840]   But otherwise, as long as Johnny Ive and Tim and Phil Schiller and Eddie Q and all of these
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.480]   the top execs keep everybody focused on what's important.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.920]   They'll be good.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.920]   That's the hard part, isn't it?
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.240]   Because then you go to the shareholders meeting and the shareholders yell at you if the stock
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   price has gone down and you get people like Carl Icahn making destructive suggestions
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.880]   about how you should run the company in order to keep the stock price up.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.600]   I'm sure that's why Apple's doing a buyback and I guess the lower price is good for the
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.880]   Apple buyback.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.880]   They're doing fine, look at this chart.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.200]   They're doing fine on cash.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.040]   And to me, that makes a difference to Apple.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.600]   That means they can acquire, they can invest in R&D.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.600]   It's fire power.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   Yeah, it's firepower.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.880]   Do you have this chart?
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.880]   There it is.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.400]   Apple, $202 billion, almost $203 billion in cash.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.120]   GE, 131.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.760]   Microsoft 96.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.760]   Google 69.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.680]   Apple, IBM 8.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   That's impressive.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.680]   Partly though, that's because Apple never does anything with that money.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.000]   Well, I'd show us that doing things with your money hasn't always been profitable when
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.520]   you look at things like the Nokia right down.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.120]   You know, it may seem to be better off keeping that cash.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.120]   Seven.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.120]   What is it?
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.400]   Microsoft had to write off after buying Nokia.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.440]   Trying basically to buy its way into this business that Apple's doing so well in the
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.760]   iPhone business.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.760]   That's exactly right.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.840]   And there's a big difference between being able to build yourself into that business and
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.280]   trying to buy into it.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.200]   I mean, Nokia, remember back, Leo, those little Nokia phones.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   They were dominant.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.560]   It was huge.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:37.800]   And then all of a sudden, you know, Blackberry came and some of the other makers came before
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.000]   2007 when the iPhone was released.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.400]   But before that, Nokia, man, they were great.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.040]   Google sold Motorola as well.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.040]   It's not easy.
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.960]   Motorola used to be the dominant smartphone, not smartphone, cell phone company.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:56.560]   That also points to why you can be so enthusiastic about Apple's future that there's going to
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.560]   there.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.960]   I think there might be a point at which whatever secret sauce that consumers perceive in the
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:07.040]   iPhone might disappear, it's something you might worry about when you start to see exactly
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:12.360]   how much money Apple here's the graph of how much money Apple makes off of the iPhone.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.040]   And then here's how much money they make off of everything else.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.560]   And you start to worry, well, what if they get Nokia out of the way or Blackberry out
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.280]   of the way of that?
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.360]   Number one, because Apple keeps trying to move the iPhone forward and they're the only
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.840]   supplier that's unlikely to happen.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.200]   But also they have all these other businesses that they're going to be cultivating and part
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.320]   of the reasons why they're free to cultivate that is because they do have enough cash reserves
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:41.680]   to experiment and have many, many, many private failures that they never have to acknowledge,
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:46.280]   never have to own up to, but will help the teach that will prevent them from having to
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.320]   make a failed product that diverts their resources and their focus.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   There also is a point where you get to lock in that people buy iPhones because everybody
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.480]   else is buying iPhone.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.480]   You know, you get this kind of momentum that is just on.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   A network effect.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.840]   And the degree to which the Apple logo is a product in and of itself.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   And if you were to put some of their products, not all their products, but some of them side
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.080]   by side, and you think, well, why are people spending so much money on the Apple one and
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.880]   they're not buying this one instead?
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.120]   And you have to figure that the Apple logo is at least a factor, at least in certain markets,
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.520]   particularly in China.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:27.120]   But they're clearly not selling themselves entirely as a fashion brand because that would
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.360]   be absolute disaster.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.480]   Well, fashion might not be the right word.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:35.160]   I mean, technology, people always bought technology based on what other people are doing.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:40.240]   I mean, Windows sold well forever and continue selling on the home where you could argue
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.680]   it shouldn't be because that's what people saw at work and they go, well, okay, there's
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.760]   this kind of herd mentality.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.280]   That's a little bit different because there are still people that, you know, when you
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.920]   talk about what is what is the budget price for a decent laptop?
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.560]   And for a lot of people, $900 does not know.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.560]   No, no, that's true.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.560]   That's the definition of a budget laptop.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.240]   Get that call on the radio show all the time.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.400]   They say, but I can buy a Windows laptop for 500 bucks or 200 bucks and they're not well.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.960]   And the $200 one is kind of crap, but it's okay if you want something for your kids to
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.640]   use, but you can actually buy a really high quality Windows notebook for $600, $700 will
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.480]   get you a very high quality one.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:22.040]   Once you start spending $900, you are almost in the premium range of Windows content.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.920]   So it's not just that.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:30.480]   I think as I've said before, I always say that Microsoft, you know, they are the gears
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:38.280]   and the grease of industry where they have the responsibility self-absorbed responsibility
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.240]   to sell computers to 90% of the people who need a computer.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:47.280]   Whereas Apple has aligned themselves to say that we will allow you to have 90% of the
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.280]   market.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.880]   We will take the 6% or the 8% of the market that will spend 40% markup on the market.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:01.160]   And actually premium device or something that has the perception of a premium device.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.840]   And so that's the difference between sitting on top of $210 billion and sitting on top
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:05.840]   of $70 million.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:11.640]   But there is still the concern that most of your profit, like 90% comes from one product.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   You have to diversify.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.080]   Is this a good problem to have?
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.880]   Oh, I love that.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.280]   And they have a lot of time to figure it out.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.280]   I mean, there's definitely some runway there.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.320]   They've got $203 billion in the bank.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.920]   You know, they could go out and buy the movie industry and just say, "Well, we'll just do
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.920]   this for now."
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.440]   I mean, there's all sorts of things you can do with that kind of money.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.920]   Little concern about iPad sales.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:42.160]   And this was again down, 13% decline over the previous quarter, year over year, 19% decline.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.040]   Sales are for the iPad are slowing.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   You see those spikes.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.600]   That's of course when new iPads are announced in Q1.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.800]   I don't think that we've seen the upgrade cycle yet for iPad.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:02.760]   If you look at iPhones, people are willing to trade an iPhone and pay extra to get the
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:06.480]   new iPhone, to get out of their current one.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.000]   But for the iPad, I think it's more along the lines of a computer upgrade.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.320]   You're willing to keep a computer for several years before you upgrade.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.480]   And that I think is what's going on here.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:25.000]   I'm still not concerned about iPad sales because I still think that we're in a situation where,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.280]   you know, in the next year or so, we're going to start to see some churn in sales and people
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.280]   upgrading.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.280]   What will stimulate that?
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.560]   Is it a newer, better product or is it the death of the old iPad?
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.920]   What is going to make people upgrade?
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.280]   Well, certainly it's going to be the death of older devices.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.720]   The battery doesn't work anymore.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.720]   Right.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.160]   You know, there's going to be little things like that.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:54.240]   The new features in the OS and certainly the hardware itself where it allows people to
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.800]   do more and more.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:02.280]   And we're starting to see that already where new OS versions and new hardware allow people
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.080]   to do more and people want to do more.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.920]   Now, there are a lot of people out there, older people and younger people who will just
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:15.000]   use an iPad for internet, for email and web surfing.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.200]   And for those ones, the older iPads are just fine.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.440]   But you know, we're still seeing iPad sales, I think, because people like me and you and
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.600]   Renee and Andy who want to do a little bit more and we'll go out and get that.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.080]   But at some point, you know, even with the oldest iPad or the oldest computer, you're
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.320]   going to do an upgrade.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.480]   And I think that when that churn starts, then we're going to see things pop a bit.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.800]   People still use their iPads, right?
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.760]   I mean, that's actually, to me, that would be the metric.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.200]   But how what sales are like, but do you see people using their iPads?
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   Yes.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.600]   It's going to be interesting to see what affect iOS 9 and if Apple does come up with an iPad
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:59.480]   Pro comes along because of again, 90% of the close 90% of the people out there are not
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:04.360]   Mac users, the Windows users, and they're going to store with $500 or $600 in their hands.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:10.320]   They may not see the reason to walk out with a 9.7 inch one app at a time, one window at
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.120]   a time, really honking huge book reader looking sort of device.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:20.720]   But it's going to be interesting when Apple has iOS 9 where they have interfaces that
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:25.400]   has been on part of Windows since Windows 8 that make it really, really efficient to
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:30.000]   be truly productive with multiple apps on this small screen at the same time.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.040]   Apple will finally have a really credible answer to the question, "I've got $500 or $600
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:39.560]   I want to buy a laptop that doesn't have to do everything but it has to do the basics
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.560]   and do them well.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.560]   What do you got for me?"
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:46.360]   Apple has never had an answer to that question but once they have the ability to simply demonstrate,
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.440]   "Here's how you run multiple apps at the same time and here's how you can be on one
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.080]   app and still be watching a video in the corner of the screen at the same time."
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.360]   I think that's going to siphon off a lot of the people who otherwise would be spending
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:02.520]   that money on a very nice Asus Windows laptop or Windows convertible.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:09.760]   On vacation I saw a lot of, I was surprised to see a lot of Android ad tablets.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.920]   I saw quite a few iPads and by the way, much older crowd, okay?
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.640]   So it's a river boat cruise so the average age is in the 70s.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.880]   A lot of these people, a lot of cable companies are actually giving away, I'm not going to
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.800]   give away a laptop with that so that's where a lot of those things go.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.840]   There's one thing that Jim said that I think is really interesting there though and Tim
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.120]   Cook I believe on the earnings call said that we haven't seen the iPad upgrade cycle yet
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.120]   or at least Apple hasn't seen it.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.400]   They just didn't know what it was, it's a new product, they don't know what it's going
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   to be.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   Absolutely.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.760]   But when you look at the iPhone people upgrade for specific reasons, like a lot of people
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.760]   upgrade because they want a better camera because the iPhone literally is the camera
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.720]   they have with them or they see something like you can play games.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.000]   There's a lot of reasons why they've seen people specifically upgrade an iPhone but
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.440]   when you look at the iPad it's been sold to a lot of people for whom traditional computers
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.080]   are inaccessible or intimidating or otherwise not a few.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:59.160]   Yeah and they don't, like if it is laminated screen on the iPad Air 2, it's meaningless
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.160]   to them.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.280]   There's no point in upgrading but they'll come to a point where that iPad 2 is just too sluggish
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.000]   or the battery dies or something else happens and they love the iPad so they're going to
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   want to get it.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.760]   And yes there will be people for, there are now who use it as a laptop alternative and
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.960]   it'll be even better for them but there'll be all these people who will just, they'll
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.720]   never open slide over, they'll never open split view.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:23.600]   It'll just be another really simple awesome computer that is exactly what they need for
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.440]   their computing and they'll buy the next one and maybe it's a three year cycle, four year
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.440]   cycle.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.440]   I mean Apple makes these things pretty well.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:34.920]   I've got iPad 2's, relatives are still using them wonderfully today.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.760]   Maybe not next year, maybe not the year after and they'll have to buy something new but
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.800]   until we start seeing that, like you said Leo it's a new product we have no idea what
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   the cycle is.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:46.080]   Yeah and that realized that does go both ways too.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:52.520]   Apple sold gangbusters 9.7 inch iPads when all they had in the world were 9.7 inch iPads
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.520]   to sell.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:46:00.960]   And there were no, when there are no color kindles, there were no large size phone tablets.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.120]   I wish we could see more numbers.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:08.240]   I wish Apple could break down what models sell and which proportions because I certainly
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:15.720]   see fewer 9.7 inch iPads in the field as I do iPad minis and I also know from other
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.440]   market research that a lot of people who might have gone for an iPad mini or even a full-sized
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.480]   iPad are now saying well geez now I've got a 5.8 inch 5.9 inch iPad.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   And I'm not sure if I can get a 5.8 inch phone.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.040]   All I wanted was a slightly larger screen so that could read cool stuff on the bus or
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.480]   on the subway in the morning and this big phone seems to address that for me quite
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.480]   adequately.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.760]   So we really don't know when we were another it's possible that we're going to see a huge
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:41.560]   churn of people coming into the who bought iPads three years ago and as soon as they see
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.720]   a new iPad with that one magic new feature they're waiting for everyone rushes in to
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.840]   buy the new one.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:54.040]   Or we could see just as legitimately proof that 9.7 inches was never an ideal size it
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.160]   was never the size the consumers wanted it was just the size that was available and
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.400]   that was built that was that's what built the success of the iPad we just don't know.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:09.000]   I don't I don't think that that's it I think that we there were other sizes available but
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.600]   I think that was the optimum size for the technology that Apple wanted to put in it at
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:20.440]   the time and you know I mean Steve famously said that he didn't want to do a smaller
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:26.760]   iPad but he did and I think a lot of that has to do with the technology that's available
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.240]   and what the market shows after you release a product and you have to be willing to make
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:36.360]   changes like that and it's good that they are it's good that they're not sticking to
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.560]   know we said we'd never do this well.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:44.520]   Time's changed to rumors I like and I hope that they come to an October are
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:51.720]   a pro as you mentioned with this multi touch what are you calling it?
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:57.240]   Not just force touch but also touch sensitive what do you call it?
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.840]   They call that force touch too is all completed.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.800]   It's all for instance.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   The ability to draw it press harder or lighter and have different widths of drawing I don't
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:09.040]   know what you call it there's got to be a word and then I'm liking this new rumor I
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.360]   just saw this week I don't know tell me if it's credible give me a yep or a nope on
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:21.400]   a new iPad mini which I always liked the mini but along the lines of an iPad air too same
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:27.680]   kind of form factor a smaller screen obviously same maybe a maybe even a nine processor in
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.480]   other words a high power little one as well as a high power big one credible.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:40.920]   Oh I think that as Apple continues to to upgrade these they're going to put more power
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:47.680]   into these machines they have to because people are using iPads you know the iPad mini for
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:54.680]   gaming I mean they just put metal support for metal in the iPod touch.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.560]   Yeah that's interesting.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.520]   You know it makes perfect sense.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.200]   But a mini high powered mini would be as a gaming device.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   It would be awesome.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.200]   Oh yeah.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.080]   It got the year before spec so if this year gets the year before spec sets I mean.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.080]   So to get the AA not the A9.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.160]   I mean that's the worst though.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.280]   Will there be an air three?
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.280]   Sure.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   Sure.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.280]   Okay why not.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.280]   Also realize why not.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.400]   I don't even I don't even know why it's it might be an advantage for Apple to even have
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.120]   a CPU difference between the mini and the in the.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.720]   I can't make enough.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.200]   Why have it a year?
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.120]   They couldn't make like last year the the best story I heard is that they couldn't make
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.400]   enough there simply wasn't enough yield on the Apple A processor to get it in the iPhone
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.120]   was massive they had to put almost all of them into the iPhone and they had to make the
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:42.040]   D8X for the iPad to and they just simply wasn't enough capacity to make it for an iPad
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.040]   mini.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.040]   Yeah that makes sense.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.280]   Which is why I took until now to put it.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:53.040]   Pressure sensitive but but is the term I was looking for a pressure sensitive pro.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.400]   And by the way that's unique in and would might be enough I think the reason to try
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.360]   these things to drive people back to the market.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:05.080]   I've got a regular air but I'd like forced touch I'd like pressure sensitivity I'd like
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.080]   a bigger screen.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:10.680]   And unlike waycom it doesn't need an intermediary layer between the screen and the and the digital
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.320]   technology is much it's good technology.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.760]   But it's better than a Cintiq.
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.720]   Yes well it's better technology however the how the implement remains to be seen but
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.680]   theoretically the technology is better.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:25.400]   Realize that realize that Wacom has created a system that has revolutionized digital illustration.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.760]   Everybody has everybody has that technology in their studios even people are just doing
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:31.840]   a little webcomics that they're not really doing that they're not making a whole lot
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.840]   of money out of the monitor with Wacom pressure sensitive.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:40.160]   I mean so it would so Apple Apple would really have to make sure that they're creating a
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.720]   product that they can't they don't they they're not going to be a position of convincing
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.440]   artists that no you don't want that you want this.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.280]   They really are going to have to listen to make sure they give them a tool.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:54.200]   People there are entire blogs about pencils that's how that's how fiddly people are about
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.200]   their creative tools.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:59.520]   I know you know like comic illustrators but some are using surface right Sir Microsoft
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:04.320]   surface surface took even surface one took off gangbusters because they were giving them
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:10.400]   not not not the Wacom technology but similar enough to Wacom technology and a couple of
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.360]   different apps that made it work with it they could just simply be in an airport launch
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.600]   and actually do real work for it.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.480]   So that's that's that's that's another quite big asset.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.560]   I'm more concerned about if Apple puts force I don't I don't think that Apple has really
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.480]   implemented force touch well on the watch yet.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.560]   I still I've been wearing this for two months I still don't instinctively know here's what
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.280]   it means when I force touch something versus here's what it means when I long press something
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:39.720]   and I think that Apple really needs to get that vocabulary down cold before they start
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:44.280]   to complicated by making it expand across the surface of a video and I thought I turned
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.920]   it off on my Mac book because I don't know what the hell's going on.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.840]   But I think that on the Mac book do you know.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.840]   You need to train me.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.960]   Force touch on the watch though is a lot about exploration.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:01.600]   I mean you you go into an app and when I started to first realize that oh I can force touch
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:07.360]   things here I was going into apps of all kinds and just you know force touching on the screen
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.960]   like finding out what it did.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.440]   Yeah it's kind of like that.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.680]   Discover the way to play.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:16.200]   If there's something like in notifications and there's an easy way to get rid of a notification
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:22.940]   you just swipe from from right to left and a box comes up and you can you can clear it.
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.560]   If you force touch it just says clear all.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:31.000]   I mean that's and I didn't know that right off but through trial and error I found all
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.680]   of these different things and it wasn't difficult to find you just press on the screen.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:40.840]   So I okay the way that they describe things yes you know maybe maybe that can be cleared
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:45.840]   up but I think that they did a good job of implementation and really that's what's important
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:50.560]   because I found most of the stuff using it on my own not by reading documentation that
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.960]   Apple released.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:58.000]   I can only speak to my own experience and it's that I also you know you have this great
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.120]   thing about Apple products that you have the sense of play about it that you don't just
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.160]   want to please give me the one feature that I wanted okay great you give me the result
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.600]   I want and I'm done with you.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.880]   You really do want to push all the buttons and twirl all the knobs and figure out what
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:09.880]   things happen.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.240]   The problem is that it's still too much later and I do not instinctively know like if I'm
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.080]   in a brand new app what does a force touch mean versus a long press and there's still
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.280]   times when I'm assuming even with notifications and things like that of course I found out
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.160]   that you force touch and you can do a clear all on a list of notifications but there's
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.200]   still so many times where I think that okay I've got but I'm using the pedometer app I
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.280]   want to take a look at number of steps versus something like something else okay do I tap
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.360]   no okay do I swipe no that is do it do I force touch no force touch does nothing I
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:44.080]   still don't know I feel as though right now I should know instinctively what force touch
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:49.080]   implies in a user interface I would for instance I would have the first thing I would have put
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:56.040]   on the whiteboard is that taps are for manipulating the information that you see force touch
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:01.360]   is to get at settings or get at ways of manipulating the app itself just as an example if that were
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:05.120]   something that were to carry through from app to app to app it would be something that
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:10.000]   I know the vocabulary about this I know what this verb means right now it's it's something
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.240]   that I screw around with eventually after messing with and I with a watch app and if I can remember
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:20.760]   what it does in this one app that will be very very useful like clearing all notifications
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.800]   otherwise it's something that if there's a way to not use it I probably won't discover
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:31.120]   and I probably won't that isn't that isn't that kind of like trying to dictate what a
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:37.160]   preference window does in a in a Mac app you know you can't dictate where where companies
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:41.840]   put things or how they use it but you can put the window there so Apple makes force
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:47.520]   touch available to apps what they choose to implement under the force touch is up to the
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:53.680]   developer I mean if if a developer is doing something really weird in force touch can't
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.800]   be right and say look you know and that's not really what force touch is for shouldn't
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:03.680]   you use it for this instead and and let them figure it out yeah it to me feels more like
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.880]   a right click or it feels more like a hold on the command key while you're selecting
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.760]   something it doesn't feel like here's a window you can do whatever you want with it I could
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:16.520]   be wrong about that but that's just again the of the what what it feels to me like when
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:21.200]   I think about force touch like I said I would just I would love to see that there's some
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.800]   sort of consistency about what I can expect when I long when I when I force touch on something
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.960]   versus long press something there's two things that I thought was really interesting is that
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.760]   one is that I have this ongoing debate with designers about whether fits his law for multi
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.760]   touch is force press that inevitably you'll get angry or excited enough about your screen
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.360]   that you'll force press it and you'll discover things because that's the ultimate extent of
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:45.640]   it's like throwing the mouse but the problem here is that you're really I don't think
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:48.600]   there really should be long press on the watch and there is in things like the color selector
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.280]   on the pallets and that could easily be forced touch anyway I understand why it's not because
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:56.320]   it's a different mechanic but you force press and long press can't really coexist because
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.720]   any force presses but have national long press so just simplify things if they were all you
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:04.480]   know force press and that's another argument but my mom did a review for the Apple Watch
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:11.280]   on Friday and it was fast we said it was on I'm more on Friday and it's amazing because
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:14.680]   she's like the third or fourth person I've interviewed who's just not a techie person
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:19.720]   and just loves the Apple Watch and all of the things that we drive us crazy they don't
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.840]   even notice like I don't know if she does force press I know she doesn't use control
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.640]   center or notification center she loves that it makes her a stand like it encourages her
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.600]   to stand up and she loves that she can make the walking goals all the stuff Jim has written
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:35.320]   about previously and she loves that she gets notifications and phone calls because her
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:39.240]   watch is almost always in her purse or charging and she kept missing those if my sister or
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:44.640]   I would try to call her a texture so it's it does several things so well for her that
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.360]   even it's become a necessary part of her experience but a very simple one she doesn't
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:53.640]   need all these different nuances it's just those basic things are great for her and I
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.920]   wonder if in these discussions about like very minute interface things we're missing a larger
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:02.840]   audience that just wants a couple jobs done yeah I still think that I have a first impression
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:09.060]   back in September that I was prepared to modify as you get more experience that I do
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:14.160]   think that there may be too many control surfaces or maybe too many mechanic or more
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:19.120]   interfaces than are actually required maybe this will change once we see more third party
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:23.400]   developers actually make relapse for it but not only force I think I think I could get
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:28.320]   along very well without without force press at all but the other thing is that I almost
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:33.000]   never use the digital crown as anything other than a clicky button if there I need to scroll
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.760]   something exactly if I need to scroll my instinct is still scroll this way and I've I can't
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:43.220]   I can't think of the top my head of any single interface where my instinct is oh I want to
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:48.540]   adjust that I will use I will do one of these instead so maybe that's again maybe people
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:53.180]   figure out a better ways to use it or there'll be those killer apps that figure out what
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:57.340]   the verb is on that but well you know things like they're changing the complications where
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.820]   you have to spin the selector is the only time I find it really valuable because it's
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:04.260]   really hard to do a tiny little selector yeah changing the complication on your watch
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:10.180]   yeah I think that's the use case for it remember when John Cassissanta and tap tap tap came
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:15.560]   out that allows you to take a picture using the the volume button you know that was huge
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:22.800]   people love that yeah and and then Apple finally adopted that as well but when when they first
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:28.400]   did that it was such a great use of the button because it just made sense and you know further
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:34.700]   to Andy's point I think that people will come up with other uses for the digital crown because
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:41.040]   I'm the same way what I have to scroll through is usually a very short list now I have gone
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:45.820]   into mail and this was during the testing when I was looking at it and it made much more
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:50.360]   sense to scroll using the crown because it was so quick but I don't often go into mail
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:54.640]   on my phone you know I usually just look at the notifications there's four five or six
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:59:00.880]   there and you know a flick with the finger will get me through them yeah it's it's gonna
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:05.600]   be really cool to see I was to see watch OS 2.0 because right now I think we're really
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:10.520]   only getting about 60% of what the watch actually is which is why I always I'm always a little
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:14.600]   bit cautious when I say something when I state an opinion that's based on what I feel is
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:18.360]   an unfinished product right now for instance that there are a lot of there's a lot of stuff
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:24.280]   that I know that there's a watch app for it but I've used that watch app two or three times
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:28.120]   and now my instinct is I'll think I'll just reach my pocket and do this on the phone because
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:32.360]   I know it'll be much more pleasant it'll be much faster and there'll be no delay in communicating
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:38.040]   between these two devices so it's we're only seeing I'm so happy that you I've had the
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:43.840]   same experience as Renee has had that I have an ever note an ever note notebook full of
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.280]   observations about how what the end you not go experience has been with the Apple watch
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:52.800]   but I have to counterbalance that with people who are not necessarily techie people they
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   bought it because it was they thought it was a cool watch and it seems as though they have
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:01.160]   the ability to use as much of it as they want and stay out of the deep end of the pool if
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.560]   that end of the pool scares them or if they there's not adventures enough to go find it
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:09.560]   it's the first product I could think of that Apple's done that doesn't have a universal
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:16.440]   audience a potentially universal audience some people like it oh it's a lot of dependencies
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.120]   it's not a lot of dependencies right now which most of their other products haven't like
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.440]   you could just buy an iPhone you could just buy an iPad true Apple watch you have to have
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.920]   an iPhone 5 or an iPhone 6 class product I think there's people like your mom who love
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.080]   it and there's people like me who I mean I see the value of it I've worked a lot but
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:39.480]   it's like it just doesn't knock me out it it really helped me because you know with Apple
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:46.520]   watch and health kit I've lost you know 45 pounds well that's awesome and I would not
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:55.080]   have done that if it wasn't for health kit and and Apple watch because it's information
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.800]   you know information we've said before information is knowledge and knowledge is power well this
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:06.560]   gave me the information that I needed on how my body reacts to food and how it reacts to
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:13.480]   exercise and what I can do and what I can't do more more what I should do I still you know
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.200]   I'm not fanatical about a diet or anything but I do try and fill the rings on my on my
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:25.440]   watch I try and make sure that I'm eating a bit healthier these days but regardless
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.800]   of what I do in the run of a day it's gonna give me feedback on how I've done the next
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:36.040]   morning if I've gained 10 pounds then okay I shouldn't eat in those four pizzas and and
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:43.280]   doesn't more really you know but if I've if I've lost you know I have a pound or a pound
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.960]   or whatever it is from the day before I can look and say okay well you know I walked for
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:53.960]   three miles yesterday I ate good I did this and it's always there it's always telling me
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:59.600]   something well not to mention your experience because that's fantastic but but but that's
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.640]   what we hear about the Apple watches a lot of these individual anecdotes about how great
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:10.680]   it was for me for this or this but it's not a universal experience I mean it's just some
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.920]   people really dig it like your mom or like Jim and some people that's fine that's fine
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.720]   it's just seems unique in the in the Apple sphere you know what one of the one of the
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:25.000]   themes that might be underlying this show is that Apple sometimes is a victim of its people's
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.760]   own high expectations of it that if there if there isn't an Apple watch and every single
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.080]   risk then it's not a failure but it's not as big a success as it could be it's not the
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:38.160]   cultural phenomenon of introducing a iMac with several colorful colors on it and now
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.880]   George Foreman grills are now aping that industrial design that that was a fluke that was a wonderful
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.280]   fluke but it's it's helping a lot of people and making give them a lot of pleasure and
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.160]   a lot of joy and that's that's good enough and it's also an opportunity to extend the
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:56.600]   conversation that I'm also taking I'm taking a wider look into fitness bands and I'm to
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   the my band du jour is the Garmin Vivo smart where it's not as good as an Apple watch but
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.640]   it's $120 it will also have notifications on your wrist it will also track your steps
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.440]   it will also tell you hey you you've not got you've been sitting too long get up and walk
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.240]   around and I'll tell you when it's okay to sit back down again and it's more approachable
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.840]   to a great number of people like like I mean it's just like Jim said when you have numbers
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.120]   in front of you it's a lot easier to figure out where your problems are and what you need
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.880]   to address and what you need to fix I do think that the the watch telling me I was I was I
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:39.620]   was driving two days I was driving two days ago and and I had to say really watch you're
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:45.480]   telling me to stop the car get out of the car and walk for tickets you can't figure out
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:50.200]   that I'm driving right now but nonetheless it it's great to have that data about here
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.760]   is the days you were active and not active even if it's even if it's just through your
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.720]   phone even if you're just going to that little pain on Google services that lets you take
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.040]   a look at all the data that's collected on you and you can see here are the days that
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.120]   you were very very active here's the days that you left the house here is here's two
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.600]   days in a row you did not leave the house is there something you know you maybe you
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.400]   want to check out why you didn't leave the house for two days last week it's it's all
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.640]   data and it's all helpful coming up movie time we're going to watch some some flicks

[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:06.160]   we're gonna make some history together today steve jobs had one speed full on I saw my first
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.040]   computer when I was 12 I was so fascinated by this time magazine says single handily created
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.080]   the industry working in this garage steve jobs and steve wozniak built the first apple computer
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:23.040]   board it was the magic we could influence the world hello I am back in touch he wanted to
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.880]   have a foot in both worlds he wanted to be the renegade but he also wanted to be legit
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:34.960]   this is a 21st century bicycle he was on a mission can we help you express yourself in richer ways
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:40.640]   he made the eye map can you see it he made the eye pop he made the eye foam and that's awesome
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:48.240]   he's made everything stuff was beloved but it wasn't that he was the loved he was paid 7 000
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.800]   told me we were paid 700 and wrote me a check for 350 and that hurts because we were friends
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:57.920]   steve did create reality distortion around him he could convince people to do something they
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:03.760]   thought was impossible her work was intense the commitment needed to do it was intense I lost
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:10.080]   my wife I lost my children he says if you choose to leave my family I will personally take you down
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:16.080]   this is a story that's amazing it's got theft stolen property extortion there's sex in there
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:23.840]   who knows he's the father somebody should make a movie out of this creativity is a
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:31.520]   what about anarchy he was a study in contrast beautiful haunting brilliant he was not that much fun
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:38.320]   most of the time but there are those moments when suddenly he's the only person who could ever
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:44.000]   not even the minute that you understand that you can poke life that you can change it you
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:51.920]   can mold it you'll never be the same again what makes you want to see it what would you say about
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:10:02.880]   the responsibilities of power power what is that what do you think has anybody have you seen it
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:09.040]   anybody seen it no I premiered at uh thought by Southwest doesn't it yeah yeah I haven't seen
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:16.400]   it I like I like the trailer only because when I've you we've seen too many steve jobs projects
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:24.000]   that seem to want to make him out of marble and reduce him to archetype as opposed to a human being
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.440]   we're all familiar both the stories we've read stories we've been told by people that we can
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.200]   share and stories we've been told by people that we can't share that Steve was a very complex
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:42.560]   individual but that's definition of a human being so if they if if the hagiography has been put aside
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.720]   to say let's have an honest talk about all the things that made him great and all these things
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:52.160]   that made him somewhat less than ideal person to work with I think that's a very very positive
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:58.560]   thing for the for history Jim I Renee have you seen it I haven't I haven't seen it but
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:07.840]   I have a deep respect for for Steve not just for the products that he made and the way that he changed
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:17.040]   the world with those products and with apple but for for the way that he stood up for what he believed
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:25.120]   in um you know when he came back to apple and he he said the word we're gonna change it things by
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:34.240]   design and he did he the apple literally changed industries and and multiple industries some companies
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:40.880]   do that once in a company's history they've done it multiple times and you know he may have been
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:48.080]   difficult to get along with he um may have been harsh I respect him respect him for all of it
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:56.960]   agree I mean adak adak matter about any one of us yeah there are things we really love to suppress
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:03.760]   with fire I think I will say I'll I'll I'll run a speak but I just wanted to add to what I said
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:10.080]   earlier that I'm more pleased with seeing a documentary with we're seeing his own face and his own
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.120]   words and we're talking the thing the thing is we're we don't need to talk about fictional
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.840]   versions of Steve Jobs yet there's still world filled with people who knew him personally and
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.960]   work with them and have their own perspectives but their perspectives inform from working side by
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.520]   side with them for years and years and years that's why of all the Steve Jobs movies proposed and
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.280]   actually discussed for release this is the one I'm probably most interested in actually saying
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:39.200]   you agree Renee I love two minds on this kind of stuff because documentaries much like reality
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:45.440]   TV are storytelling so we can never get a show is in the agenda but yeah yeah absolutely and if
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.040]   you don't know it you know it's one thing if you do know it and you agree with it or disagree with
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:54.960]   it it's another I'm lucky enough to have spoken to a lot of people um and who had very dear memories
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.240]   of Steve Jobs who don't want to see any of these movies because they're afraid that they'll
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.800]   taint the memories that they do have both good and bad because it just it won't be their experience
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.600]   and I can really understand that so I I'm kind of happy that the industry gets this kind of
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:12.480]   attention that Steve Jobs is an important enough person that we have multiple movies being made
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.800]   and to Jim's point I mean the music industry picks are all these different ways that what that
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.760]   what he put his mind to affect our lives but at the end I think I'm just going to get Steve Jobs fatigue
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:28.400]   is there anything more to say about Steve I mean is there is there other and then is there an
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:33.360]   anecdote we haven't heard video we haven't seen I think it's like to the point where I just read
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.000]   um like even now people still bring out the what would Steve Jobs do thing in articles about Apple
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.440]   and it's done to the point where I just find that exhausting yeah yeah but I and it's inaccurate too
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.880]   when when people do that when they bring out because we don't know what Steve would have done
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:54.160]   nobody knows what Steve would have done because he changed his mind yes yeah a lot too you know
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.400]   we brought up a point earlier about the iPad mini where he said he was never going to do it
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:06.240]   I tried on Windows yeah I tuned so I mean Steve did a lot of things based on here and now so if anybody
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:11.040]   says I mean there was one story I remember just a while ago where we're a writer at the Guardian
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:16.560]   said that Steve Jobs never would have released a watch well Steve did release a watch he released
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.920]   several of them and we're all old enough to remember that but you know the fact is nobody can
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:32.640]   realistically say that and mean it yeah because Steve himself reversed position so many times yeah
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:38.320]   well let's see that's that's again I I would kind of be even just as happy if there weren't any
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:44.000]   documentaries about him for another 10 years that takes a while for perspective to really seep in
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.360]   but I also it's also in the first five or ten years after a great person's death a lot of this
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.000]   stuff becomes entrenched and really really hard to shift in the public imagination I think one of
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.880]   the least well reported parts of Apple history was is the fact that the other times where Steve
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:07.280]   Jobs is very bullheaded and someone he part of why part of why he was such a good CEO is that he
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.000]   hired people who were not afraid to say okay Steve you're wrong here's we're going to keep on you
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.640]   about this because this is going to be important and eventually he would see
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:22.320]   the what was proven to be the correct way and but unfortunately a lot of the dialogue is well
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.560]   because he saw the idea on the tree he plucked it right and he stuck it right in his pocket and
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.840]   we're all the better he's going to be Sir Isaac Newton eventually there's nothing you could do
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:39.200]   about it but we lived in his time and I don't know I can't get enough of it and I agree with you
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.560]   I just love I love this stuff even though I've heard every story I think by now
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.520]   I loved reading becoming Steve Jobs and at the end it is funeral when they talk about the funeral
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.800]   I got all teary again you know there's we've been we were I think look he's not
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:58.640]   we were lucky to live in a time that included Steve Jobs I mean I think that's the case and there's
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.480]   some others I put in that statement Elon Musk there's others but we were very lucky to live in a time
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:11.280]   when he was alive and and to get to benefit from his genius I'm glad I didn't have to work for him
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:16.960]   I don't know if I'd survived that but there probably people say that about me too
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:23.760]   not the first part the second part we do know one thing at least according to a article in medium
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:32.080]   Steve did not like a Sikh pod the creator of Sikh pod Kazi and Frank's wrote a article
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:38.880]   how Apple influenced the labels to shut down my music streaming startup you may remember Sikh
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:47.680]   pod S E E Q P O D it goes back to the earliest days of the the iPod 50 million active users every
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:53.360]   month 250 million searches every month of course the searches you were making for songs often turned
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:59.600]   up pirated versions of those songs Warner music ended up suing and putting a Sikh pod out of business
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:06.640]   according to this story Warner told a Sikh pods founder that uh Steve Jobs suggested
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.280]   recommended that they put Sikh pod out of business
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:18.240]   it was a different time yeah well also Sikh pod was already
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.600]   they were really dancing on that line yeah because kind of like group shark right
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:30.480]   well people people were not using that service to find public domain jazz record from 1903
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:36.080]   they were doing it to find copyrighted music that they didn't have to pay for right so it might so
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:42.640]   I don't I don't know I don't know anything about apples or Steve Jobs involvement in this but
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.560]   it's not as though he was a rich vibrant thing who was going to transform the industry that was
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.440]   certainly going to sail right along for interference it's no they're they're going to have a they're
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:56.720]   going to have some problems before they got to success apple currently in under investigation
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:05.840]   by the FTC music streaming services have been hit with subpoenas the feds are looking at apples
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:16.960]   share 30% share of music sales I don't understand why that's an issue I do I do see that people
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.840]   like spotify might be irritated by apple trying to kill their free streaming tier and that's
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:28.640]   that was the initial investigation yeah to me that's what a lot of this came down to was
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.040]   you know trying to kill that free streaming but
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:40.160]   it makes sense that that apple would want that done but you know also
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:45.680]   that's maybe what the government is saying that's not really cool you know you can't really do
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.680]   stuff like that so I don't know how much trouble they would get in for something like that for
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:58.000]   making a suggestion that why don't you get rid of a a free tier and put everybody on the same level
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:06.720]   don't know but yeah the issue I guess is that spotify rdio rhapsody title uh normally charge 10
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:14.800]   bucks a month for subscriptions but when they're on iOS they need to make up the lost revenue so
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.040]   they charge 30 more there's no room for two middlemen so if you have an agreement with the labels
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.200]   middlemen you have to give them a portion of that money apple is the only middleman when it comes to
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.520]   iTunes music so they just give their 30 percent but when you have two middlemen it's sort of like
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:32.000]   if you sell a product at walmart typical retail deals are around 55 percent walmart keeps a
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.200]   majority of of the money but if you had a second reseller inside walmart you would get even less
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.360]   of that money and then you would complain saying hey it's not fair but that's that's the way middlemen
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.200]   worked it's very hard to have a relationship with those multiple people that's why i can't for instance
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:51.760]   by audiobooks within the audible app on i on the iphone but i can within the audible app on
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:57.040]   uh android because you know google doesn't take 30 percent but apple will if you buy their business
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:03.680]   models very different than apples yeah um so but is that uh anti-competitive i mean i guess
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:10.960]   everybody wants to be on the iphone in a way that's the success of the iphone well i mean i think
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:16.720]   that the reason that they're just investigating at this point is to see if it was going to be
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:20.160]   any competitive i don't think that they've really made up their mind no they haven't was
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:27.280]   or no that's right so you know depending on how those discussions go you know they could slap apple
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:34.560]   with something but that's going to be a prolonged court case regardless if they decide to do something
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:40.560]   but you know nothing ever happened so they really don't have that competitive advantage
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:47.360]   that they're trying to investigate so they're investigating them talking about it i guess
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:55.120]   yeah it's it's weird i mean the 30 percent markup of that the 36 the 30 percent apple tax
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:00.480]   apple charges it's i don't think apple apple apple doesn't need to get rid of it but it's always
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:05.520]   going to create complications to me the big one is that it's just so complicated to buy anything
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.760]   through the app store unless you're dealing with a company that's already making like an 80
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.240]   markup and they can afford to give away 30 percent of their profits it still bumps me out that you
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:19.360]   every Wednesday i have to go to comixology.com make my purchases on a webpage and then come back
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:23.840]   in when it when i'm when i'm using a windows device when i'm using an android device it's
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:30.000]   almost it's almost like off-putting like you know 2001 when the ape like looks at that bones they
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.720]   wait a minute i can make an in-app purchase within the app i don't have to i don't have to leave and
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:42.960]   go to the web all they do you all they do you so i so what if apple what if the fdc said apple look
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:47.680]   you can't do it it's going to be super interesting because i apple apple does apple's way said they
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.440]   run the app store to slight profit now they run it at a bigger profit but apple doesn't want to run
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:55.680]   it at a loss and that's why they're careful about the 30 percent thing is just broad and there are
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.400]   some concessions on the apple tv but mostly it's just 30 percent because that way you can make a free
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.200]   app and put it in an app purchase you can make a free app and have web downloads but if those things
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:09.360]   had less than 30 percent very few people would be stupid enough to actually make a premium
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:13.600]   app anymore they would just take the money in the economy outside of the app store and then apple
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:18.320]   would be providing the platform and all the distribution channels for an app that they made no money off
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:23.600]   of it almost everything that could would just go free with transactions being held elsewhere and
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.520]   then that's not that's not a sustainable model for apple like yes they're an incredibly rich company
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.720]   and they could pay for it out of the prop they could subsidize it with hardware profits or
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:35.120]   something else yeah but they they wanted to operate at cost and that means that any app that does
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.320]   make money is helping support the entire ecosystem including apps that are free
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:46.080]   I don't know if that's exactly what would happen any any any company that has to make money is
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.920]   trying to is going to be making money outside of apple anyway so apple is already not seeing
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:54.160]   a penny off of my console purchases and i just i just hope it's something that apple continues
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:58.800]   to look at when it comes to how can they make the experience better for users because that's
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:04.000]   there are principles that guide and inform every single decision apple makes and sometimes they
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.120]   listen to that loud more loudly than they than on some things than others but it's always is
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:13.600]   there a way we can make this easier for consumers and having to leave an app in order to make a
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.080]   purchase is leave a reader app to make a purchase then go back into the reader app to enjoy that
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:23.120]   purchase that kind of sucks for users right i hope they come back to that that that choice later on
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.160]   i hope they make an exception because right now digital goods are accepted for example if
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:30.320]   there's an amazon app and you order a book like i know they don't take 30% of that no they don't
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.840]   and there could be an argument and it's looking like they're doing this for apple tv and hopefully
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:37.840]   it'll propagate where they come to an arrangement where if you're selling a digital good maybe it's
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.720]   not 30% anymore maybe it's 5% or 10% especially if you're doing your own fulfillment and then
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.920]   there there maybe would be room for multiple middlemen and it wouldn't be an all or nothing
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.120]   deal for anybody i understand why apple would need to make money if they use bandwidth
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:56.400]   but they require if you're using uh the in app purchases uh on the iphone we're gonna we're
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:01.120]   gonna get 30% of that and then but then they have some exceptions so it's very nice i mean if they
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.960]   were another way where they can say well what if we we're we're you're not using it we're not we're
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.440]   not using apple we're not going to be using apple services to deliver the content we're
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:13.680]   still going to be serving it from our own from our own paycheck we can we just charge you a
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:18.400]   transaction fee just for the transaction do they for handling access to the itunes store there you
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.000]   go i'll give you a nick and the and the platform trust that comes with it which is valuable for
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.680]   people well uh i don't know how you feel about magenta but t-mobile is definitely doing something
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:35.920]   that will make uh iphone users on t-mobile happy they are not going to charge you for bandwidth you
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:43.280]   use 3g or lte bandwidth you use to listen to apple music um so that's kind of cool yeah
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:47.920]   isn't it's like neutrality craziness it does have it sound a little like it's a net neutrality issue
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:53.120]   but uh okay as long as apple not giving the money to do that if they're just saying hey this is good
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:59.920]   for us that's different right then it's not net neutrality well it's also a sign of how competitive
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.080]   carriers have become now you're not no one feels as though they're locked in anything i went back in
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:09.280]   when i when i went into uh reprovision re-provision my android sim card so i was switching back to
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:15.600]   the iphone for my uh for my apple watch testing it was the first time that i'd really like re-looked
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:20.000]   at my uh bandwidth plans and so i took that time and say well let's take a look at everything that
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.040]   i'm doing right now and it was like in the in the three years since i'd signed up for my plan i was
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:29.120]   able to cut like three times more bandwidth for the same amount of money i was able to get a better
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:34.080]   deal on tech so i was gonna get a better better deal and everything else because that's exactly how
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.080]   and all without having to sign up for for an extended contract and that's how competitive
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.040]   things have gotten i think we're gonna see more stuff like this where uh maybe fall far far short
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:49.040]   of a company giving you free netflix streaming over over broadcast right uh but i mean it's it's
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:54.080]   so it's so inexpensive to get it's so inexpensive to give access to google music or to amazon streaming
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.840]   music that it's like we'll just give that to you this is what i wanted competition we didn't want
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:03.280]   you know carriers to merge and we wanted the you know four carriers and the weaker carriers have
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.680]   to compete harder they're actually i didn't realize this but there are 33 services that stream free
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:14.560]   on t-mobile apple music is just the newest of them and and we're saying and apple uses are
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:20.240]   becoming are benefiting from the the proliferation of really cheap unlocked carrier free android
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:25.280]   phones that are starting to scare the carriers a lot even in the united states because now even
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.440]   just this morning mo to roll announced a really good hundred seventy nine dollar new version of
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:34.240]   the mo to g that is going to address the needs of about eighty five to ninety percent of people
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.280]   who use a mobile phone and it's hundred seventy nine bucks you own it and on at the drop of a hat
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:44.480]   if you want to if you don't like if you don't like who they hired for their uh for for their uh uh
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:50.080]   for AT&T ads this month you said i don't want to ever see i i i don't i didn't like that guy's last
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.640]   movie i'm gonna switch to sprint i'm gonna switch to t-mobile just on that basis you can do that now
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:00.080]   uh and so it's so it's it's the sort of thing that really improves things for everybody even
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.800]   i phone users he didn't say in this blog post i'm not clear if android phones get the free
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:09.360]   it's first is the nordeaks and then it's us so yeah because as soon as you have so only phone right
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.680]   i guess that's his garbage to me that's that's the third rail of any conversation with rene
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:19.840]   although you can it canadians over here so it's it's part of a cut like if you
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.840]   it sounds funny because a lot of people in america say well we have this and this and this and you
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:28.080]   have so many consumer choices and you come outside american it i can't even get an amazon echo or
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.160]   amazon mp3 so you know you're some of the products that you guys think it's not very good i'm switching
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:38.080]   this i i can't even do that here's what you can stream free like we like you so we're not supposed
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.640]   to tell you this so everybody else who's not outside the conversation turn off your speakers but
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:49.200]   see we're trying to lure really cool tech people like yourself to the united states if we're
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:55.520]   working with jim moving in next to jim hey by the way it's not just to apple music i'm looking at the
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:02.640]   list of 33 years services it includes google music yeah rdio songs uh slackers spotify
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.720]   rhapsody i heart radio pandaure i didn't know this and i'm an i'm a t-mobile customer that's a that's
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:14.720]   a big list and this so this doesn't cost there also uh and maybe this is maybe this is the uh
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:19.280]   tit for tat that apple is getting for them uh t-mobile is going to let you upgrade for free if
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:25.520]   you buy an iphone six today through t-mobile uh you'll get whatever the next iphone is
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:32.560]   free just swap it that's the other interesting part about all this now now that 18t and all the
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:37.360]   other major carriers have stopped uh using language like oh this is a hundred ninety nine
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:43.040]   dollar phone and of course you understand that you're gonna be you will get the money back uh from
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.320]   all the services that we're going to sell you over the course with to your contract now they're
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.720]   explicitly saying no this is a six hundred ninety nine dollar phone and we'll just simply charge you
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:56.240]   on installments uh month after month after month it's harder for people to not understand how much
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.480]   they're how much they're paying for each phone and once you once you start telling them here is a
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:04.560]   six hundred fifty dollar phone versus here is a hundred and seventy nine dollar phone i don't think
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:09.120]   i'm not sure if it's enough to get someone to switch from ios to android but if you get someone who is
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.600]   largely indifferent who just wants a phone it just cares about do i get spotify yes do i get my book
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:18.320]   reader yes do i get access to these uh to to to facebook messenger yes okay then i'm good
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:24.240]   it's gonna be it's i'm interested to see if apple ever finds a need to address that or if
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.640]   they are the premium brand that people will pay extra for and they don't care that it's a that's
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.800]   a four hundred dollar more for this phone they're also going to jump you ahead of the line on the
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:39.040]   next generation iphone he says uh this john ledger's ceo of team mobile there's a new iphone this year
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.680]   oh your first in line when you order your upgrade during the first 48 hours it's available we'll
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:48.480]   give you order priority and ship it first along with others who qualify for priority access
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:54.160]   so uh and and they're doing if you get a 16 gig iPhone 6 it's 15 dollars a month
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:58.640]   amortized or forever i don't know is the only one with slugs in his blog post as colorful as jim's
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:04.880]   they're very magenta jim jim doesn't use magenta nobody uses similar language
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:12.080]   what am i missing what other stories do we have in the uh rundown let me uh let me just
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:19.280]   oh the uh beta five el capitan yep came out anything new or exciting in there better
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:25.920]   better better we're we're on target for what when's that gonna come out fall over october yeah
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:32.000]   if they follow the same pattern they follow the last and ios 9 will come out in october or no when
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.840]   the new iphone september yeah September yeah okay the other the cool thing worth mentioning is that
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:42.000]   apple has listened to a lot of people and said okay guess what if you're running a beta on ios you
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.800]   can't leave app store reviews for anything yes that's great yes you can still leave the
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.480]   time which is coming yeah grow up you can still leave star ratings which is a little bit annoying
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:53.600]   but they got rid of the reviews at least hopefully they they close that as well yeah
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:31:01.680]   this is the one star as it hurts them i have a counter phone i phone uh six and six plus from china
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:07.600]   i bet you it came from that factory that the chinese police for some reason shut down it's
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.520]   been going on for years i had to ping yesterday i had to ping jim yesterday and explain to him that
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:18.800]   it wasn't the galaxy s six factory took me about two minutes to make that yeah it's called samseung
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:24.640]   oh no no um 41 shock to learn the counterfeit apple phones are being manufactured here
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:32.640]   i i shot cap that shot uh 41 000 fake iPhones worth as much as 19 million dollars they've arrested
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:37.920]   nine suspects i don't know what happened uh i thought they'd paid everybody off but apparently
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:42.480]   not yeah that there's an interesting story behind that one because yeah paid off until you're not
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:50.000]   more yeah yeah yeah so i i should actually it's in my drawer but i have the only the funny thing is
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:56.320]   these these these counterfeits look very very real um but uh when you and when you boot them up they
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:01.920]   look like they're running ios until you hit the app store and then it's google yeah play chinese
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:06.080]   that i think it's a chinese app and i know it's cool well maybe because of me i don't know okay
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:10.480]   well sometimes i've seen ones that uh are essentially android i've seen ones that run something that's
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:14.880]   weird that i haven't seen but you go get mine i'll be holding it holding it in your hand i've seen i've
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.120]   seen i've seen i phone sixes where you hold it in your hand and you just don't know what you're holding
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:24.560]   and even when you fire it up the screen is really really good you have to drill at least a level
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:29.920]   down into the user interface before you start seeing you know clinics it costs it costs apple
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.920]   billions of dollars to make the first one but after that it's not that expensive to make the
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:40.160]   same manufacturing processes in china again so it's for for a lot of people it's a fashion brand you
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:44.560]   just want to have that you just want to have a device that has that logo on it uh just like a
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:48.640]   lot of people don't care if they have an eus saying the wrong bag they just want a bag that has eus
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:55.520]   and the wrong logo's on it so even and i'm not even i would have when i was when i was in china i
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.280]   actually wanted to buy it i will never pronounce this name correctly tag hauer h a u e r i promised
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.800]   it once and someone told me i was pronouncing it wrong so this is canonically pronounced wrong i
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:10.480]   would have proudly like told people this is my fake my fake tag watch that i that i bought for
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:15.200]   sixty three dollars and it's a knockoff of the thousand dollar one not because i want to fake
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:18.720]   people into thinking they've got the real thing but because hey look look at me i've got the thing
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:22.480]   that really looks cool in your wrist one of my earliest memories from being in hong kong as a kid
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:26.160]   is buying my jeans in one store and then buying whatever label i wanted in the store next door yes
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:30.880]   that's how it works so here's yeah this is the iphone six
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:40.240]   even so uh the guy who brought me this from china uh said he paid i think 111 dollars for it
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:44.800]   it's not i can't it's not charged up and by the way it holds a charge for about five minutes
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.680]   and he said but it doesn't say iphone uh at first you have to bring it across the street and then they
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:59.040]   uh then they paint iphone iphone on it um this is what a five you can also get a banana logo if
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:05.680]   you want to pay my best and then uh i think this is a ga a fake galaxy yeah and then here's this is
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:12.640]   the funniest one this is a fake windows phone but on the back it says android so
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:18.000]   but it does say 41 megapixel which i know it was curious probably not true
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:25.440]   4.6 megapixel that's a very odd phenomena that's like getting a knockoff Emerson stereo receiver
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:32.800]   me getting a knockoff Samsung yeah knockoff of a knockoff actually this might be a real
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:40.080]   Samsung i don't i can't remember wow i thought it's aligned Leo just check with that it's hard
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:46.000]   to tell yeah i think that actually is a note three but anyway they're all in the same drawer
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.280]   but that one's pretty impressive uh if you hold it in the same hand as your iphone six it's pretty
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:58.560]   hard to tell the difference except that it's android my watch just told me it's time to stand up stand
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:03.360]   up Jim we're gonna take a break when you sit down if you have a pick or a tip you'd like to pass
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:07.680]   along to our fine audience we'll give you a chance to do that we're gonna wrap things up here in
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:14.000]   just a second our show today brought to you by wealth front we have many sponsors most oh
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:20.960]   everybody's standing up it's a 1250 right oh why is it that they don't stagger that there's no
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.480]   intelligence applied at all yet there's none i mean you could be standing up and i'll tell you
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.080]   to stand up you could be in a car you could well it's not so it's mislabeled it doesn't want you
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:32.400]   to stand it wants you to move so that i should that should actually be called move move should be
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.240]   called exercise next i should be called burn or something yeah need to shift all those labels across
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.840]   it's funny i mean i've got two people in the audience are standing up
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:45.440]   it i wonder if like at conferences and events now if at 10 minutes to the hour every hour people
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:49.920]   just stand up and start moving around i don't know we should do this from now on on all of our shows
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.240]   it happened wc keynote all of a sudden a bunch of us got yeah that the alarm went off and we're
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:58.000]   just looking at it oh that's so funny we thought they'd make a gag out of it and say okay everyone
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.520]   here's your time stand up for a minute now we're gonna go back that's so funny our show today brought
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:09.920]   to you by wealth front the company that i cannot do to SEC regulations use almost all of our
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:14.960]   advertisers i am a customer not wealth front although i will be the minute they stop advertising
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:20.800]   this is such a great idea everybody knows that you should be investing at least some of your
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:27.360]   savings for long-term for you and your family's financial health a rainy day retirement chances
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.560]   are a lot of people go to an advisor and investment advisor is going to charge you as much as one
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:37.600]   to three percent of what you've got under management and then there's additional fees for transactions
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.800]   and changes i know i've experienced this personally wealth front doesn't do that it's uh it's
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:48.480]   computerized it's uh it's amazing it makes it easy for anyone to get world-class long-term
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:53.200]   investment management you could set it up in minutes you'll use their software to monitor your
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:58.320]   portfolios around the clock wealth front will do this trading based one of the managers is the
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:03.200]   guy wrote that what random walkdown wall street which is one of my bibles it's brilliant but it
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:09.040]   does it all for you you don't have to do it uh which is awesome awesome plus they do some pretty
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:15.360]   sophisticated stuff like tax loss harvesting and direct indexing which optimize your after
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.080]   tax returns and lower your tax bill i mean this is really clever transparent and accessible you
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.080]   can see all your accounts in one place you can have personal you can have joint you can have
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:29.040]   retirement you can see every trade they make on your behalf remember this is long-term it's not
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:37.440]   day trading the idea is to build your wealth every month every year you pay and this is the best part
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:43.680]   one quarter of one percent per year 25 basis points and there are no commissions there are
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.880]   no hidden charges i'm talking less than five bucks a month to invest thirty thousand dollars
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:54.800]   and you can just try it if you want because they've lowered the minimum to set up an account to 500
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:02.640]   bucks they've grown 20 times with that 2 000 over the last two years now two two point four
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:06.640]   billion dollars being managed by wealth front because it's a brilliant idea it's kind of the

[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:25.360]   wealthfront.com to read their full disclosure wealthfront.com/macbreak it's a pick of the week
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:32.880]   time let's start with rene richie today so uh this is an app that's been around for a while but and
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.520]   i sort of been vaguely aware of it but i saw john august who makes the app um john august he wrote
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:42.640]   you read a lot of hollywood movies like big fish and um charlie's angel things like that and he's
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.400]   also develops ios apps and he makes some really good ones wow and this one is sort of one of the
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:51.360]   smaller apps that he makes but it's called weekend read and it's exactly what the name implies every
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.000]   it comes with some content some scripts mainly and every weekend he makes new scripts available
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.960]   and last weekend it was the social network script by erin sorghain oh that's good i've read that yeah
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:06.560]   yeah the minute i saw that it was just easy buy easy download and every week you'll tweet out
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:11.120]   and see inside the app it is great because the weekend is it really is sort of like the problem
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.920]   you're solving on the weekend is boredom it's the weekend you have some time you want something
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:17.680]   interesting to read you don't care about the 19th recycling of the same tech story you want
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.800]   something different maybe a little bit artistic and this just it has a great diversity great content
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.680]   i love reading scripts he always picks really good selections and it's just it's something
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:32.080]   that i look forward to now every friday so um it's available on the app store it's a couple bucks
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.600]   well well well worth it and he john august again picks great scripts every great great idea i
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.160]   mean if you're into movies and if you're a film buff reading the scripts is great by the way they
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:47.680]   have iphone and ipad version so that's nice universal binary and how much of the scripts
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:52.080]   this is all free so as long as you've bought the app what as long as you're paying attention
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:56.080]   again so they come in on friday i believe they leave sunday night so you have to pay attention
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:02.400]   to get them on the weekend literally it is a weekend read oh i get it yeah that's neat so uh
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:07.680]   1199 for weekend read unlimited and that's you pay that once and that's it it's free to download
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:13.360]   and try love it good yeah i enjoyed i enjoyed reading the weekend scripts this week it was great
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:19.920]   jimmy got us up a pick or something you'd like to share with us i do i i would like to share
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:25.120]   an app that i've been using for the last year and helping with my fitness and weight loss called
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:32.400]   my fitness pal love it yes i use it too love it it's a great app just uh you can search food
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:41.120]   um you can use a upc label scanner uh the camera on your iphone and again it's it's not
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:48.560]   something that you have to be religious about but it's information the more information you have
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:56.480]   the better decisions you can make or you know you can choose to ignore it whenever i do bad
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.720]   things like you you know more than i should or drink more than i should i still put it all in
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:05.600]   there i think that's a good idea just to track it yep and it's great for doing that it also
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:10.720]   track exercise and it's got a social component yeah i don't use the social component oh i was
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:16.480]   gonna say what's your handle i'd like to follow you i've got dr mom who is in our chat room follows me
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:21.360]   she's my on online doctor so she'll she'll give me pads in the back or berate me
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.960]   maybe that's maybe i shouldn't use this social component
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:30.640]   no i love this app lisa it was impressive lisa went on the you know we went on a cruise a couple
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:37.440]   of weeks ago uh two week uh cruise and lisa wrote everything down the whole time she was
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.560]   amazing she lost four pounds on the cruise i could kill her i gained four pounds on the cruise
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:48.240]   so yeah my fitness pal it's great it's owned by under armor it's it's free right jim i think it is yeah
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:55.280]   yeah there is a a new i did the pro level paid component for the pro but yeah the the basis of it
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:43:02.000]   is all free yeah very nice stuff i don't know if any of you use the command line but i think this
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:09.120]   is a very geeky tip the terminal the terminal uh let me open up my terminal because i have uh installed
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:17.520]   now the default terminal on um uh os 10 like a bunto and a lot of other uh unix like uh operating
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:25.280]   systems is bash the born-again shell but it's very unixy and it's in its configuration and all of that
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:31.040]   there's a new one that i really like called fish which stands for the friendly interactive
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:38.000]   shell let me uh let me go to the fish uh web page here by the way there's a loop insight that's a
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.080]   good recommendation such a great site great site even with the purple
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:54.400]   just just Samuel Jackson and Jim Dalrym let me do fish look for the comis fish command line shell
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:00.000]   it's at fish shell dot com it's you know i mean if you're used to bash you'll be fairly comfortable
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.320]   with a lot of the uh you know if you use the command line it's not going to blow you away but
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:11.520]   it does some stuff like uh things like uh coloring syntax it does great auto suggestions so it kind
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:16.320]   of knows what you're not love what they say the command line shell for the 90s but that's because
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:24.000]   most shell shells are really for the 70s go back a few um i really like it as a function command
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:30.720]   that uh prompts are programmable by function um it's some really impressive stuff man page
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:35.360]   completions mean it's easy to find out what the commands are it does run on windows and
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:40.320]   linux but if you're an os 10 user you can install it in three ways there's a standalone app so if
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:45.040]   you don't want to kind of mess with your own you know your setup you can just run the standalone
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.120]   app and it's a terminal program and you can run the shell and see how you like it you can also
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.960]   install it into a use of local or if you're a brew user humbrew has a very simple command line
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:00.880]   brew install fish once you install it uh it's friendly it's easy it's got a great help command
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:07.200]   and you see as soon as i start typing it suggests uh commands it's really a great way to get into
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:13.360]   uh the command line very easy to customize the prompt as well uh you know i know this is a kind
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:16.720]   of a geeky recommendation but i've been using it for a couple of months now and i really like it
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:26.480]   fish shell free fish shell dot uh common if you do if you do do uh uh shell scripting i think you'll
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:31.840]   really like the features uh in uh fish and the end of the video sorry i don't know if we mentioned it
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:35.440]   that reminds me i don't know if we mentioned it but coda frios came out which is also geek yes
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.320]   from a elite wonderful used to be coda what it was coda dia coda on the dia coda yeah
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:46.960]   panicked as great software and coda is a if you do uh webcoding of any kind it's great love that
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:53.120]   that's such a that's such a great example of the i i want to be able to do all my work on an ipad
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.920]   and if you are if you're if you're a web manager if you're a web designer that's like i've got
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:03.280]   this app it's even better than many of the tools that are on the desktop it's a great app i'm sorry
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:09.440]   i'm sorry we lost one of the greatest app names in app storage coda but but still
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:16.960]   andy what do you got i've got one of those contemplative sort of like meditational games
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:23.760]   puzzle games it's called prune and it's got the simplest premise where at the bottom of the ground
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:29.040]   there is a tree that is growing and it's growing towards the light as it grows you need to by using
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:33.840]   a fruit ninja sort of swipe cutaway branches that are preventing it from reaching the light
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:41.040]   and so it's simple premise but it gets so so interesting to to manipulate it and sometimes
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.680]   there are things that are throwing shade that you have to sort of convince it to grow around and
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:50.400]   once the branches start to find the sunlight flowers start to appear and now you can sort of get
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:55.520]   it to grow towards these little like energy sort of things and make it grow even better
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:02.000]   but as you can see from this graphics it's just you almost are okay with just leaving that streaming
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.600]   to your apple tv as a screensaver because it's just beautiful graphic design
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:13.760]   and even though it is it is a game and there is it keeps growing and growing and growing whether
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:18.880]   you want it to stop or not you never i never get into that situation where i feel myself getting
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:24.400]   more panicked and more you know keyed up i play games to relax as a because i got enough stress
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:30.080]   in my work life that i don't want to go get the get the get the medpack oh god that
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.160]   so this is one of the things that i can relax i can let i can be a vessel of
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:41.920]   vessel of peace and love as i'm as i'm encouraging lively things to grow
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:47.360]   another thing i like about it is that it's $3.99 so the they're actually charging money
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:52.000]   commensurate with the amount of effort they put into it i don't like i like i like to see
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.320]   see value put onto these sort of things i think it's part of the the great training process of
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:03.920]   training people to actually spend money on apps as opposed to this should be free stupid when
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:11.040]   started yeah and you don't have to buy a bunch of levels yeah it's just you you own the game and
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:18.800]   you play the game and yeah i like it yep uh wow this is it we're done kids but i hope you had a
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:23.520]   good time jim dallerimple and i hope you'll come back now that you know the way i had a great time

[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:21.840]   nations and i'm more dot com andy and not co has your watch review appeared in the chicago
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:28.240]   sometimes yet no not yet because i i understand i i do need to get hopping on that one uh i i
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:33.840]   find that you know after after about a month i had a decent review ready after about two weeks after
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:38.000]   that i felt like oh now i understand it and now there's been two months it's like i know exactly
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.520]   what i want to say i felt i felt as though i don't trust honestly any wearable particularly apple
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:49.360]   watch do not trust any review that comes out after only about a week or two of experience with it
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:55.680]   because you really do have to wear it for an entire month and also be prepared to realize that
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:01.840]   your expectations were not necessarily correct uh and so before you can judge it on on what it is
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:09.520]   so i'm i'm i'm i'm hoping it's going to be out uh in the next ten days but i'm really really pleased
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:14.640]   with the drafts that i have right now because i think i've i think i've i my goal is just to every
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:19.120]   time i read review is to make sure that it's there's a reason for it to exist and i think that there'll
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:24.640]   be a reason for this one to exist absolutely and uh we look forward to it you could follow
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:31.440]   and it's not only the chicago sometimes at his website cwob.com and on the twitter i-h-n-a-t-k-o
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:38.400]   thank you all for being here we do mac break weekly every tuesday 11 a.m pacific 2 p.m eastern time 1800
