[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. We're going to drill deep, drill down on the Apple TV story.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.200]   Maybe it makes a little sense. Once you add it all up, the startup chime is now trademarked.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.400]   And we'll talk about new apps and the best apps of 2012.

[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers all your Macintosh needs. What are you doing, Burke?
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   Oh, that's Brian. There's a little hero camera on a dolly that's about this big.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   Are you going to have an amazing pan here? Look at this. Look at the mini hero dolly with skateboard wheels.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   Did you build that?
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   Oh, it's a special. Are you reviewing? Don't show the fact that I'm playing a Simpsons game during the show.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   Oh, my secrets are out. Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Inaco, we're in beautiful Boston, where it's still 74 degrees and sunny.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   Exactly. The windsurfing is a little bit challenging today.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   You can always tell when it's like on every local new show, when it's like one week before, like the deadline for like, am I consideration tapes?
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   Because that's when they put on the, let's put the gels on, let's have the dolly shots.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Let's use the boom mic. God dang it, I'm going to have a local Emmy this year.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   So that's of course, that's when you're putting out the camera on the radio control dolly.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   Exactly. I support that. You deserve acknowledgement from your professional peers.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   Actually, we are nominated for the International Academy of TV on the Web Awards, which are at CES on Tuesday.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   So in fact, I'm nominated for like best personality, right? And then there's some other twins who have nominated for news.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   Yeah, and Tiante for news. So anyway, so that's kind of like that.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   And we did break out the Festivus poll, as you can see. Festivus for the rest of us. That's our big holiday poll.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   And you see, we've received four cards and we've strung them behind me. God, that's depressing.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   When I said, let's put up our Christmas cards behind me. I thought it'd be a full wall of stuff.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   It's four cards. Renee Richie is here from iMore.com.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   And Montreal, it's always snowing.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   It is. And now it's snowing in 48 frames per second.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   It looks like a bad history channel remake. Nothing looks better than snow at 48 frames per second.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   It's super realistic. Super realistic.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   And just as I recorded my Nexus four, I've got to find out how to unbox it next.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   Oh, yeah, that's excellent. Well, you do the unboxing. Even though this is Mac break weekly.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   Mac break. I'm gonna get in some trouble.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   Here's a man who never, never gives up on the Mac. He is done. McAllister of Screencasts online from Liverpool, England. Hi, Don.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   Hello, Leo. Hi. Nice. I've taken all my cards down because I thought, you know, I thought, no, I don't have all my cards.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.800]   I've taken them down. Good. You were shaming me.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   No, no, no, not really. How are you?
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   I'm great. Last time I saw Don was in Sydney, Australia.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   Yeah, that last day was a little bit, a bit ropey. I must admit, towards the end of the cruise, I thought, a little bit seasick on that journey.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   I took a video of the pool going.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   But wasn't that a great trip? Yeah.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   Yeah, it's good. It seemed an awful long time. It was near three weeks with the travel from me as well.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   It was good.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   You and Barbara had a long way back to Liverpool. It seemed like...
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   Yeah, we sort of got off the boat and went straight to the airport and then traveled straight back.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   So it was quite a good one.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   Quite an ordeal. And a week. It took about a week to go to the jet lag as well, which was a shock to me. I didn't take that long.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   Mac Mania is so much fun, though. And what's nice now, this is the geek cruises that, gosh, we've been doing for some years.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   I think my first Mac Mania was, Mac Mania 3 or, I guess it was 4 in 2004. And this is Mac Mania 15.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   And it's so much fun because now we're getting a lot of repeat people. And Alison Sheridan from Nuzila Cass, she was new.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   That was fun to have her. And we just had a great time. Jean McDonald from Smile Software was there.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   Yeah. I mean, there are a great bunch of people. And you do make friends for life as well on these sorts of...
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   You do. You just can't shake them. I deleted them from Facebook and everything. And they just...
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   [laughter]
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   Coming back.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   Anyway, welcome to all of you. This is our last Mac break of the year.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   Next week is Christmas Day, and we're going to do our Mac break weekly best of.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   And then New Year's Day, I just don't think that it's a reasonable thing to ask anybody to get up New Year's Day morning to do a Mac break weekly,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   especially since I don't think Apple will be doing anything.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   I don't know. I mean, it's... If I've got a mic stand and I could just basically put it next to my most comfortable chair.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   As far as I don't... I'm not expecting to get out of my bathroom.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   Don't get up.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   Masterpiece Theatre, Mac break weekly. [laughter]
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   Good evening. I'm Alistair Nastko.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   Watching the Apple stock, that's always fun. And boy, it just... It's been going through and up and down.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   It's very volatile right now. But as with all the tech stocks, it took a big jump over the last couple of days, up ten bucks today alone.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   But nowhere near, it's high of $705. It's at $528.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.800]   I think we talked a little bit about this last week, but is this something that anybody should pay any attention to,
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   or is this just the stock market doing its thing?
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   Andy, do you have any... I know nobody here probably is... I certainly... We don't invest in any of the tech stocks.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   And I'm sure you don't either, Andy.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   No, I mean, it's an ethical problem. And also, there are times when I know things that aren't available to the general public.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   And so it's weird enough that I guess I shouldn't do it.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   But also, I mean, it's not something that any rational fan or user of Apple products should even care about.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   You care about it when the company is a little bit on the ropes,
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   or when there are rumors that there's a part of the company that's desirable by another company,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   because the stock can do something that will make it... Well, geez, we can either spend $80 million to create our own research and development project on this sort of platform,
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   or we could simply buy this company that already has that and have been doing this for four years,
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   in which case, everything that is not that one product that they want goes away.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   But obviously, that's not going to... I mean, visiting aliens who are able to transmute sarcasm into gold
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   can disrupt the economy enough that they can afford to actually buy out Apple to get what they want from it.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   Nobody else can actually touch it, so who cares?
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   Yeah. And sometimes, though, I think that maybe what's happening at the stock market is the growing sense that it is not Steve Jobs' Apple anymore,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   and that $705 was a vote of confidence for Steve Jobs.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   And now, it's not that Tim Cook and Johnny Ive and Eddie Q aren't going to do a good job,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   but they're a little bit more of an unknown, perhaps.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   So the uncertainty back? Yeah, they have to earn it back, I would guess.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   It's really strange, though, isn't it? Because Nokia were... I think I read somewhere that Nokia outperformed Apple stock three times over,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   something in the past few months. It's just crazy.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   When you do see the figures that they put out each quarter, and I have to say, full disclosure,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   I have got a few shares in Apple, just a couple tiny little shares, but I'm not an independent journalist.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   I'm an Apple. I don't mind.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   And I don't think there's anything that you could say on this show that would pump the stock price.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   I don't think so. I think you're safe.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   It's all $20 from saying that.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   Exactly, as Andy said, it's not a normal person problem. We buy in sales talks.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   Apple is so valuable, it's owned by a lot of hedge funds and institutional investors,
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   and when Apple's really valuable, a large percentage of their holdings ends up being an Apple,
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   and they might not be comfortable with that. People who've held Apple for a long time can sell just to take profit on it
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   before the end of the year. There's so many factors that go into it. I think it's hard to read those tealies.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   I actually do that. I rebalance.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   But I do it for my retirement. I have funds.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   And as you age, you have different percentages, but let's say you have 20% bonds, 30% international,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   or 60% equities, that kind of thing.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   And if any one category starts to do really well, you get over-invested in that category.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   So you have to rebalance. That's exactly what you're saying. I'm just saying it again in a less understandable way.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   But rebalancing your portfolio. So they're over-invested in Apple because suddenly Apple is so high
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   that they might want to diversify and put some money in some other stocks.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   And that makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   I have to say that it seems a bit strange at this particular point in the year,
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   with launching so many new products at the end of the last year.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   I don't know if it's affecting the stock price or whatever, but it does seem as though there's a bit of uncertainty
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   going forward as to what they're going to do over the next 12 months, because they've done so much in the last 12 months.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   How can they repeat what they've done? How can they keep the momentum going?
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   What new products are they bringing out? When are they going to bring them out?
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   So from my perspective, I think there's a lot of uncertainty about, obviously, they have got plans,
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   but what those plans are unknown to anyone. And they've sort of been bringing the iPad out early
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   and are they going to move to a six-monthly product cycle?
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   Have they got this Apple TV in the pipeline? And what are the new products that have got in the pipeline?
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   I think there's a lot of uncertainty around Apple at the moment, because we just don't know what they've got lined up for next year.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   I'm looking, the Apple price to earning, which is the stock price compared to its earnings, is a fairly reasonable $11.97.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   And I'm looking over at Amazon.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   Whose price to earning is $3,469.66.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   There's a very different...
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   So, you know, I think Apple seems a little safer, at least if that's the metric you're looking at.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   Wow.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   Hey, good news. Apple has spent a little bit of that, what is it, $130 billion in cash?
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   They have a pretty good cash position on an electric bus from Warren Buffett.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   Warren Buffett is apparently building something called the Canine Electric Bus.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   They're 550 to 600,000 each, and Apple will be the first customer, a Chinese company that's going to be building
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   these electric buses.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   The Buffett Bus.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   Oh boy, if they're buying those for the Apple campus, I believe there's going to be a lot of government involvement.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   Chinese government involvement.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   They're going to make sure that every millimeter of that is done to perfection.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   It's going to be the only one where there's transmitters and high-def cameras in the strap hangers for one of those things.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   It's actually not necessarily untrue.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   Remember that Steve Jobs was very involved in the Apple Bus.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   The Apple Bus that takes the shuttle's employees from San Francisco to Cupertino is reputedly the most like a private jet.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   Leather seats, the same leather that you see in the notepad application on Apple.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   Awesome.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   And just apparently beautiful Wi-Fi and stereos, and just apparently it's a very lovely bus for those who take the shuttle
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.800]   from San Francisco to Cupertino every day.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   Wouldn't mind that myself.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   Apple moving closer to making a TV set.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   I hate to report these stories because I don't buy it.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   But the Wall Street Journal has always been in the past kind of the gold standard for Apple rumors.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   They seem to have a connection directly to one infinite loop.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   They're working according to the Wall Street Journal with component suppliers in Asia to test several designs
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   for television sets.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   And this is the key phrase people familiar with this situation said.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   It could be Apple, it could be China, right?
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   Suggesting the company is closer to expanding its offerings.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   Hon-high, which does the iPhone and iPad, is working with Sharp on a new TV.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   It's not a formal project yet.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   It's still in the early stages of testing your thoughts on McAllister, Apple TV.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   We haven't asked you lately.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.800]   What do you think?
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   Well, I'm torn because I mean that report does say it's not even reached a final production stage.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.800]   It's a prototype.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   But I mean one half me says they don't need to.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   They've got the Apple TV that they're into content.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   Why would they need to build just a big slab of glass that can hang in your living room?
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   And then the other part of me says, well, actually, it's a consumer electronics company now.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   It's a big market.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   They could do a nice job on it.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   They've guaranteed sales that could be a high margin item.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   And I think they do want to control the entire experience.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   I'm sure that they do want to, when you switch that TV off, have Apple come up in the middle and you've got the
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   full Apple ecosystem surrounding it and the full Apple experience.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   But I'm still torn.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   I'd certainly buy one if they brought one out, obviously.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   Well, they will or not.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   I don't know.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.800]   I don't know if it's just one of those things that they have to in the end or they'll just go with the hockey
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   puck and sort of make all the money off smart set top boxes or integrating their electronics with other people's.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   It just seems so far-fetched.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.800]   And yet it's a rumor that will not go away.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   Is that because we want it to be true or because there keeps being a drum beat out of?
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   I think it's a logical progression.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   I think people when they look at what Apple are doing and their experience with manufacturing these huge monitors
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   and the iMacs, etc.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   It seems a logical progression to think that they would take the next step on and go into TVs.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   But it's a completely different market from the computer market.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   You don't replace your TV that often and the size of them.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   I don't know.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   It's one of those where I say no, where I don't want to say no, they definitely won't because I'm sure they probably will
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   in the end.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   But it's just how long it takes them to get there.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.800]   We're so gun shy now about predicting what Apple could do because it's just like, whoa, they did.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   Seven inch iPad? No, they never.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   Whoa, they did.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   But isn't it funny because we've heard the stories so often before.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   There's nothing new in this report.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.800]   Something really new except for some of the supply chain stuff.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   And it reads like a supply chain rumor, not an Apple rumor because I don't think anyone believes that the supply chain is
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   designing this television set and not Johnny.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.800]   And as far as Apple, Apple's been playing with TVs for years.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   They probably have them in the lab, but it's not an approaching product.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   And the timing of this seems odd because you're going into Christmas.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   It's not an Apple product cycle.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   All the reports of Apple negotiations with content providers have stalled.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   So it's interesting that this would come up now and not that it would be a rumor.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   They say Han Hai is specializing in 60 inch plus screens.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   So if it were to be a very large screen, I think that any company that is thinking about making a product,
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   of course, is going to go to the factories and make prototypes to see if it's makeable,
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   if it's doable and what issues come up.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.800]   It doesn't mean even that they're going to release a product.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   But I would guess that they are in fact making prototypes, which means they're at least considering it, right, Andy?
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   Yeah, I mean, they consider a lot of things.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   I mean, you've seen every couple of years some sort of really, really close description of a weird Apple product leaks out.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   And there's all this sort of excitement saying, "Oh, they're getting into the sports equipment business
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   because there's a pair of Apple ice gates."
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.800]   Well, no, maybe somebody, they have the sort of resources where they play with all kinds of different ideas.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   I can't remember any rumor being this persistent though.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   Well, but it's so natural.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   That was true, right? That happened.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   Yeah, I mean, that happened.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.800]   But there was also a lot of people talking about an Apple camera at some point.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.800]   And that sort of had its day and then sort of died out when people realized, "Oh, they did make an Apple camera.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   It's called the iPhone."
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   Maybe, and it's possible that we're going to see an extension of this rumor in exactly that same way,
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   where it's true that Apple was working on a TV set.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   They were actually just building ideas of, "Well, what if the industry goes in this direction?
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   How could we best put software on this sort of display?"
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   And because they have the sort of resources where they can actually build this sort of nominal display
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   and start targeting apps for it so they would be ready for it,
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   that means that they can actually build this sort of thing.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   Even if they really don't know yet if they're even interested in building separate hardware,
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   they know that at some point there might be a 60-inch display that has Gigabit Ethernet built into it
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   or at least a former Wi-Fi that's as fast as that.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   How would they best take advantage of that?
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   There are touchscreen iMacs somewhere in Cupertino that doesn't mean they want to build one
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   because they want to figure out what that would be like.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   If that makes them ready in two years from now,
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   when it makes sense for them to do a touchscreen iMac, all the better.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   If it also makes them understand better why they need to target keyboards and mouse and multi-touch pads
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   specifically instead of touch pads, that's also money we'll spend.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   So I have to keep coming back to Hell if I know if Apple's building an Apple TV.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   It doesn't make sense to me, but then again, I've got this puny mortal brain.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   I don't know.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   I willingly give companies money for a rather silly amount of soda
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   and I will drink it all into our period.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   So please don't go for me on whether I think Apple's going to build something you're not.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   It could be that it could be tied into with display technologies.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   It could be to do, you know, as part of the overall retina strategy,
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   that when 4K TVs are able to be manufactured at a reasonable price,
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.800]   they might come in at that point and create a TV to end all TVs,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   no super high resolution screens, et cetera.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   But it's all conjecture and just getting really where they might go.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   60 inch iMac.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   And then we'll be talking about the 80 inch iMac.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:08.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   Where is that 80 inch?
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   Where is the Visa mount on the 80 inch iMac?
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   Exactly.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   Well, just still...
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   Go ahead.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   And the SD card slot is on the other side of the wall.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   I...
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   You can't find the slot.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   Look for where the power cord comes in.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   I'll tell you when you got it.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   Jeremy Allaire, who I love.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   He's a founder and chairman and CEO of Bright Cove,
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   but he also developed one of the greatest Mac web tools ever,
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   which was called, was it Home Site?
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   I think it was, I can't remember the name of it.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   Has written an article, a guest article for all things.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   The all I want for Christmas is my Apple TV.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   And he...
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   I think it's a fairly good analysis.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   And he says, "Let's imagine Christmas 2013 and the new line of Apple TV products.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   I hope to find under my tree.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   The new Apple TV, three key values, he says you'd have to include, if it's Apple,
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   it would have to be the best way to consume broadcast TV and any online video."
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   I think that's important.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   I think cord cutters suffer because they can't get broadcast.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   They can't get live.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   They miss important events.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   The ultimate game console.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   Apple TV will be a direct assault on the game console industry.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   That's getting...
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   That actually is in play because all the consoles are very old.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   Microsoft reputedly at E3 in June will announce the next Xbox.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   I'm not sure, Chad, do you know what Sony's plans are for the PlayStation?
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   Will there be a PS4?
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   Well, the PlayStation 4, they... or 3, when they originally announced that they said that it was going to be a 10-year life cycle.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.800]   And you're at 10 years, aren't they?
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   You can sort of see...
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   Yeah, they're getting really close to the end of that.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.800]   You can see that they just released a new Xbox or a PlayStation 3 Slim.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   It has a top loading drive.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   Yeah, that's what all these companies do.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   They try to, you know, kind of milk this sucker.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   Right.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   Yeah, the PS4 is definitely a rumor.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   Still, the idea is that at Next D3, there may be...
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   I just don't... I don't...
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   An announcement and then the year after it would come out.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   That's the rumor.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   But it's not like with the Xbox 720 where they've actually shown off...
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   They said they're gonna do it.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.800]   Yeah, in the official Xbox magazine, they've shown off some stuff.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   And then Nintendo with the Wii U.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   But I think what really puts it in play is Steam has now said that they're gonna make it...
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   ...hardware a Steam box.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   If you have Steam on your Mac, they already have the big screen experience.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   You can see it and it's great.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   It's definitely designed to use with a controller or, you know, I mean, it's a beautiful thing.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   And it's your Steam games.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:03.800]   Yeah, consumers understand Steam now where you buy it once, you can play it on your PC or Mac.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.800]   And if they make a console, you can play it there too.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   They understand that Steam is an exciting...
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   ...is an exciting...
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   ...a $300 and it's doable because I've seen people do prototypes, a $300 Steam box comparable to an Xbox or PS4.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.800]   Interesting idea.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   Anyway, Apple wants to be in that game.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   They're not in that game now, although with iOS they are in that game, right?
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   I was about to say, I mean, you look at the top, what, 20 games?
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   Sorry, first, the top 20 revenue generating apps and they're all games.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   You keep going page after page after page after page.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.800]   You have to drill pretty deep down before you find...
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   ...something that is not involved killing that imaginary computer.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   Do you think that's unexpected?
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   Do you think Apple's surprised that iPad turns out an iPhone in some ways?
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   It turns out to be a gaming device.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   Well, because it's not only that, but because they make it so easy to buy things inside the games.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   And remember that most good games are built the same way that like a casino game is made.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   It really is a serotonin depositing system.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   It's designed to basically put your brain in.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   Not even really joking.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   I mean, the best design games are ones that sort of manage that flow of chemicals,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   of risk, involvement, creativity and reward.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   And they make sure they dole out the rewards and on a nicely scheduled basis that puts you at a buying position
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   right at the point which you want to get another reward.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   So it's absolutely no surprise that the games are the ones that make a lot of money.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   The question though is that can they...
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   Have they developed a successful game system, a game architecture, just full out?
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   Or have they created a system that's really great for mobile gaming?
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   That's sort of intimate.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   I'm holding this thing in my hand and the entire world of the game is in the screen in my hand.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   Or is that something that they could really expand into the idea of few and three friends in front of a 16 inch television set
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.800]   working on a campaign together?
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.800]   That maybe remains to be seen.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.800]   Well, let's go on with Jeremy Allaire's Gudanken experiment, his thought experiment.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   Because it's actually...
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   Even if it's complete BS, it's great.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   I love it.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   So his third core value that Apple will have to express is the best way to experience all of your apps.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   So to take that, exactly what you're talking about, Andy, to take that ecosystem and move it onto a big screen,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   he says they need a two prong strategy and I like this.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   They continue to do a companion device for TV.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   He says $149 attaches to any existing TV, does not require a new monitor.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   He says this is crucial for quickly establishing and maintaining platform dominance.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   Even the standalone could be a $5 to $10 billion opportunity.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   Remember, you're adding to the existing Apple TV things like apps.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   And then two, a new family of ultra thin TV monitors that bundles all the capabilities of the companion device
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   and includes beefed up computing power.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   These large screen monitors will be a direct assault on the global TV monitor industry,
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   a market worth hundreds of billions annually, albeit with slightly slower replacement cycles
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   of four years versus two years for smartphones and tablets.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   This gives Apple that additional 30 billion plus revenue stream it needs.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   And then he goes on to define what such a thing would be.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   The Apple TV companion would be the A7 quad-core CPU, 1080p video,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   HDMI digital audio output, gigabit ethernet, built in Wi-Fi, two lightning ports,
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   one for power, other for the included coax dongle so that you could put your cable TV.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   See, I think the smart cable TV box is where they want to be.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   And he's actually got, Jeremy's awesome.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   He's actually got graphics.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   And then the ultra thin monitor coming in 46 and 60 inch models, glass, front,
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   aluminum back, stand and rear mounting options, you know, look like a basic,
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   you know, an Apple cinema display perhaps.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   Full capabilities will be complemented.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   The companion device will be built in along with additional audio, video,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   lighting ports, lightning ports, storage of up to three terabytes,
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   gorgeous display quality, probably 4K.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   This is a great, I mean, you know, it's a fantasy.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   It's like science fiction, but I love it.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.800]   What if Apple built a TV?
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.800]   Yeah, what if?
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   I mean, they've got lots of these components in place already, haven't they?
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   They're experimenting.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   They've got the AirPlay architecture, which I think is really significant.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   You know, the fact that you can actually broadcast from your mobile device to your TV.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   Now, we're still to see the collaborative sort of gaming come to fruition.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   But they're experimenting with, you know, mentioned before about cable cutters when I see live TV,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   we've seen with the iTunes concert series, you know, streaming live concerts for a whole month
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   and that worked fantastically.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   And then you had the, you know, the live event at the last Apple keynote.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   So it's all these little bits that sort of got the fingers into all these pies
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   and they keep exposing them and then hiding them and experimenting.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   So, you know, I'm sure there is an overarching strategy that will get us to something like you've just described.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   But they're sort of like a very slowly, slowly game to get there.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   He says, imagine playing Call of Duty massive with a gorgeous 60-inch display.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   You're using a standard controller for first-person shooter play.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   A friend next to you manage ops from the iPad controller.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   A few more friends watch along from their iPhones while they're riding in the bus.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   Another friend receives a push notification alerting them to a crisis that could use their help.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   They look away from that they're watching on TV and jump into the game from the tablet.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   What is interesting, and I think what Jeremy's point more is that there are a couple of industries
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   that are ripe for disruption that Apple could, with their massive cash and their willingness to take chances,
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   jump into.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   Well, that's a big question there willingness to take chances.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   Jump into one is the gaming industry and the other is television content, cable and satellite and so forth.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   And he does point out there's a lot of money to be made in all of this.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   Yeah, and it does also click into Apple getting more revenue from services than actual hardware products.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   It's good for them to be making money from things that don't actually involve them keeping a hold on the imagination of the people.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   They have to keep pumping out a different phone every year, a different tablet every year, a different notebook every year,
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   restyle it, redesign it so that it still looks as attractive and as compelling as they can possibly make it.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   I think that somewhere there's a, I do believe that somewhere there's a faction side of Apple that says that in 15 years from now,
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   if we're not making most of our money from pushing electrons from one place to another,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   then we're probably going to be missing the boat in a major way.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:46.800]   But again, I still fall back on the fact that I just can't imagine, you know, how they can make the case for by our $150,
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   by our, you know, our $2,000 TV set instead of letting you go out and get whatever TV set you want, plugging the hockey puck into it.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   I mean, you do both, right?
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   You do both.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   Well, yeah, well, I mean, instead of Apple,
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   I don't know why Apple would want to get into this idea, this, this TV market where most people hang on to this device and are very, very happy with it for so many years in a row.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   I mean, you plug it in, you don't really notice this TV until it stops working.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   At which point you suddenly become aware of what's happened in the TV market over the past four or five years and you buy something new,
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   it wows you for about a month.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   And then once again, it becomes something that you totally ignore because you really pay attention to what's going on inside the limitations of that frame.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   I tell you why, I tell you why, because people are trying to do what this Germany, Germany-Alaire thought experiment is doing.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   They want this unified experience.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   They want this clean experience and they're trying to do it by plugging in things into their TV.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   They've got boxes hanging off.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   They've got HDMI switchers just so they can do this.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   And I think it's not necessarily a huge portion of the market, but let's say 10% of the existing market,
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   the people who buy Apple products because they want the design.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   If Apple goes to them and says, "Look, we will unify this experience."
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.800]   There's more to be gained than just selling a TV set.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   Now you've got a full ecosystem.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   Isn't that what Apple wants?
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   You've got the full ecosystem all the way around iPhone, iPad, maybe a desktop, maybe not.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   Maybe this replaces the desktop business.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   I think that there's some interesting play.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   I'm sure that somewhere on the board, Germany-Alaire has written the PowerPoint, the keynote deck, for them, basically.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   There's a lot of asterisks to like, just when you put broadcast TV device.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   I mean, Apple does not historically do well with things that they do not control,
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   whether it's FedEx shipments arriving days late for tablets or AT&T making the iPhone not really work as a phone.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.800]   What if they're making a bet that they can disrupt it, that they can take it over?
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   Well, they still have to plug that coax adapter, plug your coax.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   The TV is not working.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   Oh, sorry.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   We don't dis scramble signals for Apple TVs.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   You have to buy our scientific Atlanta circa 2007 box to do that.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   Well, that's what they've got to make it.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   None of this works unless you reinvent the industry.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   I mean, the reason why people still have the mindset that a TV is something that we don't replace very often is because in the past, the TV was just that.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   It was just a television receiver.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   Whereas an integrated Apple TV could be so much more.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   And if they're constantly upgrading and changing and improving, that would then give the percentage of people who are interested in that sort of thing, the reason to actually upgrade this big piece of kit more often you would a traditional TV.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   It can't be furniture anymore.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   Well, I'm surprised to see, for instance, that it's a four-year upgrade cycle.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   I would have thought it was much longer than that.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   I'm not lining up every year for your TV, Leo.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   No.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   No.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   But remember, going to a two-year cycle for Apple was a kind of a departure, I guess.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   Maybe not.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.800]   Four years is like computers, right?
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   Isn't that what the desktop upgrade turnaround is?
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   I think that that doesn't necessarily scare them.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   Well, the other problem they're facing is that I think people make too much of the word disruption because Apple disrupted the phone market and how they are selling about 17% of the phones instead of a holy commanding lead, even in their phone.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   They're demanding lead, even in their specific sector.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   They disrupted with the IAMAC.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   And now the Mac OS is still not--they've been holding very, very steady and making gains, particularly compared to what PC manufacturers are doing.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   But I don't believe that Samsung and Dell and Lenovo feel as though they're being disrupted by the Mac at all.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   I mean, it's okay to discover this new plot of land that no one else has discovered before, but you get that to yourself for about a couple of years before other people who are just as clever in many ways as you are, figure out, "Oh, here's where we get there.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   Great.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   Now, let's plan our own flag and start building stuff here."
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   Isn't that what the stock market's telling them, though, is you've come to the end of this cycle.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   We don't have faith that you're going to figure out what the next thing is.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.800]   Well, they're telling them that we consider you a hit-driven business unlike Amazon and Amazon and other things.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   Right.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   So you better keep making hits.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   That's how we understand you.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   Right.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   Where's the next hit?
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   Understanding stock prices is way of the perfect rate.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   Honestly, I've gone out to lunch with friends who do nothing but work on this every day.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   I mean, they're transacting an ungodly amount of money that is not theirs.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   And I've tried to have them explain it to me.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   And they will say things that words that I understand in sentences that I can parse as English grammar and the logic of it doesn't stick with me for more than 10 minutes.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   So the volatility of the stock market is so impenetrable that I just have to remind myself that if you think that the reason why, you know, that this stock has dropped, dropped 50 points is because it's a sell-off or because of this investor has now quit from the board and moved to this place
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   and dumped some stock with some profit-taking.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   There's probably 12 different factors you don't understand.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   In addition to the 50 that you've never even heard of.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   No, you're smart to rec- you know me.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   I just can't ever say.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   I don't understand something.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   I mean, it's fun to talk about this stuff though.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   Because it is dramatic when you say this was worth $700 before.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   Now it's worth $500.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   It's like you watch that episode of Antiques Roadshow where someone said, "Well, if you tried to sell this eight years ago when the market was very, very hot for tongue-deripottery, today it's cooled off a little bit, so it's only worth about half of that."
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   And people have disappointed, "Oh, this thing that I was going to throw away is only worth $8,000 instead of $16,000.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   Why am I now sad?"
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   Well, because I'm learning enough about it in the way it's a finance to know that $8,000 is a smaller number than $16,000.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   But remember, we keep saying, "Well, what is Apple going to do with its $100 billion plus cash?
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   What would it cost for this kind of an investment, a fraction of that, right?"
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   And so it's kind of like a gambler who's got a big stack of chips in front of him, who's going to take some bigger chances now than he would have if he had a conserve.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   Well, I mean, they might be saving that up to make their own GPU, but I think with the television thing, I can just see it now.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   Apple announces a television, stock market says, "Where's the car?"
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   And I think that's all that Apple's missing now.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   No, exactly right.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   In a couple of years, they would say, "Okay, what have you done for me lately?"
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   No, exactly right.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   But that's what we're seeing now.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   Okay, you got the iPhone.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   Okay, you got the iPad.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   You completely reinvented the music industry, the computer industry, and the phone industry.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   Now what?
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   So the thing is, though, they can't experiment, can they? Because if they make a TV, they can't make a TV to satisfy a portion of the demand.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   You know, with any Apple product, that they need to gauge it right, because if they make, because it's severely under-produced the Apple TV, that's a disaster.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   No, it isn't.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   Why is it a disaster?
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   Well, it's because, well, you know, people in the know would see it as a disaster, because they can't make enough to sell them.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   People say, "Oh, you should be making more money than the money you're making." But in some ways, it would shut us all up if they sold out, and we couldn't get one.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   And they probably...
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   If I want it!
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   If they've existed, I want it.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   I want it!
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   They can't just do it limited run, can they?
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   They would have to produce enough to fill the next three or four months.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   As the chatroom is saying, it's one thing to do this in the US, which is not easy, but then what about global markets? And Apple is increasingly a global company.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   You know, it's funny, though. I remember the days of the Macintosh where nobody outside the US used Macs.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   Of course, you do too, I'm sure.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   Oh, yeah. It's only really the last seven or eight years that they've really sort of become to prominence in the UK.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   Before then, there were always here, but in such limited numbers, they could have a normal person would never see.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   They would drive across town to get to the one Apple store.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   Exactly.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   I'd have an Apple store that sold Macs.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   Yeah, yeah, it wasn't an Apple store yet.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   So this is not... I mean, Apple can make a success in the US that gradually expands.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   I'm slowly being convinced, and I'll tell you what. I know I've been the one... a naysayer for two years, but I'll tell you what, I'm due for an upgrade on one of my TVs about six years old, and I'm not buying it.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   I'm not buying one.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   Leo, because they're really happy.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   Come on, you're not...
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   I'm not...
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   No, I'm waiting because I have a nice hole right between my surround-sense system that I'm waiting to fill with an Apple TV.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   I see that the funny thing is though, I needed to replace one and I just ended up just going out and buying a really cheap, you know, really... that's a two-year-old plasma one, you know, the end of life-line, because I'm not going to spend a lot money on a TV in the next couple of years, just in case.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   I think that that's... now, somebody's pointing out that Aireo, which is a very interesting enterprise, which is currently only available in New York City, Barry Diller launched this service.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   The idea is each person has an individual antenna, and so they have these little tiny, you know, dime-sized antennas, and they have a raise of them in New York City, and they pick up all over the air signals, and then you can use it, watch it on your iPad, and they... these television stations took them to come to the...
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   television stations took them to court and lost, because Aireo didn't ask.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   Federal courts said, "Well, I guess it's not completely resolved." Aireo has now added Bloomberg TV content, its first cable channel.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   Now, what if Barry Diller, who does have ties to Apple, says, "Maybe this whole play is... we're building something here that eventually is going to be nationwide, and it's going to go right to an Apple device."
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   I mean, already does, it's an iPad product.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   I was pretty excited when I got a press release from Elgato about... they had those nice Mac TV dongles.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   A lot of stuff.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   TV TV tuners that'll basically turn your Mac into a DVR, and share it out, where you can later on access your recorded programs through an iOS app.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   And they have a new product that looks like something that you plug into the dock connector and has a little stubby antenna that will actually receive TV broadcasts directly.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   And of course, I'm pressing the mouse button with my knuckles.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   I'm so excited to hear about this.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   And no, it's a pay subscription service that micro-greetransmits content.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   So it's not pulling terrestrial signals off the air.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   It's using a new, a regional service that's available in a limited number of cities that rebroadcast.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   Not the entire station lineup, but whatever few handfuls of stations have decided to rebroadcast on this tiny little network.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   So it's a great idea.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   And I think that really the people who want to crack it are the people who want to...
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   They're so desperate to crack it that they are willing to roll out this technology where they're willing to put out a pair of antennas for each subscriber they add to the network.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   This is using a system called DialDYLE.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   There have been a number of people trying to do this exact thing.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   But do you feel as though this is a little bit like...
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.800]   You remember back in the 70s when Polaroid responded to VHS...
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   Excuse me, responded to a video tape by creating chemical movie film in a cassette that you shot with a special camera.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   You plunked into this thing with a TV screen, but the chemicals would process and you could watch it on this thing.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   It seems as though if they're working this hard to get people to be able to access the networks,
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   at a time when people are sort of fleeing the networks for cable programming and losing their allegiance to even cable channels for actual specific programs.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   It's a great idea and I hope it arrives in Boston because I'll be a subscriber.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   But it's like I don't really necessarily want CBS.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   I want the Letterman Show. I want the Ferguson Show.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   That's true.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   You might want local news.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   And you certainly would want local sports.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   And what other live events like the Oscars, but I think this is all...
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   We're in the middle of a massive Z change here. It's clear.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.800]   And I think that's why Apple could stick a little finger in the pie chat.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   I have a thought experiment for the panel.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   So if Apple needs to control the experience, do you think that they would only sign with a few networks?
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   So you could only get it if you were on say Comcast or Time Warner or Dish.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:07.800]   And it's a lot like the cellular networks where you're tied into one content provider and that's it.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.800]   I think what Apple would try to do is eliminate...
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   They may not be able to the Comcasts of the world and go directly to CBS.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   If they could get one network available, that would be a wedge that could...
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   And I think they did...
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   Look what they did with music and iTunes.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   You get one label that you can slowly work your way up because everybody looks at what CBS is doing going, "Oh gosh.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   It just got one." And I don't know what the one would be, but it just got one. That would be a start.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   Just get Disney Leo. Then we have the Star Wars.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   They have Disney. That's the one thing we know they have.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   But on the other hand, is any network willing to become as beholden to Apple as the record companies felt as though they were beholden to Apple when they started off with the iTunes Store?
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   They had some leverage, but Apple got most of the terms that they wanted from them.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   Even then, it was a drag-out battle to get the service off the ground.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   Now that there's actually that example of a potential competitor more powerful than we are as the networks.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   CBS, I'm sure that they would...
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   If they could realign the Heaven so that every subscriber had to buy a CBS cable box that would...
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   They would subscribe for CBS content directly.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   They would certainly wave that magic wand and make that happen.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:34.800]   I think that mostly they're... I think that most of what this will happen is not through networks necessarily, but through production companies.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   NBC makes so much money, not makes so much money because...
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   Sorry, rewind. I've had too much eggnog.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   It's been an early one.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   I wish I had some eggnog.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   I'm sorry, what I'm saying is I think they're more likely to do this to areas in which the networks have greater control.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   Most of the shows that are on network television are co-produced by the network themselves.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   So that's why they can put some episodes on Hulu, they can put some episodes on iTunes.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   So I think that's where the deals are going to be, where you're not going to get access to all NBC content.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   You're going to get access to all content that NBC is producing themselves.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.800]   Disney owns ABC, Web 66, 78 points in a chatroom.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   Good point. And when you own ABC, you also own ESPN.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   You own a lot.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   It may be that that's where the crack in the egg happens is that Disney ABC, ESPN.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   Wouldn't you be interested in the box that could give you those without... with just a data plan?
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   That would be kind of interesting.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   Don't you think that though, we're going to have to get all the stuff that we want.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   We're going to have to wait for people who are 15, 16, 17, 18-year-olds right now, 18 years old right now.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   When they are 31, 32, 33, and senior executives with the networks,
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.800]   that's when these things are going to happen.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   Because those people are going to... the first generation that grew up with this sort of total mental disconnection
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   from the idea of network programming and fixed schedules.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   They're going to see, well, why the hell would we not...
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   What would we refuse to let someone purchase our content and purchase our programming
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   in the way that they want to get it on the device that they want?
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   That's just... that's sort of pretend that... unless we're selling them the Lawrence Welk Show,
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   that really that's not the way to sell them modern programming.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   Right.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   Very interesting stuff.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.800]   We're going to take a break, and we have lots... it turns out.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   And that's always happens to me.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   I thought, "Oh, it's going to be a very light day. Nothing going on."
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.800]   Meanwhile, I've just found a reason to delete Instagram permanently forever for my iPhone.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   We'll talk about that.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   We will discuss the new iTunes.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   Just came out.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   What was missing is back.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   The iOS 6.02 and why it's important.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   Lots more.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.800]   And the classic Mac startup chime.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   Now a registered trademark.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   But first, a word from a audible.com.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.800]   I love the holidays.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   I love taking time to listen to great books by the fire with a cup of eggnog.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   It's just... there's something about... you know, I like reading.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   And one of the things vacation always means to me is reading a book,
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.800]   but lately it's... reading has been for me listening because of audible.com.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.800]   Part of that is that Audible now has everything.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   When I first became an Audible member in 2001,
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   the publishers were not quite so enlightened.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   They didn't make audio books of everything.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.800]   Audible kind of handled that by creating their own studios in the Audible Frontiers program,
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   for instance, where they took sci-fi that had never been recorded
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.800]   and made brilliant audio productions out of it.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   That changed my life because I'm a big sci-fi fan.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   Oh, here's a great one. The wind-up girl.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   I just finished that a few months ago by Paolo Machikalupi.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   It was a... it was a... a sword and laser pick.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   So here's the deal. Go to Audible.com/MacBreak
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   and you can get a book free.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.800]   Pretty simple, huh?
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   All you have to do is sign up for the gold account.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   That's a book-a-month account.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   And your first month's free, your first credit is free.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   That means your first book is free.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   And it's yours to keep forever. You can't sell any time. You don't have to pay a penny.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   The Hobbit? That'd be a good one.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.800]   Andy's made some good recommendations for Hobbit dramatizations
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   as well as the full unabridged text.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   Both of those are on Audible.com.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.800]   Before I saw it, before you see Life of Pie, you got to read the book.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   The book is brilliant.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   And you don't want to spoil the book with the movie, trust me.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   Game of Thrones.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   Storm of Swords is coming up in March.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   Better start reading now. It's a long one.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.800]   What are you listening to these days, Andy?
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   Well, I'm kind of between books right now because I'm kind of stuck in holiday madness.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   The book that's on my Audible player right now is a repeat.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:50.800]   Stephen Tubilowski is the Dangerous Animals Club because I find his voice so wonderful.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   You're listening to that again. You just read it.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   I just, I finished that about a month ago, a month and a half ago.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   And it's like, the thing is, it stays in the player until you delete it or until you need space.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   Right. That's nice.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   And I found, and the thing is I just finished Kevin Pollock's wonderful book,
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.800]   which is also one of my favorite books of, audio books of this year.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   And so, okay, I'll skip around. I'll find one thing.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.800]   I've got this 45 minute drive and I'll just be, I've listened to my podcast,
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   I'll need something else. And before I knew it, I was like, okay, I guess I'm going to have to listen to the whole rest of this now
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   because it's just too good of a book.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   Isn't that nice?
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   One of the nice things about Audible is that book is yours forever.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:29.800]   So you have, if you use the Audible app on the iPhone, iPad, Android, even Windows phone, if you use the Audible app,
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   your whole library is visible.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   And you can read any book again, you know?
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   You can read down, you don't need to keep things in your iTunes library.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.800]   You don't need to keep things in your device.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   If you bought something three years ago, it's there in the library.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   You can read down a lot of that.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   Love, love, love that.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   Penny Marshall's kind of new book. My mother was nuts now.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   Oh God. I actually read that on Kindle.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   It was an interesting book, not a great book, but I can imagine that.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   That camp probably isn't a great book to listen to.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   Does she read it?
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.800]   Tell me the hand over my jewelry.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   I can't, I said, I'm doing a movie. I wore them on camera. I have to match in the shots.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   The exchange looks, and I suppose, just being helped.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   Well, you know, that's one of the things.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   I mean, you get a Kevin Pollock narrating his own. That's great.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   Exactly.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   When you get a, what's his name? I can never remember his name.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   Steven Tubalowski.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.800]   Steven whatever Tubalowski who you remember, he's a character actually.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   You'll recognize immediately.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   By the way, that is on my audible list to listen to next because I can't.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.800]   Your recommendation, I can't wait.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   If I were to pick my, as a matter of fact, just yesterday, I was looking through all the books that I listened to in 2012.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.800]   That by a nose that has to be my favorite, just above Kevin Pollock's book.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   Wow.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.800]   That's my favorite book of 2012.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.800]   Well, yes.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   Let's make that your audible pick of the week then, your favorite book.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   This could be like the look back at the best books of 2012.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   Look at the dangerous animals club.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.800]   We can whip out our Casey Kason voices.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   And now, counting down number eight on our audible.com 2012 hot 100.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   I'm going to put it right.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   You know, from Groundhog Day, you loved him in Boulder.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   So I'll show you right now how it works. So the dangerous animals club, there it is.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   I'm going to show you how it works.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak, audible.com/macbreak, it could be yours.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   If you want to just try it out, but you don't want to sign up, you don't want to subscribe
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   or anything like that, they have a free novella you can download just to see what it would
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   be like.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.800]   That is called Legion.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   It's really good by Brandon Sanderson.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   I'm sorry, Brandon Sanderson.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   It's available at audible.com/sanderson, even if you're an existing member, you can get
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:15.800]   that audible.com/sanderson, absolutely free.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   Thank you, Audible, for your support of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.800]   I think this is kind of cool.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   Patently Apple reports this, that the original startup chime is now a registered trademark.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   It's no drawing, it's a sensory mark.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   For computers, laptop computers, computer hardware, first use 1999, the smart consists of a synthesizer
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   playing a slightly flat by approximately 30 cents G-flat F-sharp major chord.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:54.800]   I love the description.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   Can you play that on your ukulele?
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   Slightly flat by 30 cents.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:00.800]   A slightly flat, I can definitely play it.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   G-flat F-sharp major chord.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   I wouldn't know how to begin to play that.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.800]   What are you...
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   Sorry, I thought that was it.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   Here it is.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   You want to see the tab?
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.800]   Oh, look at that.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.800]   There's the tab for it.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   Does it cover robots as well?
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.800]   Because the robot in Pixar have that chime.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   Wally's in a lot of trouble.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.800]   Did it?
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.800]   Really?
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.800]   The robot in Pixar had a startup?
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   Oh, in Wally, that's right.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   That's right.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   Let me play it.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.800]   This is the sound here.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   I just downloaded it to my...
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   Now I can...
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   What?
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   What's going on?
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   It has to come up through a two-inch paper cone speaker in the middle of a Mac+ cabinet,
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.800]   or else it's not the real startup chime.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.800]   I'm old school, man.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   I think I'm getting the wrong song here.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   Sounds...
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.800]   This is AM Kid Bay with it.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   I think it played and went on to the next one.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   Did it already go on to the next one?
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   He already did a remix of it.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   Bastard.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.800]   How quick does that happen?
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   I wonder what the title of it is.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   Fiona Apple?
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.800]   Recently added.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   Go to recently added.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.800]   It's 856-363-397.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   There you go.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   There's some other stuff going on in there.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.800]   I think that's the Mac 2 version of it though.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   What is it?
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   Yeah, what is it?
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.800]   The Mac 2 version had a lot more base to it.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.800]   There's the Mac+ ding.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   There was the first orchestral one.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   I think that was the Mac 2.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.800]   I remember being a little bit different for that.
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:42.800]   I'm trying to...
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.800]   Oh, God.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.800]   Unfortunately, when I think about the 80s, now I'm thinking about school.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   That was a very spandile ballet version of it.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.800]   This much is true.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   I know this much is true.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   So true.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   Funny how it seems.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.800]   Oh, it's in time.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   But never mind for dreams.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   And all the heat and tofu too.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.800]   This is the high...
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.800]   The high...
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.800]   The horn cowbell.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.800]   The horn cowbell.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   This is the sound.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   This is the sound of not much news over the course of the week.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.800]   Here, I'm playing it.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.800]   I'm playing it.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.800]   I'm playing it.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.800]   Now I've got to show...
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.800]   I don't like the way the Mac goes to the next song.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:38.800]   Stop it.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.800]   By the way, this is the new iTunes.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.800]   They've brought it back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.800]   You've missed it for such a long time.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:47.800]   You can now, once again, delete duplicates.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.800]   Show duplicate items is back in iTunes 11.0.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   Point one.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.800]   Yes!
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   Yes!
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   Nailed it.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.800]   Nailed it!
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.800]   The question was, why was it gone?
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   Time.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   They didn't enough time to shove all the features into the newly painted box so they shipped.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   I guess so.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.800]   They have the code like ready to go.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.800]   I mean, come on.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.800]   They just take a little chunk of code from the old iTunes.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.800]   The old duct tape wasn't holding.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   They had to get some fresh roll.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.800]   This is a feature that actually removes data from the library.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.800]   Maybe they're putting it through a little bit more.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.800]   There was a different sort of testing process.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.800]   Well, it doesn't delete it.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.800]   It just shows them.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   It's up to you to delete it.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.800]   You never did the deletion by it.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   You know how it doesn't delete it.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:33.800]   Huh?
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   No, I'm saying that the bad version deleted.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.800]   They had to hold out for a couple of weeks in there.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:39.800]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:40.800]   Maybe.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.800]   It's tired of reporting on rumors.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:47.800]   Now we're launching a few of our own.
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   Yes.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.800]   This is not a rumor, but I think Renee can actually be able to continue to create irresponsible
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.800]   rumors with one per week until we see our Apple TV.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:03.800]   I am.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.800]   I am.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   Renee, you're going to have to talk me down on this one.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   I am this close to deleting Instagram forever.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:09.800]   Oh, I did already.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:10.800]   I can't talk you down, Leo.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   You know, it reminds me of this Chinese proverb though.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.800]   You know that Chinese proverb with the monk in the scorpion or the snake where it says,
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.800]   "Carry me across the river."
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:21.800]   And you say, "No, you're going to sting me and I'll die."
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.800]   And he says, "No, no, I'll sting you."
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.360]   If that happens, then we'll both drown.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.360]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.840]   So you carry it across the river.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.680]   It stings you and you both start to drown.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.680]   And you say, "Well, why did you do that?"
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.520]   And it says, "Well, I'm a scorpion.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.040]   You knew what I was when you picked me up."
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   And social networks.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   It's in my nature.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.200]   Yeah, they have no business model.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:43.080]   Inevitably, you are the easiest and most valuable thing for them to sell.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.720]   And they have gotten a...some people think that they were bought for a million dollars
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.160]   by Facebook, but no, no, no, that was alone.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.200]   And Zuckerberg is sitting there with a baseball bat and they have to pay that money back.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   Right.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.080]   And this is the easiest way for them to do that.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:00.120]   So I'm going to tell you what the New Terms of Service, according to the New York Times,
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.680]   with the New Terms of Service say, "And you, ladies and gentlemen at home, can decide
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.240]   what you want to do."
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:12.160]   Instagram released an updated version of its privacy policy today or actually yesterday.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.160]   They'll go into effect.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.920]   You have till January 16th.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.360]   They will not apply to any pictures shared up to that date.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:22.120]   So this will be for new pictures uploaded from January 16th.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:27.920]   One, Instagram can share information about its users with Facebook, its parent company,
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.760]   as well as outside affiliates and advertisers.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.600]   I guess we knew that was going to happen.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.360]   Two, and this is the one that bugs the hell out of me.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.960]   You could star in an advertisement without your knowledge.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:44.320]   Instagram asserts, it says, "You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:51.280]   your username, likeness, photos along with any associated metadata and/or actions you
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:57.200]   take in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions without any compensation
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.880]   to you."
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:02.920]   What they don't say and what Facebook does that, but I think Facebook only shows it to
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.920]   my friends, right?
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.680]   Not yet.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:13.160]   Yes, but one of the complications is that this is somewhat in conflict with Facebook's own
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:14.760]   terms of service.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:20.320]   It says in two different places that they can't resell your content to other people's
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.000]   also that whatever license that they have to your content expires as soon as you remove
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   it.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.520]   So those are two things that would prevent it from selling it on in the way that people
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.520]   are fearing.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.920]   It's just such a compliment.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:40.640]   I think everybody knows that this is one of those results of people inside Instagram deciding,
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.840]   here's a feature that we want to add.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:47.600]   We want to be able to let other apps, third party apps license access to the Instagram
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:51.920]   stream and also put advertising on it if they want to do an ad supported app.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:55.320]   If we're going to start offering those services to third party developers, then we're going
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:59.880]   to have to make sure that our terms of service are amended to support pretty much any of
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:06.040]   anything that we're going to allow people to do to it as opposed to having a live stream
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:10.920]   and a billboard on Times Square of Instagram photos tagged with family running underneath
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:14.040]   some dodgy life insurance 800 numbers.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.240]   Well, that's what bothers me.
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:20.120]   Now, Neil, I Patel writing in the Verge said, no, look, this is not as big a deal.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.480]   This does not mean that Instagram can sell your photos.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.200]   I'm not sure I understand his logic.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:28.600]   He said Instagram is always like any web service that stores and publishes your photos
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:34.680]   had an expansive license to use and copy your photos.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.080]   It says Instagram can't sell your photos to anyone.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.320]   It simply doesn't have permission.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:42.400]   And Budweiser isn't allowed to crop your photo of a bar, slap a logo on it and run
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.440]   it as an ad on Instagram.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.720]   I was discussing it with Nilly on Twitter just before that article.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:51.360]   My issue is that that's a rational legal argument when you're dealing with emotional
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:52.840]   personal issues.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:58.080]   And if mom sees her photo in the Facebook sidebar in the context of a sponsored thing,
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:01.920]   it doesn't matter if there's no Budweiser logo on it or if it's been cropped or not.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:04.320]   She's still not going to understand the context of that photo.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.400]   Does he say that?
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:11.200]   Let's say you're here at the Brickhouse and I'm using a product and you take a picture
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.480]   of me and you post it on Instagram.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.400]   This happens all the time.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:20.680]   That company cannot take that picture of me using their product and put it in an ad.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.680]   They can.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.680]   Of course they can.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.280]   What are you saying is you can't sell it and doesn't matter if they sell it or not.
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.400]   I don't care if they sell it.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:32.360]   You're using my likeness to sell a product without my permission or compensation.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.360]   That's okay.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.360]   I've talked to a couple of different people, a couple of different lawyers over the past
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.400]   18 hours about this.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.520]   And there are two things that have come away with being convinced by.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.720]   Number one, that the language that's in this thing is needlessly, overly broad and would
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:49.440]   include a number of means of advertisements.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.000]   Again, I cited this idea of what if you have a moving billboard that simply, "Hey, look
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.600]   at these pictures I've just posted to Instagram about nice family moments."
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   And it could be a curated stream, but they could have that.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.800]   I don't want them using my pictures of my turkey.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.040]   It would not preclude them from doing it.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.640]   There's still be a lot of obstacles that I'm going to hurdle to do it.
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.800]   It may violate state privacy laws according to Mark Rotenberg of Ebony.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.680]   I mean, I'm saying, but in the broader sense.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.760]   In the limit, when people are talking about using your face, Leo, to promote a line of
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.920]   gold plated HDMI cables.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.240]   That enters an entirely different thing because you always have the exclusive right to your
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.040]   own publicity in terms of endorsements.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.240]   But Facebook already does Facebook not already do this with sponsored posts.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.680]   Leo LePorte likes Budweiser.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.720]   Don't they put a picture of me up there?
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.400]   Not drinking, but put a picture of me up there and say, "Leo LePorte's like, 'Buzzy, Robert
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.000]   scuba, that happens to him.'"
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   That's not necessarily the same thing.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.480]   If I were to say right here on this post, "Dike Dr. Pepper, available now in big gulp
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:02.760]   sizes at your local 7-Eleven," refreshing, the fact that they could say that I actually
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.560]   said that and use that as a, "Well, here's something that someone said in public we're
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.440]   simply passing along."
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.280]   Whether it could, there are ways to do that so that it does not run afoul of the, it does
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:23.000]   not construed as a professional endorsement or as product art or as logo art or as trademark
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   art.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.280]   Again, right now we're going into deep catalog of things that I've, we've gone from the field
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.160]   of things that I believe and understand to.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.240]   Now here's what I remember being told about a day ago when I was asking questions just
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   like this.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:41.360]   The point is that it's not cut and dry that Instagram could take user content and incorporate
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:49.200]   them into new advertising products and services that as Renee says, the user base might not
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.200]   like.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:55.000]   I mean, I don't want my face to be, even if it's just here's a picture that I took of
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.960]   the statue in a public park.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.360]   I hate these like loan scams you see so many times on an online advertising.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.960]   I just don't want any of my content to be used that way.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.160]   Even if it doesn't really refer to me, even if it's just using something from a stream
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.280]   which I happen to mention something, even though if it's part of a slideshow where they're
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.360]   just randomly taking content, I mean, it could be the stuff can be used in a way that the
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.720]   users wouldn't approve of.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:23.360]   However, as almost always happens when someone when the where we're poor language in terms
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.560]   of services made public, it turns out I also believe very, very solidly that Instagram
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.280]   is not taking the right to use this to use this stuff in a way that people fear.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.200]   I believe it's in a way to create new advertising products and services that are licensed through
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:44.840]   Instagram where incidentally, just just as Google needs the right to copy, transfer and
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:49.360]   duplicate your your your copyrighted work simply by virtue of the fact that they're not necessarily
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.280]   going to put it on a floppy drive and never keep never take it off that floppy.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.920]   They're going to be moving it around the server farm several times every 10 every every 10
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.920]   minutes.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.960]   They need their right to do that if they're going to be able to do that.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.000]   I need the right to do that and I gave them the right to that.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.360]   I don't want to give them the right to use my image in ads.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.360]   Google.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.240]   So it's an interesting dichotomy because there are some people who love the free is in Google
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.960]   model and they would they don't want to pay money.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:16.360]   So they're happy to pay in terms of attention or likeness or or any other of those rights
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.120]   that I personally don't want to give up.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.600]   I don't want to give up my location and my privacy and my my name and my content.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.800]   So I would rather pay money for this.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.040]   And I just think it's the thing with Instagram is that it's come across late in the user
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.040]   base cycle.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.040]   It's gotten very big.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.360]   They've gotten bought out and now it seems like in whether the old terms of service were
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.720]   similar or not, it's it seems like they're doing something that's a little bit dodgy and
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.280]   they don't communicate with their user base well.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.280]   So if there is a rational explanation, they're not out in front of the story.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:48.520]   They're letting all the news outlets report it in a way that might be scarier than it
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.520]   is.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.520]   I think it's completely scary.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.520]   Let me show you what Facebook's doing.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.840]   These are ads on my Facebook page.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.520]   Andy Walker used to work with him at call for help in Toronto.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.600]   He's Canadian.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:01.080]   He apparently at some point liked Tom Tom USA, which means Tom Tom could put an ad.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:06.760]   This is in the sponsored section, sponsored saying that Andy Walker likes Tom Tom puts
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.320]   a picture of Andy next to it.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.360]   These are the things I dislike.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.200]   Jesse Stay, who is an evangelist for Google+, but apparently wants everybody to use Facebook
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.880]   because it says Jesse Stay likes Facebook developers.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.840]   That's totally out of context.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:28.400]   That's being done in the context of I didn't know that Louis C.K. is playing in Boston
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.400]   next month.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.440]   A friend of mine has liked Louis C.K. because he said he's just bought tickets to it.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.760]   And Facebook wants to put that information into my timeline.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:43.560]   So yes, maybe it is advertising in the sense that even a ticket company can say, please
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.320]   put all mentions of ticket master products.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.760]   That example, because of course, Louis C.K. is using ticket master, but you know what
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   I mean?
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:56.080]   Anytime that one of you where a user's friends likes one of our products that's within our
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:00.280]   advertising portfolio, we want to pay you X sense per impression to put that into that
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.680]   person's stream.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:07.480]   It's not celebrity endorsement from Leo Laport endorsing Uncle Hoggi's Smokey Steak roles.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.600]   Well, I understand it's only my friends.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.240]   So Andy Walker is one of my friends.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.240]   You have chosen this.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.240]   But it's underspondered.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.760]   It says Andy Walker.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.080]   It says he's endorsing Tom Tom USA.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.440]   I know that it's a like that he pushed a like.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:23.200]   It makes me not, by the way, Scoble immediately went through all of his likes and removed
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.200]   most of them.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.200]   Right.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.200]   But that's the more.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.520]   Well, they're two of my least favorite services.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   That's Facebook and Instagram.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.520]   I mean, I really can't understand why they leave themselves open to this.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.520]   I mean, there's a kind of piece.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.600]   Because this is how they make money.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.600]   They want to do this.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.600]   I can understand.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:43.440]   Yeah, I can see what the terms of service for Instagram, how they handle it so badly
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.680]   and unseen this mad stamp.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680]   Okay.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.960]   Ready because listen, underage users are not exempt.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.120]   Although Instagram says people must be 13 years old to sign up for the service.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.180]   The new terms note, if a teenager signs up, they're agreeing that a parent or a girl
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:59.200]   guardian is aware that their image username or photos can be used in ads.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.200]   Boom.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.240]   Ads may not be labeled as ads.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.840]   This is something that's anathema in all media.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.720]   Another section of the updated terms, a company says ads will not necessarily be labeled.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:14.760]   Quote, you acknowledge we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content or commercial
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:22.200]   communications as such that alone is grounds for me to delete Instagram forever.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.620]   And by the way, you can opt out of this, you can just not use Instagram.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:30.220]   That's one of the reasons I hope iOS like Android just incorporates basic filter processing.
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.020]   People go to this because it's a value add.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.500]   Photography is a huge attraction.
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.420]   It's a huge way to stick people to your service.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.340]   It's why Facebook bought Instagram.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.620]   And if we just had baseline functionality in iOS, then I wouldn't have, if I decide I
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:46.180]   want to have a beautiful digital photo look like a kind of bad 1960s Polaroid with fringing
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.540]   effects and a square crop, I can do it in the iOS photo app and then I can choose to
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.460]   share that with Twitter or Facebook.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:56.900]   And I don't have to go to those apps for basic functionality.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:01.360]   So I understand that we're getting stuff free.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:08.640]   And in fact, I've been an advocate for people understanding that if you're the product and
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.340]   if you use Facebook or Google or any one of these free services or Instagram, there's
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.340]   ways to monetize.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:17.300]   But there's ways and ways showing me an ad is one thing.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:22.620]   Finding my image in another ad is another thing and not labeling it as a third thing.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:29.260]   So I'm not saying that, you know, I want Instagram to monetize.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.900]   You know, I pay for services.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.260]   Actually the guy who does a pin board and I can never pronounce his name so I'm not
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:34.760]   even trying.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.620]   But I love pin board because he charges up front.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.620]   He says, look, this is a paid service.
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.940]   Otherwise if it's not a paid service, I got to monetize you.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:43.540]   I don't want to do that.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:48.740]   And I think Facebook is, is, this is a stalking horse for Facebook.
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:53.620]   Facebook can do this to, on Instagram and see what the reaction is because who gets the
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:54.620]   heat?
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:57.620]   People, the Instagram Facebook and only peripherally.
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:00.460]   I think this is a stalking horse for something Facebook wants to do globally.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:03.980]   It has that Twitter stench to it too where you know, like Twitter needed developers.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:07.260]   It almost like it developers helped them go through college and then as soon as they
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.220]   became successful, they dumped them and got a, a hot new partner in advertising.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.780]   It's the same thing like you feel like you were creating all this great in content and
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.340]   being part of a social network.
[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:19.460]   And now that I have a certain size and they have to decide that they want to make money
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:22.740]   and your content becomes, actually you become the vehicle for them to do that.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:25.140]   So it feels a bit like something has changed.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:28.540]   The dynamic of the partnership has changed and Instagram has to realize that that dynamic
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.740]   changes for both sides.
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.300]   Well, it's a new company.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.300]   It's Facebook now.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:37.980]   I mean, there's a, not five minutes before I went downstairs to go to the studio here,
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:42.660]   I finished and sent a column about, about all this sort of stuff.
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:48.460]   And really at the end, I'm saying that what, what I think every user understands that
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:51.340]   a free service comes at a price always.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:57.300]   And we are begrudgingly willing for at least we're going to be complacent when a company
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:01.020]   decides that, well, we got to start rummaging through the sofa cushions for any bits of
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.140]   change we can because that kind of comes with a deal.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.300]   So it's, we're kind of okay with that when we realize it.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.100]   It's that, look, you know, those quarters, those dimes, they fell out of our pockets.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.740]   The fact that we didn't know that we lost them doesn't mean that you can't, you shouldn't
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:13.740]   just take them.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:14.740]   We're kind of okay with that.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:18.220]   Instagram, what they're doing is like they're sort of treating us like the sofa.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:22.380]   And that's the point at which we decided, Oh, no, let's, I'm going to, I'm going to
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.740]   block an unsubscribe immediately.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:26.100]   I mean, shaking us upside down.
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.260]   You don't want people rummaging through your pockets and your crevices trying to find as
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.460]   much money as they can.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:36.300]   Digging very digging, very, this is digging unusually deep for quarters and there, no,
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:39.780]   no, no, no, no, no.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:43.480]   I think that Facebook will do the same thing with this that they always do.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480]   This is, this is Facebook.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480]   This is so Facebook.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.180]   This is not Kevin's system.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.820]   This is Facebook there.
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:50.660]   And what they do is they do this.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.580]   And then there's the storm and they go, Oh, Oh gosh.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:54.580]   You're right.
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:57.740]   We're so sorry and they back off or not.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:02.780]   You know, I mean, and every time it's like gas prices, they get slowly higher and go
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.560]   down a little bit and you think it's, they violate your privacy.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:09.040]   They pull back, but each time they never quite pull back as far as they were originally.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.320]   Yeah, they'll just retweet the terms of service just to make it palatable to most people.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.240]   And then, you know, they found the middle ground and they found, you know, where they
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.560]   can actually do it.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.020]   And then as you say, you know, Facebook probably take the same approach.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:24.440]   The good news is that Flickr has improved their app considerably with, and given it some
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.120]   nice features.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.000]   Of course, I can't imagine what Yahoo will do as soon as people started using Flickr instead
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.300]   of Instagram.
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.740]   But at least there is a choice.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.740]   I can't cancel.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:38.360]   I would cancel Facebook too in retaliation, but I can't because I need to cover Facebook
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.360]   and use it.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.860]   I don't really need to cover Instagram and use it.
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:42.300]   I just do the barest minimum there.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.400]   I took all my photos down and I just have a bare account that I can use to test things.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.320]   I, you know, if not for the fact that I've nieces and nephews in college and that's the,
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.740]   that's their, that's their general mechanism of telling Uncle Andy and everybody else here's
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.000]   here's what I was doing last weekend.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.840]   I would not have any involvement in Facebook at all.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.240]   Well, I'm going to go review my Flickr, renew my Flickr pro account, give them some money.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.260]   It's like any company's efficiently large is indistinguishable from evil because their
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.900]   interest starts to diverge from yours to a greater and greater extent.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:08.900]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:12.460]   It's amazing the number of notifications I've been receiving from Flickr though, because
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:16.580]   I've kept my Flickr pro accounts and it's, it must be with a new app and the way the app
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:19.820]   will now search a Twitter followers and they can search for you as well.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.820]   I'm getting like 50 or 60 notifications every day.
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:23.820]   That's annoying.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:24.820]   Wow.
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:25.820]   Can you turn that off?
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.820]   I told her a couple of it.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:27.820]   It's send up with notifications.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:28.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:29.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:34.480]   I mean, it's, it's, there's always this, this tendency to for a company not to be satisfied
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.440]   with the fact that I use your service and I enjoy your service is let's see how far we
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.920]   can expand what we're getting from these people until they're so sick of us that they were
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:47.000]   considering dropping us for, for a while Twitter was when I was using the Twitter web app,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.920]   every header would say, did you know that, that MJ, MJ 41 two, your friend hasn't posted
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.920]   in six months?
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.280]   If you click this button, you'll sort of be, you'll, you'll send them a direct message
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.600]   to remind them they should be using Twitter more saying that would be a very good way
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:02.140]   to make sure that Mark never, ever, ever returns my phone calls ever again.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:04.680]   Saying they set up a posting on Twitter enough.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:09.920]   I set up a new account yesterday for a different show and I could not create the account.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.140]   I first had to choose five people to follow.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:16.120]   Then I had to choose five recommended people to follow and I knew enough to stop the page
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.120]   and go back to the main URL and go through it, but there's absolutely no next button
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:25.760]   until you go through Twitter's little process to get you into their system.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.360]   Is Timundus where you're going to say?
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.360]   Hey, hey, hey.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:40.960]   Apple, besides releasing iTunes 1101, which included fixes to airplane iCloud and duplicate
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:45.360]   item finding has released iOS 6.02.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.640]   What is new Renee Richie in 6.02 and should we immediately download it?
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.760]   Is it one of the security updates you gots to have?
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:57.040]   It is only as far as I understand for the iPhone 5 and for the iPad mini and it mainly
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:01.360]   fixes a Wi-Fi glitch that were causing problems to a percentage of the user base.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.360]   Good.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.000]   Because I see on my iPad 3 that it's up to date.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   That's good.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   That's weird though, isn't it?
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   They've only released it just for...
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.360]   I've never heard of them doing that.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.520]   No, it seems so now I'm going to...
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.240]   People have mixed back now 6.01 and 6.02.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.000]   It seems very strange.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.080]   They've done it rarely in the past when there were specific issues with certain devices
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.880]   and it's usually after the launch of a new device.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.880]   Right.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   Later on in the year, it doesn't happen.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.880]   The two new devices, aren't they?
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.560]   I wonder what the bug was.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.280]   My touch got always got free, which is interesting because that was also released around the same
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280]   time.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   Hmm.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280]   Instagram.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.200]   Unfortunately, the notes are very terse.
[01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:45.160]   They basically just say it fixes a Wi-Fi bug affecting some devices full stop.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.680]   By the way, you kind of called it Renee Richie.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.520]   Instagram just tweeted.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:54.880]   We've heard that the updates to our privacy policy in terms of service are raising a
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880]   lot of questions.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.280]   We'll have more to share very soon.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.000]   Exactly.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.480]   What we called.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.480]   They did...
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   Yeah, it...
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.480]   Unbelievable.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.680]   Four minutes ago.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:10.720]   It's like corporate communications is a lost art because it's so easy to get ahead of these
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.120]   sorts of things or to at least maintain a watch when you know you're about to do something
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.280]   that has historically been problematic.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:20.560]   But the amount of times that good products are destroyed by really poor marketing, it's
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.040]   kind of sad.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.720]   The responses are great too.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.240]   Yeah, more to share like our pictures.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.240]   For money.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.240]   And you better.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.160]   People are not going to use your service anymore.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.160]   Hope that's super soon.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.240]   You're losing your losers left and right.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.440]   Like maybe firing your lawyers and hiring ones that don't suggest you bend your customers
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.680]   over a couch and violate them.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.440]   By that time, lots of us will be gone by them.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.520]   I mean, there's a lot of...
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.960]   There's some flaming going on.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.040]   My couch analogy was much, much, much, much, much, much gentler.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.040]   I think so.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:59.080]   I didn't realize when you said the couch, what you were talking about there.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:04.560]   Apple has a new status page, which is you probably going to want to bookmark this for
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.160]   iCloud status and so forth.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:17.680]   The address is apple.com/support/systemstatus and it shows everything.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.480]   It's way more granular.
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.480]   Wow.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.720]   In fact, there's an issue with mail right now.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.920]   0.1% of users are affected, but everything else is green.
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.480]   And it is photo stream, iTunes store, bookstore, iTunes in the cloud match.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.480]   I photo...
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.600]   I mean, just amazing.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.560]   Mail may be slower unavailable than mail.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.560]   This is good.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.560]   This is one of the nicest...
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.360]   I don't like photos growing up.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.360]   Hopefully it is.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.280]   I know with my local ISP, they have a similar thing and whenever I have a problem with the
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.440]   service, I always go to their page and everything's always fine and it's not.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.480]   Yeah, they've got to actually be honest here.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.280]   That would work.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   I like this.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:02.280]   I am going to bookmark this right now and I guess everybody should apple.com/support/systemstatus.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:07.840]   This is your new, is it down for everyone or just me when it comes to Apple?
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:13.000]   That's awesome.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   Here's an interesting article in Fortune quoting Morgan Stanley who says that this is Katie
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.560]   Huberty writing for Morgan Stanley.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.960]   Another one of the man-less reports.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.520]   We've already qualified those in the past.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:33.800]   Despite concerns to the contrary, iPhone and iPad demand remain strong.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:39.360]   Despite our model drop next year, they said they thought the market would be saturated
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.840]   by now and apparently far from it.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:47.400]   33% growth year over year, iPhone 5.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.760]   iPad mini cannibalization concerns overblown.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.240]   40% of iPad mini purchases are new customers.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.640]   That's about the same as for the bigger iPads.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.800]   Apple holding its own against Samsung, rising Samsung share is at the expense of other Android
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.280]   smartphones and tablets, not iPhone.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:12.160]   And Apple clear winner during the holiday season tablets are the number one gift idea
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.160]   in consumer electronics.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.760]   It's here edging out e-readers.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.640]   Apple ranks highest among vendors at 38% up from 34% last year.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.000]   So that's a good report card for Apple.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   It's raining apples.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.400]   Google Maps is back.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:36.160]   That happened right after we closed the show last week.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.920]   Everybody happy?
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:38.920]   Ecstatic.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:46.040]   It's not a good thing for Apple Maps.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.200]   It's not just better.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.680]   It's like Apple Mawa.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.280]   Did Apple actually ship a Maps app?
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.280]   I don't know.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:58.000]   Except for when you use Siri and ask for directions, it launches Apple Maps still.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.400]   You can say transit at the end.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.080]   It'll go to Google Maps if that's the only transit app you have installed at the time.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.240]   Yeah, that's the little workaround.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.200]   But this still will give you transit directions then, though, right?
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.880]   In other words, you can't get driving directions that way.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   Right.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:12.880]   You have to switch over.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.560]   It's a nice preview because it now includes turn-by-turn directions, which you never had before.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:23.040]   The rumors are that that was one of the reasons why Apple pulled the Google Maps because Google
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.720]   wouldn't give them turn-by-turn directions.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.640]   And now they've been pulled from the device.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.720]   We've now got it as an app.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.760]   Not just turn-by-turn, but also vector-based maps.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.960]   So those really, really lovely maps are there.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.600]   Of course, the turn-by-turn directions are there, access to traffic is there.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:43.960]   And also, they've whipped up a really nice interface where when I first launched it,
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:47.920]   I thought that this was, okay, they've done this really cut-down version of it where it
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.800]   does the basic core functionality.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.200]   But I guess we'll see something better in the next three or four months.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.000]   It actually has the entire Google Maps experience.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.200]   But no, it's like they've hidden all the controls so that when you do a search and it gives
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.920]   you a search result, it's not just giving you a-- it doesn't put an extra--
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.560]   an extra button that says, okay, tap here in order to get directions.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:11.080]   It's actually printing it on a little sheet that you can then stroke in order to reveal
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.400]   more controls and reveal the Google Street view.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:18.440]   And man, this is something that any developer would be extremely proud of.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:25.040]   And if Apple Maps had been this, we'd be growing to the moon about how good an experience this
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.040]   is.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:31.960]   I mean, when I tweeted the link to my review of it last week, I said it's definitely good
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:36.280]   enough to banish your-- the most controversial thing it turns out that I've written possibly
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:40.000]   in the past three months has been saying that it would banish Apple Maps to page two of your
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   springboard.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.840]   And people immediately said, no, no, I'm banishing it to the folder of apps I hate but get delete.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:49.880]   Yeah, it goes right there with the Apple stock app, the Apple weather app.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.280]   I have a whole bunch of Apple apps.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.920]   I know news.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.440]   It is the number one, immediately.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.080]   Within seven hours, the number one free iPhone app.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.400]   You know, although I was just perusing this list of free apps, some of them I, you know,
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:05.920]   iTunes 12 days of Christmas sure, Office Mac, Mac's Elf Yourself's number three, Angry
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:11.000]   Bird Star Wars, that's number four, YouTube number five, number six in the top free iPhone
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.840]   apps, nose surgery, number seven, Gangnam Dance Boost.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:19.440]   What does that say about us as a society Leo?
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.360]   I'm depressed.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.840]   I'm depressed.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.840]   Are you?
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:29.160]   There's a game called nose surgery.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.560]   Also known as Angry Cardashians.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.760]   Anyway, but it is.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.240]   I love Greek Kardashians.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:40.600]   I think we have a show title.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.600]   We have a winner.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.800]   It brings up an interesting issue.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.640]   I never doubted that Apple would approve the Google Maps app as soon as it appeared.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:55.840]   I think at this point, I don't think that Apple denies apps based on competition, based
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.080]   on for tactical reasons.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:02.280]   But the question is now that we, this isn't the first time that we come up with the issue
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:07.480]   of Gee, I really wish that a different app were installed as the default to receive certain
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:08.480]   requests.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:14.000]   Are we, do you think that maybe in iOS seven, iOS eight, at some point, would Apple install
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.960]   preferences so that I could make Google Maps the default navigation app so that anytime
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:23.000]   I ask Siri, please route me from A to B, it will pass the request launch of this app
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.160]   instead of the other one.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:29.000]   Will it be possible to install a third party mail app and make that the default mail app?
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.320]   That would be, that would be the point.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.960]   That would be, that would be an interesting point in the development and sophistication
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]   of iOS.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.520]   I could, you know, I would use Gmail as my default.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.400]   I would use Chrome as my default browser.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.400]   I would use Google.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.400]   I mean, it's actually a bunch of Google apps I noticed.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.400]   Yeah, God.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:44.400]   They might.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.400]   It's quite bad.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.400]   I think Leo.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.240]   My pick of the week is another Google app.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.240]   We'll get to it later.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:54.320]   But it's like, oh, that's for the limited things that I use this feature for.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.800]   That is actually better than the Apple service.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   Oh, dear.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:01.800]   You know that with the answer from Apple PR would be, and you said, it's on our list.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:02.960]   We're looking at a lot of things.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.480]   We don't know when we're going to get to it yet.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.720]   And then when you actually get it, it'll have everything you want except for one app.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.000]   Like mail won't be there or browser won't be there.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.840]   Just to keep you on your toes.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840]   Right.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.840]   Yes.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.360]   You pointed out that ActiveSync is gone, but that only affects Windows phone users.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.240]   No, so it's active sync.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.720]   You'll no longer be allowed to add ActiveSync to a new connection.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.720]   So if you get a new phone, unless you have a paid Google account, you're in the military.
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.040]   You're in education.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.760]   And there's one or other little caveats.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:35.240]   But for an average Gmail user, when the iPhone 5S comes out and you try to add Gmail over
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.560]   ActiveSync, it'll say, no, no, we're sorry.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.960]   We have this lovely, if incredibly frustrating, iMap service that you might want to enjoy
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.960]   instead.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.760]   Oh, boy.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.200]   So yeah, it's a little bit of a.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.680]   And I don't use a Gmail app because I have multiple provider accounts and I want the
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:50.680]   unified inbox.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:55.800]   And now I have to choose between unified inbox or Gmail push and the Gmail account.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.280]   I actually, yeah, that's the reason I use Gmail is because that's my unified inbox.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.280]   Everything go to Gmail.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.440]   And then the Gmail app works really nicely.
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.440]   I have too many errors.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:08.760]   I get simultaneous connection errors and bandwidth errors and inbox can't be found errors.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.720]   So I have to start forwarding Gmail to other accounts.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.160]   I'm precluded from using that.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.000]   That might be a Canadian thing.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.160]   Well, I think that they have low limits for a company the size of Google.
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.160]   I think you're allowed 16 simultaneous connections.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:26.640]   And if you start having a lot of devices logged in at the same time, especially the way Apple
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:30.920]   Maps is very Apple Maps hits a lot of connect-- sorry, Apple Mail hits a lot of connections
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:31.920]   at once.
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.200]   And you can have a couple of computers going, a couple of mobile devices.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:37.960]   You can start hitting those limits quickly.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:44.240]   We're going to take a break and come back with the best of 2012 from iTunes, iBooks,
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:48.240]   all of the above iTunes, iBooks, App Store.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.680]   What are the number one apps of the year?
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.640]   And then we'll also get your picks of the week.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:58.600]   But before we do that, let's talk a little bit about our friends at Ford.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:06.520]   What an amazing-- I just found a taker for my Mustang.
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.520]   No Chad, you don't get it.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.520]   What?
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.520]   Lisa wants it.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:14.240]   Because I'm getting the new Ford Fusion.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:15.240]   I'm so excited.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.400]   Now it's not quite out yet because I'm getting the plug-in hybrid.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.120]   If you go to Ford.com/technology, you can find out about all the new technologies they're
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.440]   putting in these new cards.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:31.640]   I would say the 2013 Taurus, the 2013 Ford Fusion, these are going to be the leading edge
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   cards.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.160]   But eventually all these technologies are available in all of the vehicles.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:41.680]   Things like Bliss, the Blind Spot Information System, that's really amazing.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.520]   It has sensors in the rear of your car that keeps an eye on the blind spot.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:50.520]   Every car has a blind spot, that area you can't see in the mirrors as a car comes up
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.760]   on you.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.760]   And it will see the light.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.640]   It shows that there's somebody there and there's an audible tone.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:01.640]   So you never have to worry about merging into oncoming traffic, even if you can't see it.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.240]   That is amazing technology.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.960]   They also use the same sensors for cross-traffic alert as you're pulling out of a parking
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960]   space.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.520]   If there's big vehicles on either side, you kind of have to edge out because you can't
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.160]   see.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.440]   It can see more than you can.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:17.600]   So it'll let you know if there's oncoming traffic as you're pulling out of a parking
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.800]   space.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:25.720]   Also and I need this active park assist, which actually is the closest thing you're going
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.920]   to get to an autonomous vehicle and a mainstream vehicle today.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:29.920]   You're driving along.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:30.920]   I use this in the Flex.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:31.920]   It was so cool.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.040]   It says, find me a parking spot.
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.520]   As you're driving along, it looks at all the free spaces, measures them.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.840]   When one is the right size, it alerts you.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:43.800]   It says, I got it, pull forward and let me take control.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:48.880]   So you do and you take your hands off the wheel and keep your foot on the brake and
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.680]   then it actually parks for you.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:59.320]   The wheel goes, in 24 seconds, perfect parallel parking.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.800]   This is the closest thing to autonomous.
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.720]   I mean, this right there, this is a car that does a better job than you ever could.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.280]   Just the right spacing from the road.
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.120]   It's perfect.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.920]   I think you got to take a look at this.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.000]   Why don't you go to your Ford dealer, say I want to see the active park assist, the
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.920]   Bliss on a 2013 Ford Fusion or a 2013 Ford Tourist or visit Ford.com/technology.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.800]   Find out about that, the Sync, the Push button.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:30.560]   Start the amazing Eco Seats, the EcoBoost engine and go on and on.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.560]   This stuff that they're putting in these cars is amazing.
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:42.240]   The inflatable rear safety belts, really great for kids and small people.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.720]   The adaptive cruise control, all of this.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.440]   It's going to be all in my new car.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.440]   I'm so excited.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.320]   And of course, I love my Ford Sync.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.320]   Ford.com/technology.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.780]   Learn more.
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:57.840]   Go further in a Ford and I will be interviewing and we'll put this on our specials feed at
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.600]   CES, people from Ford.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.640]   Alan Malali is not available, unfortunately.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.640]   I'm disappointed.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.920]   He's having a dinner, but I'm going to miss that I think.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.200]   But I will talk to Paul Macarenes who is, Ms. Carranis who is the CTO and Prisca, who
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:16.480]   runs their Silicon Valley Bureau.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:22.560]   We'll put that on the specials feed June, June, June, January 8th, I think.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.560]   All right.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.560]   Let's take a look.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.560]   The best.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:33.400]   I'm going to launch the new iTunes.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.160]   Have you guys reviewed these yet?
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.600]   Have you checked out the best of 2012?
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.680]   I think for apps.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.680]   Dave's on.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:44.720]   I'll fill your face in podcasting, Leo.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.720]   Is podcasting?
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.720]   Is there somebody I know?
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:47.720]   Yeah, there's somebody you know.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.560]   I am glad to hear that that Chris Hardwick is doing so well.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.560]   I got it.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.560]   I got it now.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.560]   I got it.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.360]   Very good download.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   The number one app is one that you picked Andy as a pick of the week, day one, which
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.680]   is a it's kind of an interesting choice actually.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:11.480]   It's kind of a specialist program, but it is beautiful.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.680]   It's a journaling program that not only is an app, it's also a desktop app as well as
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:19.320]   a iOS app.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.920]   Why do you like it?
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:26.760]   I just like it because there are a lot of I don't really journal, but there are a lot
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.080]   of little projects which I just need to maintain a certain schedule where I'm going to be writing
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:34.960]   a certain thing or producing a certain thing every single day or an irregular schedule.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:39.600]   There's nothing that keeps you on schedule better than simply pulling up a calendar and
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:45.200]   seeing okay, it has been four days since you've created anything or with this project that
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.200]   you're on.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:50.840]   So it's so I mean there are a couple of different projects where I actually do have what you
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.240]   use the Unix calendar command to print out an entire year calendar on which single street
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.960]   of paper on my fridge right now.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.080]   There are like four of those where with a Sharpie marker for one for each different
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.080]   project.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:05.920]   So every morning when you know I get my get my morning morning, morning can of Budweiser
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.800]   light, I can see that okay I have here's here's how many days have gone by without a red dot
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.000]   on this certain day.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.120]   It really makes it very, very clear that here are the days in which you added something
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:18.120]   to this project here are days in which you did not add something to the project.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:21.920]   So it's just such a way good way to sort of keep the creative juices flowing and keep
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:22.920]   yourself on schedule.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:27.960]   I wish that they would add multiple calendars, multiple schedules, multiple projects even
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:31.720]   if it were creating a second app that was a little bit more complicated than day one
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:37.120]   for that for that kind of project work because as is it's such a simple easy way to get
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.800]   a daily journal going or daily anything going.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:48.520]   This game of the year Deus Ex, I'm going to have to check that out.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:53.600]   I have to say now day one was ten bucks Deus Ex is forty dollars so this is the ultimate
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.960]   edition human revolution.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.880]   Have you played this chat Jadzer resident?
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:58.880]   I have gamer.
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:29:59.880]   It's really good.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.880]   I haven't played it on the Mac.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.440]   It was a PC game for a long time.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.760]   It was a first person shooter.
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.600]   But it's really cool that you can buy that in the app store.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:12.480]   Yeah, and it should work just fine.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.040]   Very positive customer reviews on this too.
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:19.760]   It's a five star winner, Apple Design Award winner.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:25.440]   Deus Ex the game of the year, then the runner's up camera bag to splice the tree of life.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.920]   Tweetbot, sketchbook, clear.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.840]   These are all great apps.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:34.160]   Lightroom, things, mint.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:39.520]   It looks as though the UK store we've actually got some different apps in the app and game
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.520]   of the year.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.320]   We've got day one as the app of the year and Lego Batman 2D as the game of the year in
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.320]   the UK.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:46.320]   That's interesting.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:52.760]   Yeah, it's always different internationally.
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.600]   I have podcasts pulled up over here.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:55.600]   Let's see.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.600]   So you got...
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.600]   Tedd is editor's choice.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.800]   Best audio podcast, Adam Corolla.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.600]   No, don't go back.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:08.480]   Let's give the guys the best video podcast, Sesame Street, best new video podcast, mini
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.480]   minute physics.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.040]   Minute physics.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.720]   That's cool.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:13.720]   That's cool.
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.520]   So we're not in the best, but we're in the technology.
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:17.240]   What's your good technology?
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:21.600]   And tech guy, Callie Lewis and Gadget.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.320]   Best new technology before you buy.
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:25.320]   That's good.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.400]   So we've got a couple of them in there.
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:32.560]   You know, we've been around so long that we're not going to generally get in the best stuff
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:35.520]   because it'd be boring.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.280]   Although I think that those are all good choices.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:44.160]   Best artist, Frank Ocean when it comes to music.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.920]   Best iPhone app of the year, action movie FX.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.360]   That's fun.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.520]   Love that.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.960]   Best iPhone game of the year.
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:52.960]   I don't know why this is...
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:53.960]   Oh yeah.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:54.960]   Rayman Jungle Run.
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.520]   Love that.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.360]   Blockbuster movie of the year, The Avengers.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:02.040]   This is good.
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.320]   Breaking Bad Best TV Show.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:07.240]   I'd agree with all of these.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:10.200]   iPhone app of the year paper.
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:14.400]   I'm sorry, the iPad app of the year paper by 53 beautiful drawing app.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:17.800]   I really, really like paper.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.680]   But it looks like it's free, but it's not because you have to basically pay for the
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:22.680]   pens.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.120]   So it's really $6.99 for everything.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.080]   But that's still a good deal.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.680]   If I were an artist, I would really like it, but I'm not.
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:32.960]   Best iPad game of the year, this is wonderful.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:36.160]   My son solved this on my iPad.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.160]   I tried.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.960]   It's kind of, if you like, missed, you'll love the room.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:44.560]   Beautiful, beautiful game, puzzle game.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.240]   Agree with that.
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:49.840]   Let's see, Best Artist, Frank Ocean.
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.480]   Best album, Risley Bear Shields.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.480]   Best song.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.480]   Very young.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:58.880]   That was also the number one, and Zeitgeist, I think the number one song.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.720]   Breakthrough album, The Lumineers.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.040]   Best director, Moonrise Kingdom.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.040]   I'd agree with that.
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:05.680]   I love Wes Anderson.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.320]   Best Discovery Beasts of the Southern Wild.
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:09.400]   I haven't watched that yet, but I've got to.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:14.520]   Hunger Games, Best Star Making Performance, Best Novel, The Dog Stars.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.520]   These are all makes sense.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:20.880]   I a little hurt that we're not in Best Audio Podcast, but Adam does a great show.
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.280]   So that's okay.
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:26.880]   I can't say, Sesame Street beats you in the podcast category.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.880]   You can't really.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:28.880]   You can't complain about that.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.880]   You can't compete with Elmo.
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.880]   No.
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   If you're going to be spiteful about not beating Sesame Street, you need to watch more Sesame
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.440]   Street.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:44.880]   I'd agree with their pick for Best Episode, Homeland Season 1.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:49.280]   I don't know what episode it is, but that is a great...
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.720]   They just completed their second season.
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.880]   I'm going to blockbuster that as if you haven't watched that.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.640]   Claire Daines, oh, The Weeknd was the one, the best episode I...
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:33:59.640]   What is that?
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.640]   The Weeknd.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.600]   Episode 7, Season 1.
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.840]   Carrie and Brody spend a weekend in the countryside.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.440]   Who could forget?
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:10.160]   Now it's time for our picks of the week.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.360]   We'll start over on my right here with Renee Ritchie of iMore.com.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.360]   Renee?
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.360]   Can I go after Don?
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.520]   Because I'd like to give a hearty endorsement to his pick this week.
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:19.520]   Okay.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.520]   And with Don McAllister of Screen Gas, online.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.040]   Okay, Doki, well, my pick is...
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.160]   I mean, I love my iPad.
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.440]   I love the iPhone.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:31.480]   But I do find there are limitations, especially with the lack of multitasking.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:37.920]   And I'm so wedded into visiting websites that need login information, that I tend to
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.000]   do very little browsing.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.720]   I do lots of RSS reading, but I don't really visit the websites.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:49.160]   I normally visit from a business on the iPad until one password for iOS has come out.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:53.960]   Because I've got tons and tons of login credentials stored in one password on my Mac.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.920]   And we've had one password for iOS before and they used to synchronize.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:01.920]   But the thing with one password before the new version was that it was only a single
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:02.920]   browser.
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:08.720]   So if I had to jump between, well, my membership system and my support system, et cetera, I
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:11.360]   had to sort of completely log out and log back in again.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.360]   It was a mess.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:17.920]   They've now included a tabbed browser built into one password on the iPad and the iPhone.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:18.920]   And it's fantastic.
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:23.440]   And now log into multiple sites using your one password credentials and just a tab between
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.440]   them.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.160]   It's really just speed up my productivity now.
[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.760]   So and they've completely redesigned it.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.400]   It's beautiful.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.440]   Lots and lots of new features in there as well.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:37.200]   It syncs with iCloud for iOS devices and Dropbox as well as before.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.720]   And they also include favorites now as well, which is another boon.
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.680]   Again, there are four or five websites I need to visit regularly.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.440]   I can store them in my favorites.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:49.720]   Open Mintab browsers use my one password credentials to login and I'm happy as Larry.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.000]   So that's one password iOS.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.840]   Can you compare it to LastPass?
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:58.320]   You know, I can't because I've never used LastPass.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.880]   So I'm not too sure.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.360]   I need to check it out really.
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.160]   But I've got so much invested in one password because of all the login information I've
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:10.040]   collected over the, I've never really used that particular application.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.760]   And you and you hardly endorse this.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.520]   I mean, they're Agile Bits is a fantastic company.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.760]   They go above and beyond all the time.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.640]   I mean, if you bought in the last month, they are, they're doing their best to make
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.800]   sure that you don't have to pay again for the new app.
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:27.080]   It's on sale half off for every user because Apple doesn't allow upgrades.
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:30.720]   And Guy English and I actually spent an hour and a half interviewing Dave Tier, who's one
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.600]   of the co-founders and we'll have that up later in the week.
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:39.000]   But the amount of consideration and thought that they put into every bit and every pixel
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.800]   of this app was just astonishing, so I'm a huge, huge fan of this app.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.800]   And your pick?
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:50.600]   My pick is actually, it's something called the Transit app and it's got an interesting
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.600]   story.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.880]   It's actually an app that was made in Montreal and it was just to get around the local buses
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.480]   and metro system.
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:00.560]   And then iOS 6 came out and didn't have transit directions.
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:04.400]   So Apple became very interested in apps that did transit.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.000]   Now their app wasn't ideal because they didn't do a lot of trip planning.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.400]   But just today they've updated to version 1.5 and they've added support for I think 28
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.720]   cities now, dozens and dozens of different transit authorities.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.400]   It's got trip planning.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:24.160]   The app is free and you get one route and I think you can plan one trip.
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:29.240]   You can also subscribe to the app and then you get unlimited alternate routes and multiple
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.520]   trip planings and it's a beautifully designed app.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:38.680]   It's a little bit like a metro style Windows 8 app, very nice typography and it works incredibly
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.520]   well in almost every major city now.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.920]   Cool.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.360]   How much?
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.840]   It's free for the basic functionality and you can subscribe to a pro version that just
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:54.800]   gives you multiple options within the app, like multiple routes or multiple trip plans.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.000]   Cool, very good.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.560]   Your pick my friend, Mr. Andy Inako.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:06.600]   This actually ties into Instagram of just great timing just a few days before the Instagram
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.600]   kerfuffle.
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:14.960]   Flickr finally released the first really good version of their own app for iOS and for Android.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.920]   This is such a great little app.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:25.120]   If I've got it actually here on the screen here behind me where what they've done here
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:27.760]   is they've released the app they should have released about three years ago.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.360]   If Flickr had released this version, I don't think Flickr Instagram would have had such
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.960]   a need to exist.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:38.720]   It's intensely multi-touch, a touch designed app.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:39.720]   You've got just two tabs.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:42.720]   Here's photos from your contacts, photos from your groups.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:47.600]   Each one of these groups here is a bird lovers, the strobis side, the HDR side and you don't
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.800]   have to drill deep.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:53.800]   This is a very, very modern design app where every single one of these can now scroll up
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:58.880]   and down between groups but now I can scroll side to side to look at individual photos.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:00.120]   Then you just give it a tap.
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.200]   I'm afraid that this is going to be a little bit slow because I don't have really good
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.760]   Wi-Fi here in the studio.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:11.720]   Of course, I'm not connected to Wi-Fi here on the phone but it makes it so easy to finally
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:17.280]   just maneuver around and discover and enjoy the photo and just see what's going on in
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.920]   all these groups that you follow.
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:21.480]   Also you can take pictures directly from the app.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:25.200]   It's a really, really nice little camera app but all the different features that you'd
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:28.240]   want to have right there up front.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:33.840]   You can post directly from there into Flickr and it's really changed the way that I interact
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:39.080]   with Flickr almost immediately because Flickr used to be the thing that I would use to
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:44.480]   post photos after I'd taken them from the phone or from my camera and put them into
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.760]   aperture and uploaded them and tweaked them.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.360]   Now it really is more of a social network.
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:55.280]   I really am interested in when I've got those three minutes to spare when I'm waiting for
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.280]   a bus or a train.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.040]   Let's just see what's going on on Flickr.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:02.800]   When I take a picture, then sort of instinctive thing is not to simply take the snapshot and
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.600]   then post it to Twitter from there.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:08.600]   But I just want to take it here, annotate it in Flickr.
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:13.800]   It will automatically tweet out a link to the picture that you just posted onto Flickr.
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:16.760]   Just a solid, solid, solid app all around again.
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.760]   Really beautiful.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.080]   If this had been released three years ago, I'm not even sure that Instagram would have
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:23.080]   gotten a toehold.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:28.040]   Although they did make one tactical error, yes, you can have those horrible, horrible
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.480]   tea stained Instagram filters.
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.560]   If you must ruin your pictures, go ahead and ruin them.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:39.760]   They'll leave it up to you, although good taste commands you to not do that.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.960]   Actually, the filter, you hit the nail on the head.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:47.080]   It must be extremely frustrating to Yahoo employees who knew that this was capable.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.160]   They were capable of this.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.400]   They never put it on an iOS app.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.200]   Instagram came and stole their lunch.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:59.640]   The timing is good because with these Instagram changes in their TOS, I think this is an opportunity
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:01.440]   for Flickr.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.880]   I'm immediately moving to Flickr.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.920]   I wasn't, it's funny because I had let my pro account, which is cheap.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:12.880]   It's two years, 45 bucks, 27 bucks for one year.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.200]   I had let it at laps because I thought, "Flicker's dead."
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.880]   With the advent of this app, I gave them my money.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.680]   I signed up for the same thing.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:25.800]   Flickr has remained, I think, the best service for if you really like sharing photos, if you
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:30.760]   really like archiving photos, I always thought that Flickr was the best game in town, particularly
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:34.800]   because it gave you so many entry points and so many sharing points from that service.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.320]   I'm just glad that now it's relevant in mobile space yet again.
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.280]   By the way, I'm playing with it on the iPad.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.520]   It's an iPhone only, although I imagine they'll do an iPad update.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.760]   Even on the iPad, it's fine.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:49.560]   It's great using the iPad camera and everything.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.120]   I think this is going to be a huge hit.
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.440]   I can't wait to see an iPad version of this.
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:55.440]   Well done.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.400]   I was going to send a nice Christmas card to Instagram this year.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.400]   Bye.
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:00.400]   Bye.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:01.400]   Bye.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:02.400]   Bye Instagram.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:03.400]   Nice knowing you.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.400]   Hackett at Facebook.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.400]   What?
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:12.200]   Who sent us a spiral bake honey ham with this red and purple dot on it?
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.040]   Really just fantastic.
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:19.280]   All the settings and everything are great.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:21.960]   I think they've just done a die in my job.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:24.960]   This is the app they should have done two years ago.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.520]   A good pick.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.520]   I am.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:31.120]   My pick is light bulbs.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:33.480]   Hugh is here.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:36.440]   I'm going to actually review this for before you buy it.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:39.440]   I won't go through a big long review of it.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:46.720]   Now it's not cheap, but Philips has more and more people are buying LED bulbs than ever
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.560]   before.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.320]   Hugh is an LED bulb system that has an interesting slant on it.
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.600]   First of all, they've got the LED bulbs now where they look like real light bulbs.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:59.600]   No more weird fins or heat sinks or everything.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:02.600]   Philips has a new technology for keeping them cool.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:06.000]   What's interesting about these is there are GB light bulbs.
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.800]   It means they're LEDs, but there's red, green and blue in here, which means that you can
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.040]   control the color 100%.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:20.520]   This is the starter kit of Hugh, the Hugh personal.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:21.840]   What are you laughing at?
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:26.920]   No, no, I'm just imagining that scene where you bring the date home.
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.160]   You go this app on your iPhone.
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.000]   It's exactly what you do with it.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.440]   All the faults go red.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.160]   It's exactly like exactly what you do with it.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:38.800]   I just thought you'd like to see Game of Thrones.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:44.200]   That's just telling me I've got new tweaks with it.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.400]   I think this is 300.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.720]   I can't remember off to look up the present.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.720]   I think it's $300.
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:52.000]   Is it $300, Shannon, for the Hugh starter kit?
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.680]   You get this Wi-Fi thing.
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:55.680]   How much?
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:56.680]   200.
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:57.680]   Well, that's not bad.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:01.880]   You get three light bulbs and the base station, which can control many more light bulbs.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:06.200]   The base station hooks up to your ethernet.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:07.200]   Then you link the bulbs.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.200]   It's kind of like Sonos.
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:11.280]   You link the bulbs to the base station.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.560]   You can buy more bulbs.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:17.040]   Then you can make the Hugh any color you want.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.640]   That's what's kind of interesting about you.
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:22.520]   They have an iPhone, Android, and iPad app.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:28.840]   What Hugh does is it has some pre-programmed things like relaxation, reading, concentration.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.480]   You can take any image and say, "I want this color for that bulb, this color for that
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:34.480]   bulb."
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.480]   You know what?
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:36.480]   It works.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.720]   It's the strangest thing you've ever experienced.
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:40.480]   Your room can feel like a sunset.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.920]   You could take a picture of Greece.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:44.440]   You know how the light is kind of unique in Greece?
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:48.120]   You could take a picture of Greece and then say, "With each bulb, which part of that
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:49.880]   picture that bulb's color will be?
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:53.200]   It duplicates that color exactly."
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:54.760]   Then that's the light you've got.
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:56.320]   The reading light is...
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.840]   They have a light for waking up that is daylight.
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:00.360]   It's perfect daylight.
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.760]   They have a light for relaxing, which is very yellow and warm.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:07.360]   Now, admittedly, it's a little expensive.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:09.400]   200 bucks for three light bulbs.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:16.440]   But remember, these are LED bulbs, so they go for a long, long time.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.360]   Does it work with your iTunes library?
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:21.680]   I would definitely buy these if it senses that, "Oh, he's playing Avatar.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.280]   Let's switch all the lights in the room to blue."
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:26.280]   He's playing Barry White.
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.280]   That'd be cool.
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:28.280]   That'd be cool.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.560]   Wouldn't it be cool?
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:34.440]   One of the things that it does is you can change the lighting when you're away.
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:37.280]   You can go on the website and remotely control your lights.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:41.880]   There's a program ability, so you can say, "After 7 p.m., I want it to be like this."
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.520]   In the morning, I want it to be like this.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.200]   You can set a schedule.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:50.880]   They have light recipes, which is kind of wild.
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:55.200]   You can create a light recipe arbitrarily.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:59.720]   It starts with the four basic ones, "Relax, Concentrate, Energize, and Reading."
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:02.720]   By the way, even those, these are not dimmable LED bulbs.
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:05.000]   You can get dimmable LED bulbs.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.240]   These are not dimmable LED bulbs, but they can be dimmed via the application.
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:12.320]   You actually have a lot of control of the brightness of the bulbs.
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:16.560]   Every setting, every color, every hue has a different brightness level all the way up
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:19.240]   or all the way down.
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:24.680]   These are 8.5 watts, 600 lumen, 15,000-hour bulbs.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:29.600]   15,000 hours means you'll be dead before these bulbs stop working.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.920]   It's like buying a turtle.
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:33.520]   You will not outlive this purchase.
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.760]   You can buy individual bulbs as well.
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.520]   I don't know how many control.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.480]   I have it controlling four bulbs in my downstairs.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.320]   It works really well on the track lighting.
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:49.200]   That's a nice way to use it if you have inset or track lighting.
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:52.320]   Basically, because it's RGB, there's no color.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.000]   It can't do.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:00.240]   You can do 50 bulbs at a time.
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:02.480]   Basically you can have a rock concert with this thing.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:03.480]   These are bright.
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.880]   I mean, 600 lumen is pretty bright.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:11.400]   I have to say I'm very impressed.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.960]   It is pricey.
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:18.920]   The three bulbs started back, as I said, 200 bucks on the Apple store, by the way.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:22.560]   They are available to ship now.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.560]   Then you can get...
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:24.880]   You can't put a price on Geekleo.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:27.000]   60 bucks per bulb, which is...
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000]   Now it's a decent price.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.560]   I remember LED bulbs were 100 bucks.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:31.960]   There's time starting to see 30 buck bulbs.
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:33.440]   I imagine the price will go down.
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:35.840]   But 60 bucks for a bulb that doesn't burn out.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:40.720]   I mean, 15,000 hours is a long, long time.
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.720]   How many years?
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.320]   That's leaving it on for 1.7 years.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:48.160]   Or triple that if you're going to leave it on an average of eight hours a day.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.480]   You're talking a good long time before you have to replace that bulb.
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:56.080]   I think in the long run it may not be cheaper than incandescent lighting.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.520]   But I bet you it's pretty...
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:00.840]   It's not much more considering the power, the low power.
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.400]   These are only 8.5 watt bulbs and quite bright.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.640]   Oh, another feature I liked.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:09.000]   I was a little worried.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.920]   I thought, "Oh, now I'm going to have to turn on the lights through my iPhone."
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:14.200]   No, the light switch still works.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:15.600]   You could turn off the lights and the light switch.
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:20.000]   When you turn it on, they reprogram to full brightness.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.600]   You don't have to worry about...
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.240]   Kind of turn on the lights and see something.
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:24.840]   It'll turn on to full brightness.
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:27.920]   The one negative I found, and I think this is probably a software glitch that they'll
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:32.720]   fix, is that when you add new bulbs, by the way, adding bulbs means you actually have
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:33.720]   to add them in software.
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:37.080]   You have to say, "I've added a new bulb and added to the bulb."
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.200]   Can your bulbs crash, Leo?
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.200]   Do they reboot?
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.200]   So far, no crashes.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.600]   The blue room of death.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.600]   So far, no.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.440]   But the new bulb, you have to add to your color recipes.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:51.240]   So the recipes are designed for the starter kit 3 bulbs.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.960]   So one by one, if you had 50 bulbs, you'd have to go through and add them all one by
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:55.960]   one.
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.960]   That's a little...
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:00.040]   I'm just imagining myself explaining this to my father and imagining the look he would
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:05.680]   give me of barely masked contempt for the things that I find the best solution to a simple
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:06.680]   problem.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:08.320]   It is way overkill, okay?
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:11.320]   I mean, you have a Wi-Fi bridge for your light bulbs.
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:15.040]   But you can get any color you want.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.760]   I mean, the daylight is daylight.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:18.520]   You feel like the sun is shining.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.480]   The sunset is sunset.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:22.520]   There's a little bit of red, a little yellow.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.520]   It's beautiful.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.720]   It's actually album art.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:26.960]   Like iTunes 11 does.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:34.560]   I love this idea because there is like a studio cinema lighting.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:39.000]   The trend is especially in a James Cameron movie where one side of the room is blue,
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.800]   the underlying is red.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:46.440]   To be able to experiment with different lighting ideas for just on a basic whim like that is
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:47.880]   like, "Oh man."
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:52.880]   And yes, and yes, right now I am thinking about is this scriptable and a network addressable
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:57.000]   because I'm totally serious.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.760]   When you love to set up for the Star Wars movie where whatever's going on in the movie,
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.280]   you're getting sort of immersive lighting in the room to match it.
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:10.760]   And so now you can just like you can buy these like a riff tracks where you make sure you
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:13.520]   start the DVD and the MP3 at the same time.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.760]   You start the playback of the lighting at the same time.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:20.580]   You start the movie and people just build different lighting scripts to fit to for every
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:23.200]   single big movie that's out there.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.800]   That would be worth $300 to me.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:26.800]   And think of this.
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.760]   You could set an alarm where you use hue and your bedroom.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:34.000]   The lights are off and then it is at seven o'clock.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.480]   They slowly ramp up.
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:40.000]   First it's a sunrise and then it ramps up to a bright sunny day.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000]   I mean, imagine.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.520]   You can have sunrises in winter again, Leo.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.520]   Yes.
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:48.360]   I don't know if this would be a treatment for sads, but it's obviously got every color
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:51.600]   temperature so I would guess it could be.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:52.600]   And I think the price is right.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.200]   I mean, you get three bulbs.
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:58.720]   That's 180 bucks worth of bulbs plus the base station for 200 bucks and then it's 60
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.960]   bucks a bulb.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.280]   These LED lights are expensive.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:03.280]   They last a long time.
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.760]   I think it's worth it.
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:06.920]   Uses 2.4 gigahertz, by the way.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:07.920]   So it will.
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.520]   I don't know if it's actually Wi-Fi.
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:11.680]   It feels like it's Wi-Fi, but I don't know.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.680]   It's pretty wild.
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:13.680]   Mobile phone.
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:14.680]   It's fun Leo.
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:15.960]   We only live once.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:17.520]   I like it.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:22.240]   I am emailing Philips press contact right now.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:24.240]   Philips is doing some cool stuff.
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.240]   I am a real externalist.
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:28.480]   I cannot afford your hue, but I would like to try the hue.
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:29.480]   No, you should.
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:32.480]   I saw them in the Apple store when we went for the iPad Mini.
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:35.600]   I've just checked on the website, actually, for the UK.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.400]   We can't get them until March online.
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:38.400]   You know, that's weird.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:41.520]   I noticed that because when I tried to order it last month and it said not available till
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:43.040]   January and now they are.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:46.280]   So I'm thinking they're able to ramp up production or something's going on.
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.280]   I think they are in the shop store.
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.440]   And so get in the hue app.
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.280]   So it is a little bit like, and I can't wait until they're scriptable so you can do
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.280]   that.
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.600]   Siri, dim the lights, play cool jazz or whatever.
[01:51:58.600 --> 01:51:59.600]   That's what somebody in the chatroom suggests.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:02.600]   Shall I search the web for dim lights, Leo?
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.400]   Yeah, right.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:07.920]   Siri, put me in Hobbiton.
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:11.840]   And I love it that you could take a picture of something that was just a beautiful, you
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:15.240]   know, I don't know if you've noticed this, but light is different in different places.
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:17.480]   In Norway, there was a certain quality of light.
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:22.840]   You can take a picture of that and then make your hue light bulbs be that color.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:25.040]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.920]   Is there a color picker or something?
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:27.920]   Go on.
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:28.920]   Yes.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.280]   So you have the image and you have your light bulb.
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.680]   These light bulb is a point.
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:36.360]   You move the light so you can have different four different colors in each light bulb from
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:37.640]   different picture from the picture.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:39.160]   I can't show you because it's not set up yet.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:40.160]   I'll do it on before you buy.
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:43.320]   But so you can have a dot on different parts of the picture.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.320]   That light bulb is this.
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.320]   That light bulb is that.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.800]   So are you cool?
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.960]   Anyway, crazy.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:51.160]   First world problem.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:52.720]   There's people still using kerosene lamps.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:53.720]   I understand.
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:56.520]   I like it.
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:59.320]   It's 8hu.com.
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:00.800]   Okay.
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:03.080]   I think we're done for the day.
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:05.480]   Andy and I coach Chicago Sun times.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:09.400]   He is also, of course, a blogger and a great ukulele leleist.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.320]   When are you going to put out the CD?
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:17.920]   Well we're trying to get the surviving Beatles to gang up with the surviving members of the
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.480]   who as my backing band.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:22.000]   I'm told that it's just a couple of logistical problems.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.480]   We'll be getting right on that.
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:27.480]   I'm going to be doing a lot of the
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:30.040]   weekly solo and P-Towns and whaling away at an acoustic guitar.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.600]   I think that's going to be at least 10,000 downloads.
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:34.200]   At least 10,000.
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:35.200]   Thanks.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.200]   Merry Christmas.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:39.480]   Merry Christmas, Mr. Slabells ring.
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:41.120]   Are you listening?
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:44.800]   Merry Christmas, too, to imore.com's Renee Richie.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.800]   What are you doing for the holidays?
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:49.720]   I would guess Montreal is a great place to be for Christmas.
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:50.720]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:52.640]   I mean, it's going to be a winter wonderland.
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:55.800]   I will be trapped in my house with snow up to the top of the garage.
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:54:01.800]   So I will be forced to write blog articles and talk on the internet stuff like that.
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:02.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:03.960]   I am so sorry.
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:07.840]   You should go out and just find somebody who's roasting chestnuts.
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:08.840]   That's all I can say.
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:09.840]   How do the streets?
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:10.840]   They do that in Paris.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:11.840]   Do they do that in Montreal?
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.840]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:16.800]   And then we do the sugaring off, Leo, where we go and pour maple syrup on the snow for
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:17.800]   you.
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:19.440]   Love the sugaring off.
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:21.440]   E.
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:22.440]   Wow.
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.440]   Or do you eat?
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:24.440]   What do you do then?
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:27.440]   The maple syrup, you take the maple syrup, but they distill it so that it's very strong.
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:29.800]   And then they pour on the snow and it becomes almost like coffee.
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:30.800]   And then you eat it off.
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.800]   Come on to it.
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:32.800]   Cuddly, oh, come.
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:33.800]   We'll do it.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:34.800]   We'll plant your face in the snow.
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:35.800]   Well, you pull it off.
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:38.600]   You pull it off almost like a long toffee at that point.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:42.560]   Oh, when's that going to be?
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.120]   I feel so.
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:46.680]   I want to sugar off.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:48.320]   Do it.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:52.280]   Grandma Moses has a painting of sugaring off.
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:56.000]   You can get a poster of it.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.320]   Now I'm very curious about sugaring off.
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:01.800]   All right.
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:08.200]   And Mr. Screencast's online himself.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.200]   So good to see you again.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:11.720]   It was so much fun in Australia.
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:12.720]   Thank you.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:14.840]   Thank you for being here, Don McAllister.
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.840]   What are you doing for the holidays?
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:20.840]   I'm feverishly trying to get a couple of shows in the can so I can sort of just take
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.840]   some time off at the family year.
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:23.840]   Yeah, good.
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:24.840]   Nothing too dramatic.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.120]   I love to Barbara.
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.760]   The kids have a great holiday.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:30.160]   All of you too.
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:31.320]   We won't be here next week.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:36.400]   That's Christmas Day and we'll be with our loved ones celebrating Festivus on the 23rd.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:37.400]   Festivus.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.400]   Festivus.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:45.600]   If the world doesn't end day after tomorrow could happen.
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:47.200]   And we are going to take New Year's Day off as well.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.800]   So our next show will be January 8th.
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:52.120]   No, I won't even be here for that.
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:53.600]   I'll be in Vegas for CES.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:54.600]   You will?
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:55.600]   CES too.
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:56.600]   Yeah, so will Renee.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:57.600]   So what the hell are we going to do?
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:58.600]   I may have CNS.
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:55:59.600]   CSS.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:01.520]   We could do a show from there.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:03.000]   Okay, deal.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000]   I don't know what we're going to do.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000]   I think I'm busy.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.160]   Yeah, I assume we weren't busy, but we'll figure out some.
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:09.960]   In principle, we'll figure out something.
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:10.960]   Thank you all.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:11.960]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:12.960]   Remember Mac Break weeklies?
