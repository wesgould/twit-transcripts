[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.520]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. This is the show right here. This is the show where we
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.280]   talk about Mac-at-tosh and only Mac-at-tosh and iOS and Apple TV. Anything else that Apple's
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.200]   up to? The cloud. Let's say hello to our special in studio guest from Smile Software.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.000]   Jim McDonald is visiting us today. I guess you didn't want to leave after Macworld Expo.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.360]   No, I didn't. What is it? February and Oregon versus February and California.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.280]   Yeah, better here. It's very nice to be here.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.160]   Also with us, Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMore.com, who was also in town but you've gone back home.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.320]   I have. I got off the plan and I froze in spot. It was ridiculous.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   It was even chilly in the big easy down to the 70s.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.560]   I needed to bring that weather back with me. It's just not fair.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.760]   It's so nice. It was only one nipple cold as opposed to two.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.480]   I don't want to know about you nipples, Andy and Naco of the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.600]   Some of the waitresses were actually wearing two layers of body paint.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.040]   You know, funny you should say that.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.680]   I bet I'm not going to it. Let's talk about it. Tell us the story from New Orleans.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.440]   Yeah. Boy, I love New Orleans. I love New Orleans.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.120]   You know, there's a, that's a misnomer that you have to do anything naughty to get beads.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.080]   They're throwing them at you all the time. In fact, we get off the plane.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.600]   They put beads on you just like in Hawaii. They put a ley on you and you go into
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.760]   New Orleans. They put beads on you when you're getting off the plane.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.600]   They were so happy to have the Super Bowl there because of course it's really big for the economy
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.240]   for Super Bowl since post-Katrina and they had one in 2002.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.200]   But this is, so this was great for them and it was great for us. What a wonderful city.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.760]   We didn't have a meet up there. I didn't have time for a meet up. I was too busy drinking hurricanes.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.120]   It's hard work. But really, really had a great time.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.160]   It was, and now you know, it's funny as we're leaving. Now the Mardi Gras crowd goes in there
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.720]   because Mardi Gras next week and they actually held off on some of the parades during the Super Bowl
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.240]   week. We didn't get to see any parades, but the city was ready. It did very well,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.200]   except for the power outage. It did. It did a really wonderful, wonderful job.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.360]   So thank you, New Orleans. San Francisco hosted a little party of its own. This
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.600]   past week, Macworld Expo Jean and Renee were there along with thousands of others.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.160]   So Jean, you still go as a company. You still go to Macworld. Yes, we do.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.120]   I'm sorry, Macworld, I world. I was going to say Macworld, I world.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.720]   Because I bet you by next year it's just I world. Yeah, I haven't heard, but it's
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.600]   going to be where they're going. That's got to be where they're going.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.240]   They're going to be inching towards that. Drop that Mac thing.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.080]   Based on the network. By the way, you're going to be Jean Donald soon.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.560]   I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.840]   Yeah, based on the number of Mac versus iOS developers there, I would say that
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.680]   if it's not I world by next year, I would be surprised.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.960]   Honest impressions? Good show? It was, actually. It was.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.800]   So you weren't there. So that was the one downside of it. You were not there.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.960]   I was planning, but something came up.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:15.240]   It wasn't there, but it Renee was there. So it was Muscone West again.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.720]   They took those big stages that they normally have for the Macworld live show,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.080]   and they put them on the second level. So the Muscone West's
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.800]   main expo floor was all exhibitors. So it sounds like there were maybe more
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.920]   exhibitors than there were last year. I don't know what the official count is.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.160]   They were, it was a little more spaced out. We didn't feel that quite as crowded as
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.200]   come on. Of course, be honest, it's a dying show.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.360]   And there were less big booths. It's a dying show. Renee, will you say it? Is it a dying show?
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.160]   It's it's it's definitely a transforming show. There was no usually the omnibus
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160]   Maxie in the face as you walk in the door, and that was gone. No omnibus.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.720]   No, they did a private event instead. And there's a lot of the accessory makers had either
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.040]   smaller booths or no booth or just regular booths, not the big giant CES style building
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.080]   booths that you're used to. So in some ways it was a much quieter show. But I think we mentioned
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.120]   this last week, you know, you take Steve Jobs out and you take the giant booths out,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.040]   and it's still, you know, fantastic people. It's about community. But yeah,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.920]   that I always feels like when I hear that, that always feels like a cop out a little bit like,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.960]   oh, well, it's not about the people who are no longer coming here. You don't need Moscone, but
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.520]   you can do this small bar, it seems like. I can tell you, we were busy at our booth the whole time.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.600]   I took pictures every once in a while. My colleagues who were actually working at the booth were
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.080]   busy, they'll, you know, swamped answering questions and talking to the media.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.080]   So there were a lot of attendees. Yes, there were. It was definitely
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:50.280]   well attended and overall a pretty good feeling about it, which, you know, I'm always holding my
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.480]   breath a little bit because you never know. And by the way, I'm not, it's all the trade shows,
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.120]   I think, in my opinion, are, have been obsoleteed by the internet. And it's just a matter of time.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.960]   And we've seen many of them die. There used to be a big PC show, PC Expo every year, that's gone,
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.760]   Comdex is gone. CES seems to survive at Macworld shrinking. But all the big companies are gone
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.440]   from CES, they all do their own private events now. But you don't, in some ways, why go to a big
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.320]   event like that and be swamped with every other company that's there. And that's why I'm asking
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.360]   Eugene. I mean, so it's still important to smile though. It was good for us this year. It was our
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.560]   10th anniversary statement, if you don't go, right? Yeah. Well, it shouldn't be a statement. It's a
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.680]   business decision every year. We don't say we for sure go every year. We do have to make
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.560]   run the numbers and is it worth it? How it fits into our overall strategy. But this year, in particular,
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.360]   is our 10th anniversary. Actually, I brought you a little pass. Happy anniversary 10 years.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.760]   It's not present. That's our 10th anniversary screen. I have the last year's 9th anniversary
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.200]   screen. So I'm really glad to get the 10th, the 10th. You used to be smile on my Mac.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.240]   That's right. And everybody remembers to probably smile on my Mac. And of course, I should probably
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.560]   have said this at the beginning, you are also a sponsor of all shows with a smile software with both
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.960]   a PDF pen and text expand. We make an exception having you on the show. Don't other sponsors.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.000]   Don't get your excited hope. Jean is such an old friend and such a wonderful person that we make
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.760]   an exception having her on the show. Sorry, go ahead. I was going to say there was an interesting
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   transition this year. There were no booth babes as far as I could tell, but when Booth did bring a
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.400]   monkey, Booth monkeys far better, in my opinion. I don't know if this is escalation. Will there
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.440]   be a cheetah next year and then a rhino and then an elephant? Where does this end Leo? It's going
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:48.040]   to be hyper X, which had painted women at CES did not do it at Mac world. Good for them. No.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.280]   I wonder if that was a change or if they realized that the Mac world crowd was not going to be
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.600]   receptive to that kind of thing. I don't know if there was any of official word that came down,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.760]   but for example, Mac Keeper were the ones with the women in the extremely tight short black dresses
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.960]   with the booth number on their butts. And this time they just had guys and t-shirts like the rest of
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.200]   us. It's so inappropriate. It was that was that was refreshing actually. They skipped over men.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.360]   They went for they gave women a shot. They gave animals a shot. No one ever asked us if we wanted
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.000]   to be in tight clothing. Where's the booth guys? Yeah, we didn't even get a chance. It's just
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.720]   aggressive for a real group of booths. It's just good that if for one's you can blame the smell
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.640]   of it at a get a get conference on the monkey. It was one really weird booth, Leo. There was a
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.440]   guy who was and I'm not going to name the products. I don't want to give him any attention, but there
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.240]   was a guy who was a booth for two days with no product. And it was a really, really interesting
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.360]   product if it had been real. And it never arrived. And it was laid. It was being shipped from China.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.840]   And then finally it arrived on the last day and nobody could touch it. And by the end of the show,
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.120]   he was threatening people to stay like they were reported. You get away from my booth. Really? Yeah.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.320]   And what was it? It was supposedly a watch that could quote unquote,
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.680]   airplay anything from your iPhone to the face of the watch. And then it later turned out it might be
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.680]   an Android device from China. No one was really sure because you weren't allowed near it. Couldn't
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.480]   touch it. No. But I don't know why anyone would just stand there for two days with no product.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:25.880]   What do you gain? Infamy. Infamy. Well, yeah. I was wondering if it was he had investors and part
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.200]   of the key to getting the next level of funding was what we agree that we will show at this show.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.680]   And if you fail to make that deadline, then you don't get the next level of funding. Or he lost a
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:42.440]   bet. Or the more I mean, it's it's it seems it seems like the last act of like an episode of Seinfeld
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:48.520]   on a Kramer scheme in which six months earlier, he said, Jerry, we can buy these wristwatch
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.920]   wristwatch is Jerry $12 we put and we make a phone app for him, Jerry. And then six months later,
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.200]   okay, well, they got the watches, but they don't know how to do a phone app and they realize that
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.720]   airplane will not possibly work in that context. Yeah, it was it was weird. It was they missed a
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:09.560]   bet because they could have had MC Hammer as their spokesperson. You can't touch it. And they
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.960]   really could really could have gotten a lot of attention throughout a lot of attention. They
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:20.040]   did not the kind that they were wanting. But in Mac world, I like Lex Friedman, call them
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.720]   one trip nurse. One trip nurse. Yeah, Alex was actually one of the people that was told to get away
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:33.640]   from the rent. Get away. Wow, that's really there. There were tons of Twit fans there. I mean,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.800]   they they lots of people who really enjoyed the Twit network. And there were a lot of great panels
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.320]   because, you know, sometimes you forget that there's the Expo floor. There's also all the
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:46.280]   conferences and panels going on upstairs. And those were really well attended the Mac world live
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.680]   stage was almost always full. They had a lot of really interesting things going on.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:57.640]   eBooks in the future of Apple. And I did one with Gruber and Paul Kefesis and Matthew Panzino
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.600]   from the next web on whether Apple had abandoned power users. Oh, what was the conclusion of that?
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.480]   My conclusion is that Apple isn't abandoning power users. They would rather take mainstream
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.440]   people and empower them to do much more on their devices. So the cost is we don't get Mac pros,
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.840]   but my mom gets an iPad and now she's unable to use computing devices that she could never use
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:23.240]   when they were in their traditional keyboard and mouse driven form. So is that was abandoning
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:31.000]   its power users? Yes. Yes. Let's face it. Just say it. Come on. Yes. Yes.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.560]   Pro for you. Yes. Yes. So is your mom got into the discussion? I think the answer is yes.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Well, yeah. It turns out that we are not delivering electricity and cable TV to the
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.400]   suburban and rural areas, but we're very, very proud of the level of service that we're delivering
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.680]   to our urban areas, well populated areas. We're the user. Very, very well there. Yeah.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.440]   Yeah. It's just like cars. When you had to be a mechanic to drive a car and people didn't think
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.160]   you should drive a car if you weren't a mechanic and now we have cars with automatic steering and
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   cruise control and the CES will come find you in the driving. I understand all of that. But if you
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:13.880]   are a editor, a graphic designer, a newspaper layout person, if you're using the Mac for heavy
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:19.080]   duty work and you don't see a Mac Pro for two years and you don't, you seem.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:25.400]   Ex-service killed. Ex-service killed. There's really a question about how much effort is being
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:33.320]   put to OS 10 anymore. The Pro apps. The Pro apps. Look at that. Even I work is two years old. Yeah.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.600]   So you really, at that point, you have to make a decision.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:43.160]   And I think a lot of video editors, for instance, are faced with this decision. Do we stay with an
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.800]   out-of-date final cut? Do we update to a final cut that won't do everything we want? Or do we move
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:54.600]   to Windows? Or option three, you look at how Apple has operated in the past where they're not
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.120]   really a big, they don't do revolution by doing transitional things like a Windows 8 where they
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:07.560]   still have one foot in desktop, one foot in multi-touch mobile. I wonder if sometime in the next 18
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.880]   months, we're going to see something totally revolutionary from Apple where they're saying,
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.920]   yeah, I know that we haven't really up in retrospect. It'll occur to us that, yeah, I guess the reason
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.480]   why they didn't put all that effort into putting together totally revamped apps of Final Cut,
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.360]   totally revamped versions of Aperture, totally revamped versions of iWork was because they were
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.880]   going to do a completely new interface, a completely new relationship between the way that apps interact
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.680]   with each other. And that's what they were putting all their effort into, not making their current
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:43.400]   products look newer, but to get us ready for the time when they do the most surprising keynote
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.920]   after post-quarterly actuals and store openings ever since the release of the iPhone.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.680]   Yeah. Today, Apple reinvents the Pro.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.960]   I don't know. I think you guys are a little bit living in the past, but I don't want to be too
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:03.160]   much of a negative man. I wouldn't say living in the past is just that if Apple were truly in
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.880]   the position where they're saying that the numbers that we're selling in such great numbers,
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:14.760]   there's a proven love of our products as they are right now. We feel no need to reinvent the iPad,
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.800]   we feel no need to reinvent these other products that we can't manufacture fast enough. We believe
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:25.160]   that we're best serving our customers by just simply transitioning improving what we're doing right
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:31.560]   now. If that's really what the mode that they're growing into, I think that would be unprecedented
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:38.280]   since the Schindler era. I'm not sure this evidence that Apple would ever give up to that extent.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.080]   I think it's just such a new era that we don't. The cookie era is not any other era. It's not like
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.720]   any other era. It's not like the jobs here. We don't really know.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.480]   It's terrible. But we're talking about it. Schindler was the time when any store that
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.000]   wanted a separate SKU for tracking purposes, they would get a separate SKU.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:02.680]   Apple still could say no in that regard. It's true. I do think that there's something revolutionary
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.400]   coming. I suspect there's something revolutionary coming that would be very consistent with how
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.880]   they operate. However, I also do think that the clock is definitely ticking. I think that now
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:17.720]   there is an 18-month shot clock in which Apple has to say, here is where we're going in the next
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.960]   five years. Here's the great stuff that we're going to be releasing a year from now, two years
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   from now. Because if a year from now, we're saying, "It's the new second, third-generation iPad Mini.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:34.440]   It's four grams lighter." Now it's available in four colors. You're welcome. We're like, "Hey."
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.760]   Because here's an Android tablet that actually doubles as a hoverboard. Every time I wake it up,
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.000]   it tells me how nice my shoes are. It turns upside down twice a day, but it hovers.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.320]   What if Apple is planning to buy back its stock, take its self-private? They certainly could
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:57.000]   start to do that. Their market cap's pretty high. They have been buying back stock. As the price
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.160]   goes down, they buy back more. Then they get out of the rat race of having to meet quarterly
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.200]   expectations of how to report to the stock market and shareholders. Then they can be innovative.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.560]   Maybe the pressure is now. They're so successful in iOS. Look what happened to the stock price when
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.520]   their margins went down this much. I think Andy nailed it before when he talked about the iterative
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.760]   way that they do things. If you look from a year to year, there's never a huge change. If you go back
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:30.760]   to the original iPhone in 2007 and look at the iPhone 5, it's phenomenal how far they've come.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.040]   Maybe pro apps haven't been developed as much. Even the iMac now is a very good pro machine.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.760]   It doesn't have the card slots that someone like Alex would like. I do like the iMac a lot.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.320]   I think the new iMac, which I just got, is pretty impressive, very fast, but it's not a pro machine.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:51.640]   Has no slots. Well, that's an area in which I do think Apple sometimes takes their eye off the ball.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.360]   I've said it before, so I'm not getting into detail. There's just no functional advantage
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.840]   to a desktop that's that much thinner. When you move the card slots to some place where you just
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.240]   plain can't reach it. When you remove a component that you don't use every day, but a couple times
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.640]   you use it a year, it's very, very handy and it costs next to nothing to put it in there.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.520]   It's like, well, thank you. So now when I look dead on at my screen, 12 hours a day,
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.520]   I will know that somewhere in the back of that people entering my office will know what a nice
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:26.360]   thin display I am. Otherwise, I kind of wish I didn't otherwise, I kind of wish I didn't have
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.760]   to have this external card reader on my desktop so I can actually swap in cards about having
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.200]   to unplug my stack of hard drives to get at it.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.840]   I like that they're plucking. They're willing to try things. I mean, the buttonless shuffle was a
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.840]   disaster in many ways, but they tried it and then they went back to the old version. And I'm hoping
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.720]   the iMac is like that where they're experimenting with laminated displays and ultra thin housings.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.400]   And you may be the card in the back is not a good idea and it'll go back with the next generation.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.560]   But I'd rather that than them just keep the same model and never try unusual things.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.520]   In the end, the signature thing we would always miss about Apple is if they stopped being a
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.560]   company that makes exactly the device it makes it wants to make.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:09.000]   Because Samsung does that. Samsung will make any device I think.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.680]   So they do something and they do some lovely devices that way. But the signature of Apple is
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.400]   that no, you had no idea that we could design a device this way. We started playing with materials,
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.320]   we started playing with some ideas. We love this product and that's why we're making it.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.480]   We're certainly we're going to be selling a boatload of them, but we're making this product
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.000]   because we thought that a really, really super thin iMac would be a cool thing to make.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.080]   And that's why we made it. We're going to take a break. When we come back,
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.120]   I want to talk about the best of Macworld. Because I think you've got to see that in front of you,
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.280]   Jean, but the best products were of Macworld. But I'm going to put on my Beyonce brand finger
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:49.640]   lasers right now. My eyes, my eyes. By the way, so this is a recipe for disaster. Because they put
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:56.200]   these blue LED, they're not lasers, these blue LEDs on every seat in the Super Bowl. And then
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:03.880]   they say, whatever you do, do not open the package, do not turn them on until Beyonce sings party people.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:09.080]   Do not. And of course, what's the very first thing that happens? The whole place lights up
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.640]   with people not opening their lasers and not putting them on and not turning them on.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.120]   What a recipe is asked. You don't give 71,000 monkeys finger lasers and then say,
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:24.760]   don't use them whatever you do. Crazy. Whoever thought that went up. Leo just called NFL fans
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:31.400]   monkey. I'm one of them. Big, curly, angry one. We're just we're just looks like an Ironman villain
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:37.880]   on a slightly evolved monkeys. There's something about NFL that brings out the best of us. We're
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:44.280]   that's them. That's what it is. Sponsors. That's the that's the Beyonce finger lasers brought to you
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.360]   by the Beyonce finger lasers. So I went down the road and I took them from every cup just in case.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:56.040]   Because I want to make sure I had plenty to bring home. Actually, that the Beyonce halftime show
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.160]   was pretty amazing. If you like it, you should have been a finger put a finger laser on it.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:05.000]   Exactly. Put a finger. I think that's what we were supposed to do it too was when she said put a
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.840]   ring on it. We're supposed to go like this. They had directions. You're supposed to go like this
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:15.080]   and then like this. If you didn't follow the directions, you get locked out of the crowd.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.760]   You don't want to be on say if you will not do the direction. I want to know. I was I was trying
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.880]   to see if Jesse Jackson was using his, but I didn't see. I couldn't tell. Mr. McCartney,
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.920]   Sir Paul McCartney was I'm glad to report. He's he's into it. He's down. He's down with the finger
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.640]   lasers. I showed today brought to you by their friends at Citrix who make that great go to meeting
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:39.400]   the way you can work face to face with anyone anywhere, especially during the winter time.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.680]   Throats are scratchy. People stay home. Flights are canceled. Roads are closed. Go to meeting. Let's
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.000]   you continue to get work done no matter where you are. It's the fast and easy way to meet with
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.320]   clients and coworkers online. We use it. I think literally every day here, one of our staff is having
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:01.080]   a go to meeting with somebody else, often clients, often colleagues. It's great for training, collaboration.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.880]   It's very easy to set up a meeting. We use it. One of the reasons we really like to use it is because
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   if you use the Outlook, plug it. It's very easy to set up a meeting that way, but you can just click a link,
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:16.040]   send it to everybody in the meeting, add it to their calendar via email, and then they just click
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.760]   a link to join the meeting. They can use the built-in VoIP bridge or they can even give them a phone
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.320]   number they can call in. They press the button on the camera and boom, you're seeing them. They're
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.280]   seeing you. You can even present from an iPad, which is absolutely amazing. You attend a meeting
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.240]   from an iPad, an iPhone, Android device, but to be able to present from an iPad and for them to
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.000]   see you with the iPad camera, that is amazing. That is truly amazing.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.400]   So when you can't make it into the office, you can still be productive, still get things done.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.720]   I want you to try this free. Just click the "try it free" button at the go to meeting website,
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.160]   go to meeting.com. Promo code for this is Mac break. You'll have to click that link that says
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:59.240]   promo code and enter Mac break, one word. And you get it for three for 30 days. The software on the
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.560]   iPhone and iPad and everything is free too. All the clients are free. It really is worth it.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.200]   Next time you're going to have a meeting, say, "Hey, wait a minute. I got an idea. Let's do a
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.240]   go to meeting." And you could literally within three minutes have it installed and ready to go.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.560]   Go to meeting.com. The promo code is Mac break. It's great for your clients too, because most of
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.760]   the time they don't have anything installed, but they click the link. The whole thing has handled
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.360]   for them. It's automatically installed and runs in there in. It's kind of like magic.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:31.960]   So best of Mac world expo 20, I'm sorry, Mac world iWorld 2013. Gene, did you get you've won many
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.320]   times in the past? No award this year? We got the Mac observers, editors choice award.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   Good. For PDF panel, text experiment. The problem with Texas panders has been around so long,
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.080]   everybody knows it's not, people feel like, "Well, I don't need to give this an award." It's like,
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.520]   this is like an obvious no problem. Well, when we introduce the mind reading text expander,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.680]   that you don't have to-- Then you can win another-- I think we'll win a--
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.520]   Brains to spander. Yeah. Brain expanding. Brain expanding. So what were some of the
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.880]   winners? Well, they can't go without mentioning Boink's one again. Oh, Oliver, I didn't see you.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.760]   Oliver Bridenbeck is here from Boink Software. Yes. You two are joined at the hip somehow.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:12.520]   Wherever gene goes, there goes Oliver. So you won for which I stop motion? Yes, they did win
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:19.720]   for a stop motion. What's this? A gumbi pen. That's a-- So you can make a stop motion video. They were
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.360]   doing that at their booth. I think they won because they had the best swag. And I stop motion for the
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:30.840]   iPad is fantastic, recently updated. And just real-- So you could use this. All right, I'm going to
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:38.360]   do that. Yeah. So of course, that puts Oliver for those who are keeping score at home ahead of
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:44.600]   smile in the best of show category. How many of you won Oliver? You know? Second in the row.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.320]   We've never won twice in the row. It's a two-peat. It's a two-peat. Yes. Last year we were ahead.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:55.480]   This year. That's cool. That's the way it goes. But there were a number of other interesting products.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:02.360]   But only two software products. I stopped motion. And then this thing called Crazy Face. I don't
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:09.000]   know if you saw that, Renee. I did not. That was-- I highly recommend checking out that demo on
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:19.640]   macworld.com. It's a way of animating 2D photo so that it can be 3D rotating and talking and
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:25.080]   doing stuff with its eyes. It's impossible. When people told me that had won, I thought, what?
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:30.360]   It sounded like some silly iPhone app. But actually, if you go look at the demo, it's quite
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.440]   sophisticated. And I can see where-- It's funny. When I type Crazy Face into Google, it tries to
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:41.480]   complete it with Crazy Face Book status. Here is Crazy Face. Is that it? No, that's not it.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:48.200]   No, it's Crazy Talk. I'm sorry. Big difference. Yes, it is a big difference. I got the Crazy Face.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:55.720]   They probably won at that. Crazy Talk. It's already taken. So, you can actually record audio.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.880]   It has this generator. It's from real. Well, it's real illusion.com.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:14.520]   R-E-A-L-L-U-S-I-O-N.com. Anyway, I have a copy of this. I never used it. I thought, what would I do with
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:22.920]   this? I mean, it's from the demo I saw, it's easy enough to set up all the points of animation on
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.720]   the mouth and eyes and everything of a picture. And then you just record some audio.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:36.040]   Automatically makes it talk. It was quite cool. But like I said, out of, I don't know, there's 10 or 12
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:41.560]   awards here, only two of them are software, which is a pretty lopsided here from the point
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:49.480]   of view of the software developers. There were some cool hardware-- Here's the demo reel for
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.480]   Crazy Talk. There's ads on everything on YouTube now.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:27:00.200]   I think a lot of the big software-- I mean, one password had a version. One password for is
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.720]   awesome. But a lot of fantastic hours just walking around. They didn't have a booth this year.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.600]   They love Fantastic Count. One of my favorite programs of all time.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:14.360]   I thought, actually, I'm no judge, but I think the new one password is so amazing.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.440]   And I'm surprised they were all for the looks. No, they weren't for them either. They were there.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:24.280]   They had a booth this year. Yeah. Oh, so this is how they do the baby on the E-Trade. Exactly.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:32.840]   It's scary looking. I want it now. I was too tired this morning to do one. I could finally animate
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:41.000]   John C. de Vorek. That's good. Wow, look at that. So that's creepy.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.000]   But you could see where-- I mean, maybe the practical applications are not
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.320]   very high, but the educational-- Well, and the technology is kind of interesting.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.240]   The technology is very interesting. Yeah. People were talking, in fact, I got a lot of people on
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:02.040]   Facebook telling me about this Padcaster, which is like a podcasting kit. Oh, really?
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:08.200]   For the iPad? Or-- I guess. There's a lot of that stuff now. I mean, they're making adopters.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.400]   You can put XLR mics right into an iPad. And Blue had a microphone called Nessie
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.720]   that you can run through an iPad. It does-- has a built-in pop filter built-in--
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:23.880]   Sorry, the thing that-- Yeah, built-in shock mount. It does audio processing on the things.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.440]   Wow. So if you're not an audio expert, you can still get great-looking sound. You can get pure
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.520]   audio out if you are an expert, but they're doing a lot of things to make on the road iPad
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.520]   podcasting and audio of all kinds. Really simple. And the other thing that I thought was really
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   great, and I saw it also at CES, was the new Fujitsu Scan Snap, Ix500 that
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:53.560]   can-- you can now scan directly to your iPad or your iPhone. Among other things, it's faster.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:29:00.040]   It's-- and it's just really nice-looking, and I'm going to get one. So does it via Bluetooth?
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.120]   Wi-Fi? How does it-- That's a very good question. I said no that, but I don't.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.280]   It's okay. I know. They also had Ollo clip there, and they have an adapter for the iPod touch now,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.440]   so you can use their lens with the iPod touch, and they have a case so you can mount it to a tripod or
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.960]   watch. I need that because I have to take my Ollo clip-- my case off to use my Ollo clip. I love
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.320]   the Ollo clip. It allows you to do telephoto, wide angle. I wanted to bring it to the Super Bowl I
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.560]   forgot to, but-- And they have a zoom lens coming too. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, they were there. They
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:33.800]   had one of the bigger booths, and it wasn't that big. I have to say that I normally I would bring
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.720]   a bunch of camera gear on a trip like this, and I didn't. I had the iPhone, and I used that as
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.920]   basically my point and shoot the whole time. And the one thing that you miss is the ability to get
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:49.320]   good zoom telephoto pictures. Now this is not quite it. It's optically not perfect, but it gives you
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:54.680]   something. Yeah. Yeah, there's two things you missed out on. One's a telephoto, and the other is a
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:04.920]   good flash. I mean, I was editing a photo that I shot in 1999 with only my second real digital camera.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:11.880]   And it would look like garbage. I had mentioned it to God, the original. But the fact that it had a
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:17.320]   good flash that I managed to make it pop to fill in the shadows made it look-- and this is the best
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:23.720]   company you give to a 1999 digital camera. It looked just as good as an iPhone 5 camera shot.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:31.000]   But that would have been possible without a good flash. So we're at 1999, baby.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:39.160]   So the scan here's the scan snap. Thank you to Poopater or Puppet or Pupeter in the chat. It's
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.520]   expensive. It's the same price though as the current one. 450 bucks. Is this one? Is it?
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.960]   Yeah. No, I think it is. I think it's 500 is the
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.040]   realistic price. This is a different kind of scan. Yeah, that's it. The Ix 500.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:59.480]   For just to mix a bunch of scanners in the snap scan line, one of them is this really cool travel
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:07.400]   bar sized one that costs them like $130. That's more practical. This thing is a desk scanner,
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:14.600]   but it does go right to iOS. Everybody I know who's gotten a Fujitsu of this caliber has digitized
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.880]   everything they own. They start looking around their house for other things. Can I stop moving
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:24.840]   slowly enough? Yes. And the advantage of this is it's a sheet feed. So if you have big long documents
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:30.760]   or whatever and business cards-- Oh, it does. That explains it. In other words, it takes the
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:36.120]   pain out of being paperless. Anyway, that's my year. It takes the pain out of being paperless.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.280]   I should sell that to them. I'm sure you're working for the wrong guy. You need to go to Fujitsu.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:47.160]   Business card scanning software included. It also will scan right to Evernote or Dropbox or
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.400]   Sugar Sanker. It was an interesting theme for enterprise stuff this year. Two, a number of companies
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:56.760]   are starting to try to test enterprise. Ecamm Huda Booth right next to Smile is doing Printopia
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:02.680]   Pro so that you can easily deploy your iPads and iPhones and print in offices where the old printers
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.480]   don't support it. And Riddle, who does documents and a lot of business apps, they're going right
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:13.320]   around Apple's rather poor enterprise support and making their apps work on a subscription basis.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.160]   So you just get the free app and you subscribe. You can do all sorts of enterprise deployments.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.560]   I like this activity app. When you buy, if you buy the scan snap, then Amazon suggests that you
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:29.080]   buy this red rubber stamp that says, "Scanned." So that you can file away the paper.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:34.920]   He's going to pay for a scan. I think if that algorithm were smart, it would also sell you
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:41.160]   a shredder next to that. Scanned and into the shredder. Boom. That's pretty funny. Yeah,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.960]   they have a variety of scan snaps. And as you said, Andy, they have a little one for the year.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:52.840]   But that's interesting that that should win a scanner. It was pretty impressive. And they were
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:59.640]   always busy and another one of the big booths. But yeah, it was. And there was also the Mac IT
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.040]   conference going on upstairs. I didn't get to check that out at all, but there were a lot of
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:09.000]   heavy duty IT type people there that I know. I think I really do think that the conference
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.240]   track is really the thing that keeps these things alive. That's something you can't do really as
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.560]   well online. You've got Linda Dotcom in lots of places like that. But this is somewhere to go see.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.920]   And it becomes about, in some ways, celebrities to see Renee Ritchie and John Zuber on a panel
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.440]   and hear what they think about the future of Pro Apps that has some value that you just aren't
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.600]   going to get. Whereas to see the latest scan snap, I just learned everything I want to do about it
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:36.280]   by going to the Amazon page in about five seconds, right? Right. We had an iBook channel with
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:41.880]   Serenity Caldwell from Macworld. Scott Simpson used to run iBooks. I love Scott. David Sparks was
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:48.120]   on that. Yeah. The tidbits team were on it. I mean, to get their knowledge on eBooks all on one
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:53.560]   panel, you can't get that anywhere else. That's true. And they've made this change as of last year.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   They have what they call the iFAN pass that this was 75 to $100. And that meant it was affordable for
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:07.640]   much more affordable than it used to be. It used to be like about $300 for a similar lineup of
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:13.480]   would then be most absolutely. I think that's the future. And then the iFAN, I know that those
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:20.840]   rooms were false. And doing them regionally as our local North Coast Mac user does here,
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:27.560]   I imagine a day, someday, I dream of a time where there'll be regional iWorld, Macworlds,
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.840]   all over the country. So you don't have to fly to San Francisco. You can go to St. Louis or go to
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.720]   Boston and have these same kinds of events. That's how it then they become, they're basically now
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.720]   kind of super user groups. Yeah. Well, not only that, but it's useful just from the,
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:51.320]   just in the sense that here is one four or five day period in which the entire Apple/Mac community
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:57.320]   has agreed that we're going to be in this city for the 96 hour period. Last year, for instance,
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.720]   I was talking to a lot of people who run PR agencies and they're saying this was the last
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:07.800]   year show at least was an incredible bargain for their clients because it's not if years and
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:12.760]   years gone by when Adobe was there, when Apple was there, when Steve had his keynote,
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.200]   everybody, every journalist who was sent there to cover the show would write about Apple and
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.360]   they'd write about Adobe and they'd write about Microsoft. Now, essentially, everybody can get
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.520]   it, but you can get about 15 minutes worth of time from everybody who writes about anything,
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.720]   an Apple iPhone, iOS or Mac. And so it's a very target rich environment. I'm not surprised you
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:35.080]   don't see more people like a like a fantastic Al just saying, well, it's not worth our time to
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:39.880]   get a booth. It's definitely worth our time to get a hotel room nearby and just make the calls
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.640]   around to find out who's going to be in town and then give them a good 20 minute or half hour demo
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.760]   of what we're coming up next. Does WWDC, I guess it doesn't supersede because it's really only for
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:56.120]   developers. The real people don't go to that. It's only, well, it's, it has some of that going on.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:03.320]   I mean, when I go to WWDC, I am a developer, I am not, but it's not politically very, very smart
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   for me to try to go beyond the public keynote day. But even so, like if I'm there, I'm definitely
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.800]   staying there for like two or three days after the keynote because just like with Mac world iWorld,
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.200]   everybody who does anything in the Mac or Mac space and iPhone space is going to be there in
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:23.880]   that one space. And so breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, runs to get comic books, all of those
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.640]   things are opportunities to like hang out with people who are at the very minimum going to be
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.120]   very, very interesting to talk to. At best, is going to show me something that they couldn't show
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.840]   me except for hi. I provisioned this on my personal device and you're to forget that you saw this
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:43.960]   as soon as you see me run this thing. We're talking with Andy Inacov at Chicago Sun Times from
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:51.640]   smile software.com, Jim McDonald and from iMore.com. Renee Ritchie, our kind of our Mac world iWorld
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:56.120]   summary and some other Mac news coming up in just a little bit, some actually bad news.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:01.080]   Mac news coming up just a little bit. But first a word from our friends at Gazelle. Here's the good
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.480]   news. You don't have to be stuck with those old gadgets. If you've got a oh heaven for
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:11.720]   fend, an iPad three, the third generation and you want the iPad four, the fourth generation,
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:18.040]   here's the way to make it easy. G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com. They'll buy your old iPad. But let's just see.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:23.320]   Third generation iPad, which is at 18 tier Verizon. Verizon? Okay.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.080]   >> So that kind of thing. >> You ready to get rid of it, Jean?
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.320]   >> All right. >> But size is LTE.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.280]   >> LTE. >> Have 32. >> 64.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:36.200]   All right. Let's get an offer for your Eugene and her old iPad. It's in good shape. 290 bucks.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.280]   It's going to get you halfway towards your new fourth generation.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.480]   >> I actually put my iPhone 4 to them.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.880]   >> Yeah. It's a good deal. Did it work? How it worked?
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:49.720]   >> It worked very well. Yeah. And you can decide to get paid in like Amazon card. You get a little
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.880]   bit more. >> 5% more with the Amazon card.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.680]   That's the pro tip. >> It's been the money at Amazon.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.360]   >> Yeah. They'll do PayPal. They'll do check, of course. But the Amazon gift card,
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.560]   I think, is a good way to do it. So the deal is they pay the postage. So really, what you should
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:06.360]   do is go through your old gadgets or get everything, you know, and get quotes. Those quotes are good
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:11.080]   for 30 days. You have 30 days to take advantage of that. So if, for instance, you said, "Hmm,
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.120]   I just can't decide." You could at least find out what it's worth. And by the way,
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.320]   the sooner you do it, the more the value because the price is not going up.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.600]   >> I should have done that. >> Yeah.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.800]   Price is going down, Jean, on every, on all this stuff.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:27.640]   So it really is worth getting a quote now and deciding later is what I really want to do this.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.640]   They, once you do push the button, say, "Okay, I got everything I want to sell,"
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.480]   they'll send you an appropriately sized box postage paid, right? >> Yes.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.080]   >> Throw in the box. >> It was as easy as could be.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.880]   >> Mail it and they get you a check. How was it pretty quick? >> Yeah. With the new week.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.440]   >> They also wipe your data, which is nice. I know a lot of people--
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.920]   >> I wipe my own, but I knew that they'd do that.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.120]   >> A lot of people, I think, in our audience go on, I'm not going to trust. But really truthfully,
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.800]   they're data-- it's part of the-- they're checking to make sure that the product is in
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.520]   the condition you said it was. They want to make sure it's functioning and all that.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.760]   But in the process, it's automatic. They wipe the data. And yeah, you can trust them. In fact,
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:06.280]   I'll tell you what, let me see. I think it's they've had 500,000 customers paid out over $50
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:11.160]   million over the last few years. There's a lot of people. You really can trust these guys. I am a
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.520]   big fan of Cassell. We've used it. Gene, now, I didn't know that, has used it. >> I used your code,
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.960]   I think, too. >> Well, there is no code. So that's the beauty of it.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.200]   >> All right. I think I told them. I've heard about it from Matt Break Weekly.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.960]   Say Matt Break Weekly. Say Gene McDonald told me. Smile software.com.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:36.760]   Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com is definitely the way to get money for your gadgets.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.600]   So this is the bad news, at least if you're in Europe. But I think it tells you something a
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.800]   little bit about Apple's intentions as well. You probably knew this by the time you were doing
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:52.760]   the panel, Renee. Apple is discontinuing the Mac Pro in Europe as of March 1st because it does
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.320]   not live up to regulatory standards. Normally, if you really felt like that was a product you
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:03.000]   wanted to sell and it was selling, you probably updated to fit the regulatory standards. But they're
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.240]   saying, "No, we're just going to-- nobody wants this." >> Well, it's one of two things. It's either that
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:14.360]   it's not financially enjoyable for them to update the current model to those specs. And that's
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.000]   either because they're going to discontinue it at some point, or because they are working on
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.080]   that next generation thing that Tim Cook mentioned in passing maybe last year that Apple is working on.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:32.280]   But if they have a pro-machine in development towards the end of 2013, they may not feel like
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.040]   spending any engineering resources or take any engineering resources away from that.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.920]   To update something for the EU right now, given the volume they sell. >> And it would be telling
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.800]   if we knew what was not compliant, but Apple's not saying it. It's not obvious what is not compliant.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.560]   >> No micro USB. >> Yeah, right.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.840]   >> It's actually the fans. The fans need a great-- so that when you reach your hand into an open
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.200]   PC that you don't smack your fingers on that thing. >> Oh, come on.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:06.040]   Talk about the nanny state. No seat belts on the Mac Pro. Now, well, I know reason I wanted to
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:10.280]   know that. Thank you, Chad. I didn't know that. The reason I wanted to know that is that tells you
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:14.680]   how difficult it would have been for Apple to fix it. And in this case, not at all.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:20.120]   Like five cents worth. I mean, you could staple some screen on it.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:26.280]   >> You can't deny it. Just not staple. >> You could actually, in an inexpensive retrofit
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:30.840]   existing Mac. If that's all it is, where did you hear that? Because this is not in this 9-5 Mac
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.720]   or-- >> It was-- we covered this on Twitch. And that was the issue that was brought up.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.680]   >> It says, "The new product certification standards in Europe appear to be mainly connected to
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.840]   internal components such as power supply parts and wiring according to 9-5 Mac. And this was
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:48.680]   written in January 31st Mark Gurman about five days ago. It's unclear which aspects of the new
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.720]   standards are not met by the current Mac. So maybe some later stuff came out.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:59.160]   >> That's-- if it's really that, then what do you say, Renee Ritchie?
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.400]   >> Now, again, I just don't think that given the volumes they sell, they want to take any
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.360]   effort whatsoever to update a product that is that old and they'd rather-- I mean, they have a
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.200]   habit of that. They are relentless in pursuit of the future and they will ditch anything past.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.200]   To the detriment of a lot of existing user bases, but that's just the way they are.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.920]   >> Well, I'm really pleased that children in Europe will no longer lose fingers to Mac Pro fans.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.440]   That's been a great scourge. And-- >> No.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.240]   >> Also, they have no way to make "Noisemakers" are they're tiny, tiny little baseball cards.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.920]   [laughter]
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.080]   >> But yeah, I mean, think about what Apple's doing with the Mac Pro as it is.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:40.200]   There is a flourishing market in hack-and-toshes. People who are sick and tired of waiting for
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.480]   Apple to update it, and they're building their own out of Intel components.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.280]   And Apple is letting that simply happen. That's how aggressive they are in not
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:54.600]   caring about updating the Mac Pro in 2012. So I agree with Renee. I don't know if this means
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.920]   necessarily abandoning the Mac Pro. I think it means that there is no point in even taking
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:04.520]   minimal effort to make this device comply, given that this is not a device that sells in
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:10.840]   millions per-- tens of millions per quarter. And we've got something new coming out soon anyway.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.920]   Why ruin our vacations? >> Yeah, I wouldn't want them to do that.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:20.440]   This is from Mac World UK, the new requirements necessitate fan guards and some increased protection
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.680]   on the ports on the electrical system, neither of which sound like very complicated or expensive
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:30.440]   updates. But hey, what the heck? >> Also, the CPU requires-- needs to have a two-hour lunch break
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:36.680]   for every 12 hours of up to 10. >> It's working too hard. >> And a second Mac Pro that was supervised,
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.320]   the other one. >> Apple is a trademarking the design of its retail stores, probably in response
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:45.320]   to the fact that the Microsoft store is-- >> Look exactly the same! >> And the Samsung store.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:50.280]   >> And the Samsung stores. >> The Microsoft store at the-- at the-- at the-- at the-- at
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.400]   the-- at the-- at the-- at the-- at the-- at the potential place is actually horizontal instead of--
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.680]   [laughter] >> Instead of-- instead of being-- >> And what if they don't have a genius--
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.680]   >> No, no, no, no. >> --not how you feel it's that other-- >> --it feels stupid now.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.400]   >> Instead of the genius bar, what do they-- they have something like the know-it-all bar?
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.880]   What is it that they have? >> Or something. >> Something like that.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.720]   >> They have the compliance bar. >> Yeah.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.480]   >> But they have the tables on the left and the shelves on the right, not the other way or--
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.360]   [laughter]
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.560]   >> The description of the trademark includes a clear glass storefront. Well, come on.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:21.720]   Surrounded by a paneled facade. And within the store, an oblong table with stools set below
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.560]   video screens, flush mounted on the back wall. >> Good luck with that.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.160]   [laughter]
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.520]   >> Now, you do remember that in China, there was an Apple store that wasn't an Apple store that
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:38.200]   looked exactly the same, but that was also selling iPhones that looked exactly the same and non-ipads.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.960]   >> Even boys did not know that it wasn't an Apple store.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.400]   >> They didn't even know-- no. >> Yes.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.000]   >> Yeah. >> They thought they worked for Apple.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.440]   I keep wishing I could get more information about these i-stores that you sometimes see,
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.640]   like when we were in Bermuda on a key cruise. >> Bermuda, yeah.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:57.720]   >> They had a-- there was a store that you walked in and it looked exactly like an Apple store.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.760]   And I'm talking about the exact same furniture, exact same fixtures, exact same products,
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.680]   not only the exact same Apple products, but the exact same non-Apple products,
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.520]   configured in something the exact same way with a Genius Bar in the back,
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:17.480]   called the Genius Bar. And it was so close to an Apple store that I was trying to figure--
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.320]   that there was a lot of theories going around because I'd never seen something like this before.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:26.920]   And one theory going around is that, of course, in Bermuda, you couldn't have a corporate own store
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:32.600]   in that country. And this was a way for Apple to have a presence there without having an official
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:38.280]   presence there. And that's why they kind of ripped off everything. But that was just something
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.640]   that unfortunately it's one of those things that's really, really tough to get an answer to.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.760]   The only time you will ever get a clear answer is when somebody-- people with every reason whatsoever
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:52.280]   not to talk to somebody who decides not to write for something who writes for living, including the
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:46:00.040]   owners of the store, including Apple, including everybody. They had the same products on display,
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:05.000]   but they didn't actually have actual products to sell because the iPad-- I forget what said--
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.640]   the iPad just came out then or one of the iPads. And everybody was coming into that store in
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.280]   Bermuda to look at the iPad, but they didn't actually have any to sell. So it's not illegal.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:21.640]   I do refer you to the famous 1992 Supreme Court decision, two pesos versus Taco Cabana.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:33.640]   I had a number. In which the Supreme Court said, in fact, that two pesos was able to protect
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:40.280]   how their restaurants looked so that that cheesy Taco Cabana rip off would not fool consumers.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:48.600]   I like Taco Cabana. You've been to a Taco Cabana? Yeah, it's a Texas thing. It's a Tex-Mex fast food
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.840]   restaurant. This is the precedent, though, that trade dress may be protected under the trademark
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:58.040]   act. We don't want a stifle innovation of chimichangos. We just think that they should
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:02.120]   invent their own chimichangos. Actually, Taco Cabana-- Look for the world.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:09.080]   Taco Cabana was the original. Two pesos was copying Taco Cabana. Let's get that straight.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:15.720]   Taco Cabana is in the right here. Yes. Taco Cabana, the first was opened in San Antonio in 1978.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:23.560]   And it is-- here's its trade dress, a festive eating atmosphere involving interior dining and
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:29.560]   patio areas decorated with artifacts, bright colors, paintings, and murals. This sounds exactly like
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:36.680]   the Twit commissary. There's a lot of trouble, Leo. The stepped exterior of the building is a
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.920]   festive and vivid color scheme. See, you see, it's so vague, but the Supreme Court upheld it.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:45.320]   And I think what they look at is they say, well, this is what Taco Cabana looks like.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.720]   This is what two pesos looks like. Obviously, they're stealing it. And I think that's--
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.120]   And you have everything. We just file one of these. You ask for the moon and then you let them
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:57.320]   whittle away at it. Right. Believe me, I know all about that. Some day, we'll be able to talk about
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.600]   that. Two million dollar question-- or the million dollar question in this instance
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.080]   is just how close a competitor can come to design without infringing.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:12.200]   So the next step is for Apple to sue somebody, as always.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:22.760]   There is a new-- I understand you covered this on the Super Bowl. There is a new app store.com
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:31.480]   vanity URL. Did you see the ads that said app store.com/startrec app, for instance?
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.600]   It's not really new. It's just they made a big deal out of it at the Super Bowl. I think the
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:41.560]   Salesforce guy Ben Essoff gave it to Steve Jobs a while ago. They've been using it. So
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.040]   basically, anytime you upload an app, Apple takes the name of your app, removes any legal
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:50.760]   characters. And if you put that app store.com/ that name, it just works--
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:56.600]   App Store.com/pdfpen.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:01.640]   That's a work. It'll work for the names of Apple.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:05.000]   Names of companies. And if there's a conflict, it'll bring up a search page to show you the
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.760]   multiple results for that term. This is good to know from now on, we'll have to do this
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:16.600]   when we give out apps. It's not just for Super Bowl anymore. The URL shortener part is nice,
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.520]   but it also lets Apple be competitive. Originally, people would put the name of their website,
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:25.320]   then it was Search and AOL keyword, and then it's Facebook/ and now Apple has something that
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.480]   they can use in those kinds of marketing campaigns. So it gives them a good fight for mind shareback.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:41.560]   Let's try it. App Store.com/iStopMotion. Give Oliver a little external protocol request.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:47.240]   Remember my choice for all links of this type. Thank you. And now we go to the App Store and...
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:58.280]   Uh-oh. Uh-oh. That's wrong. Wait a minute. Let me try it again. App Store.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:06.200]   I think you've got a trade dress infringement, Oliver. I stop motion. I didn't type my...
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:15.640]   I typed I stop motion. And I get my stop action. Once again, the search in the App Store is so
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:23.800]   sucky that it now applies even to that shortened. Try Twitleo. Oliver, I'd be mad if I were you.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:30.600]   I think he is. Go talk to your friends at the App Store. Had you done this before, Oliver?
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:41.080]   Yeah, you knew it. Twitworks. App Store.com/Twit works. So wow, that's interesting. Can you
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:46.840]   specify iPad or iPhone or I guess not? It's just going to... It's doing a search it sounds like.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:52.360]   I wonder if that's what it's doing. It's... It does, if there's a conflict, if it's only one
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.760]   result, it gives you that one result. So if there's only one smile, it'll give you the company,
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.200]   if there's only one PDF pan, it'll give you the app. If there's multiple things...
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:06.040]   Yeah, but it got it wrong. It got... I did an I-Stop motion and it gave me my stop action.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:11.080]   I don't know how that works. Which is, that's exactly how that crappy search works in the App Store.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.640]   There are some scammy apps that try to game the system by putting names or keywords or they
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:24.040]   pre-pen stuff that gives bad results. Oh, App Store. Oh, App Store. Well, they are much
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:29.080]   better looking than the previous long URLs with the ID number and all that. I do like it.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.720]   I do like it. It got those. That's good. It's really nice to have those.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.200]   And they fit on posters and in commercials really nicely.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:40.520]   Hey, if you try to use Java on your Mac one more time, the second time in a month, Apple has
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:46.360]   blacklisted the web plugin. This is a nice feature that was added, I think in Lion, but maybe it was
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:55.800]   Mountain Lion, a kind of malware containment vessel that Apple has used a few times and it just
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.880]   blacklit. And it doesn't have to push out an update or anything, a blacklist, this stuff.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.720]   How do you know, does anybody know how this blacklist gets updated?
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:10.600]   It's part of their malware. They introduced an anti-malware feature. I think it was in Lion where
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:15.320]   they keep a list of things that like a malware removal tool, very similar to what Microsoft has
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:19.720]   had for years. And then they can flip a switch and say that this is now part of the malware
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:24.760]   program and it handles it as part of the OS. And it warns you it'll flag it, it'll block the plugin.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.680]   So what gives Apple the capability, which I think is very interesting
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:37.560]   to block a plugin automatically to protect its users. They had a lot of Java targeting as a
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:45.480]   dot update to Lion too, as Java became a bad problem and morphed into an insane problem.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:50.680]   So the question is, when you got the government telling you that for God's sake, don't stick
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.920]   your tongue in a light socket and don't run Java on any device, that's a problem.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.280]   So this technology called ExProtect, but again, I'm not sure how I understand that it does,
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:03.640]   but you don't have to have an update to get the ExProtect list,
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.280]   PList updated somehow, or do you?
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.760]   Yeah, I think you do, because in order for it to know to deactivate it, it has to receive some sort
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:15.080]   of change in Apple. So if you were offline, you wouldn't...
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.560]   If you were offline, you wouldn't, but I'm saying you won't necessarily get we have an update for
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.960]   you kind of stuff. It does that silently, right?
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.240]   Yes, it's a push, I think.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.200]   Yeah. I think that's really clever.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:30.120]   Does anybody feel like that's something bad?
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:37.000]   No, until there are a lot of businesses that use Java for like remote access stuff,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.640]   for collaborative and meeting stuff. But as yet, I haven't heard any
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:46.680]   widespread complaints that any of Apple's malware detections have stopped the wheels of
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:51.720]   progress. So it's just nothing but upside-wind. And everybody else doesn't use Java at all.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.120]   Everyone uses Java Script as parts of life pages, but it's incredibly rare that anybody has to
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:02.280]   actually activate a Java plugin to get a web browser to do anything these days.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:10.600]   If anything, Apple would be willing to do this not only as a way to keep its users safe, but
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:16.200]   also to underscores it, "Well, you see, that's why we keep telling you HTML5. That's why everything
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:21.160]   should be HTML5 and nothing should be a plugin. I mean, you know, we'll help you keep you safe,
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:26.760]   but this is why we keep plugging HTML5." So this is good. I'm reading from Intigo,
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:31.480]   and this actually started in Snow Leopard, how the any malware function works.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:37.880]   It's driven by this xprotect.p list file.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:48.440]   I'm trying to figure out how it does the Apple-- I don't believe they install Java by default
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.640]   either anymore. You have to go out and get it. So not only that, but if you install it and you
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.600]   don't use it for xnumber of weeks, it automatically deactivates it.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:02.120]   Yeah. And Safari always says, "Hey, are you sure you wanted to run this?"
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:05.560]   Really sure. As it should.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:14.200]   So this is-- Leander Connie in the Cult of Mac has everything you wanted to know about Apple's
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.760]   new antivirus spotter. This is back in Snow Leopard days, 2009, and there's a long article from
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:25.080]   Intigo, at least about how it worked then. I'm just scanning it to see--
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:30.440]   Yeah, it says software update will push it out, but maybe they've changed that because I think
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.000]   we don't get that many software updates, do we?
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.200]   No, I think it's a current process now. It just keeps current. That's what I think.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:43.560]   That's-- I think that's-- Windows doesn't do that. Windows will do it in the second
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:49.080]   Tuesday patch. They'll update their anti-malware scanner. But I think the ability to push out
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:55.240]   within seconds as soon as it's identified, an update to every Mac user is really good.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:59.400]   And it's a huge improvement to remember it used to be date where you go weeks or months after
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:04.360]   a long exploit was in the wild before an update would happen. So they're really-- I mean, they
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:08.440]   used to be so far behind Microsoft, and now they have Gatekeeper. You can turn off unsigned apps if
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:12.520]   you want to. They have random addresses. This is really good. Malware, yeah.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:17.960]   And notice that we did see a kind of a blip about a year ago in Malware for Apple, and it's gone.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:23.320]   You don't hear about it anymore. They've really taken the steps they need to protect us, I think.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.640]   To clamp down on people talking about Malware on the Mac.
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:34.360]   No more stories, notice. Zero. Well, see, that's why this file colon backslash, backslash,
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.440]   backslash. Well, let's talk about that. It's brilliant. We're going to take a break,
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:42.200]   and we're going to talk about that. Because that-- I'm going to do it-- has it been fixed?
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.800]   No, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it, but I'm going to wait till after the commercial, okay?
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:52.760]   LegalZoom.com. Let's talk about them. I wish I had them right now. Actually, they're not a law
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.560]   firm. They're basically let you do your own legal work. There's a lot of simple stuff you can do
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:03.720]   yourself walking through their step-by-step questionnaires on LegalZoom. Things like
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:09.160]   trademarks. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm trademarking OMGT. You should. Like right now.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.640]   Yeah. Well, you might want to finish the show before you just-- Oh, yeah. Oh, okay, go ahead.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:19.080]   It's-- yeah, see, there's a whole-- but it's very simple, and it's like 95 bucks, right? To trademark.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:25.240]   Yeah, and it's been-- yeah, I've answered about seven questions so far, and I'm into the usage area.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:29.480]   I think there are a lot of people who are watching who have blog names that they haven't really
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:36.600]   thought about protecting. Copyright's trademarks patents, they'll do NDAs. So if you've got something
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:41.240]   you want to show around and you want an NDA, you can do that. Of course, I would say probably the
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:47.640]   number one thing people do on LegalZoom.com. The top two are forming their own LLCs. That's what I did.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:52.600]   And doing their wills. I was going to say it was-- If you don't do a will, the government says,
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.560]   okay, well, we'll figure out what to do with your stuff, and guess what it's going to do.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:01.800]   So yeah, absolutely. You can do wills. You can do living trusts. I'm looking that up.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:08.280]   For $69, do a will. Really? Yeah. You don't have a will? You really ought to.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:12.920]   It's been on my to-do list. Yeah, see, this is the thing. I think this is-- a lot of us are like
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:16.840]   that. Well, I'll do it. But what you don't-- then you go, oh, but I'm going to have to find a lawyer.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.560]   I'm going to have to pay hundreds of dollars an hour. No, this is much simpler. And by the way,
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:28.520]   and they've added this-- and I think this is really good-- they now have a legal plan where you can
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:33.880]   talk to an attorney. They vet them. They choose them in each state. You can also get reviews for
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:39.080]   those attorneys. So you can pick one that you really like, and they have fixed pricing. So if
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:42.600]   you do feel like, gee, I'd really like to ask an attorney about this one thing, you can also do
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:48.760]   that. So an extensive network of attorneys, they have very inexpensive, very simple, and very effective
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:54.520]   solutions for a lot of the things that you don't need an attorney for-- wheels, truss, trademarks,
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:59:03.080]   LLCs. I literally did this. Twit is an LLC done that way. And by the way, since then, we have now
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:08.360]   legal representation as you have to, as you get bigger and so forth. And we're still operating
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:14.680]   under that basic LLC. It's fine. No problem. That's right. You can do a will in 15 minutes.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:19.240]   Yes, that's fast. I did the LLC so fast. It was a Delaware LLC. I had to-- I think that was one
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:24.040]   thing where I wasn't sure. And I might ask-- I had an attorney say, "Well, California,
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.240]   Delaware, and he gave me the pros and cons." And I said, "Fine. Continue through. You're going to
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:32.840]   love this. Go to legalzoom.com notes. One thing I'd like to ask is a favor. Use our offer code,
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:37.880]   MBW. And you'll get $10 off. People aren't doing that. And I want you to please do that so that we
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.760]   get credit for this because I know a lot of you are using legal zoom and you're saying, "Well,
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:47.000]   $10, I don't-- please. It's not for the $10. It's for us." And $10, it's not, you know, nothing to sneeze
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:54.600]   at. $10 off. If you use the offer code MBW when you use legalzoom.com, you absolutely should trademark
[00:59:54.600 --> 01:00:00.920]   OMG Chat and OMG Craft and OMG Everything. You should own that. Yeah. I don't want anyone else to
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.480]   come up underneath me. Believe me. I know a little bit more now than I want to about all of this stuff.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:11.880]   And it's-- if you don't protect yourself, you'll deeply regret it. Legalzoom.com makes it easy.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:16.760]   There's no reason not to. All right. So I have typed in my browser. Don't-- don't tell me
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:21.560]   not to. Because I'm going to do it. I bet you all did it, didn't you? I did. I bet you all did it.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:31.240]   I typed file colon slash slash slash, right? Is that right? And then I hit return. Capital F.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:37.880]   It has to be capital F. Oh, okay. Capital F-I-L-E. Now that shouldn't do anything bad.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:44.120]   Uh-oh. Oh, and it crashed. It crashed. But it didn't crash the whole system. It just crashed the
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:49.800]   far. It sometimes crashes multiple apps for me. Not all. Okay. It crashed Chrome. Yeah.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:55.240]   So it doesn't crash the whole computer. It just crashed my notes. But why? Why?
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:00.680]   Why? Mommy? Let me type it into a spotlight. F-I-L-E. Colon slash slash slash. Then what happens?
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:06.520]   Nothing. In fact, it finds a Walt Mossberg column. No, it did. It crashed spotlight.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.800]   And rebooted. No, it didn't reboot the machine. So can you crash a machine with this?
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.080]   What good is it? No, cascading failures, but I haven't had a whole machine go down. Yeah.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.600]   Let me try connect to server. Let's try that. File colon slash slash slash connect.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.800]   Nope. Oh, that's not good.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.920]   No, so far it's nothing horrible. It just crashes a program. So why?
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:37.960]   It's this infrastructure that it's it's infrastructure in the basic text edit
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.880]   and where what as you type Mac OS is looking for things that you might want to find later on,
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.960]   like things that look like phone numbers, things that look like addresses, things that look like
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:57.400]   discrete bits of data. So it's a it's a it's a it's a service that so many different apps use
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.840]   pretty much every app uses when it's trying to simply parse text that you're inputting.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.040]   And so I don't know the nature of the bug, but that's exactly what's happening.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:09.320]   And it's it's it's funny because I was going to say that this is this is a sign that unfortunately
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:16.680]   bugs are like evolving like DNA, because now that part of their survival is to never ever be found
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.160]   never ever to be talked about. So this is a bug that is configured itself so that whenever
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.680]   you're about to send an email to somebody saying, Hey, I found this bug if you type
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.880]   file colon slash slash slash boom, your email app app crashes, you can't report the bug.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.680]   And so it's allowed to propagate for another generation. Right.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:39.400]   Each of the machines is upon us. It's a transcription error that will soon lead to the evolution of
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.760]   all machine kind. People thought I was autocorrect, but it looks like it's deeper than that because
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.000]   it's data detected. It is whatever Apple uses to sniff and find and try to do smart things with
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.560]   the text that you enter in their default text entry box. I lover says but really who types that
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.440]   that's not the issue. Although it is kind of amazing. It was discovered because somebody must
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:04.520]   have typed it at some point and said, whoa, whoa, did you see what just happened? But,
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:10.360]   Oh, Chad, where are you going to do it in iMessage? Yeah, so that if you really want to,
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.000]   so it just crashed, if you really want to crash is without it even hitting return,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.720]   it just crashes. Right, just crashes. So, what if it works with the sky? Hang on.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:26.280]   If you really want to troll someone, send someone an iMessage that says capital F file slash slash
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:33.160]   slash and it will be saved in their history. And so, they won't be able to open up iMessage
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.680]   without it crashing. It doesn't do anything in IRC, unfortunately.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:43.880]   But, okay, now I'll tell you, having done security now for 15 years and listen to Steve,
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:50.120]   that that is a crash. You might say, oh, big deal, it crashes an app. A crash is always a precursor
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:56.600]   to an exploit because if you can crash it, then you're in the first stages of being able to make
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.520]   an exploit that will get it to run arbitrary code. Believe it or not, it depends on the crash,
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.320]   but almost always these are buffer overruns. They go, ah, okay, I can overrun the buffer.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.760]   Now, let's store something in the buffer and then do it and you can very often get an exploit out
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.520]   of that. So, it's usually something that jailbreakers are excited. Yeah, some to pay attention to,
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:21.720]   jailbreaking, exactly. If you can execute code in memory, you're golden. And speaking of which,
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.760]   the new jailbreak launched right after the Super Bowl evasion.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:30.040]   Then that's for iOS 6.1. 6.6.1. Yep. Awesome.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:34.520]   Does it work? Yeah, it works great. It's incredibly clever jailbreak.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:38.200]   The Apple's made it harder and harder to get around. By the way, I want to point out,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.160]   because there was a lot of misinformation about this, the librarian of Congress made
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.120]   unlocking a phone illegal.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:50.360]   Stupid. If you're under contract. If you're under contract, but it is still completely legal.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.880]   And they've said this several times to jailbreak. It is not Apple doesn't like it.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.880]   They've said so explicitly. They've explicitly made that legal.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:02.200]   And they updated their knowledge base today to remind you of the perils of jailbreak.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.080]   So dangerous. If you jailbreak your phone, the terrorists win.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.080]   Yes. They virtually said that. Tinkerbell dies.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.920]   They virtually said that because they said because then without honor,
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.840]   you could get bad stuff on your system and it could affect the whole network,
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.960]   cell phone network. It could bring the nation down. And then you have a blackout at the Super Bowl.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.600]   You see, by the way, rumors about that black out. The first thing I thought is,
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.120]   boy, we've been having a lot of my Twitter. I was one of the people who got hacked on Twitter,
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:32.120]   got the email that day from Twitter saying, Hey, your password's been changed because you got hacked.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:37.480]   Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Chinese hackers been attacking us very aggressively.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:43.080]   And then coincidence, the power goes out at the Super Bowl due to a computer failure.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:51.320]   Yes, an automatic trigger. Rumors flying. Rumors flying now about what that's all about.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.840]   And nobody will say, of course, it's the last thing you're going to hear Homeland Security say,
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.640]   yeah, we got hacked. You want me to get Adam Crow on the line?
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.480]   Or I'm not. I'm. Sorry. Sorry. I know what Adam thinks.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:10.600]   It wasn't Voodoo. We know that they've checked that out. And it wasn't the Niners. Although
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:16.680]   it worked out a little bit in their favor. I don't know. I just, I think that frankly,
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:23.240]   the Super Bowl is a high profile target for any kind of action like that. And if it was computer
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:28.440]   failure, which we do, I think we do know that there's a surge or something happened in the
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:35.000]   computers shut down the power to protect this, protect the system. If you're a hacker, don't
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.560]   you want to take down the Super Bowl? You are not testing out an EMP for Giz Whizzio? Well, you
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:45.400]   will you will I am not. The thing is you also want to have credit for taking out the Super Bowl.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:49.960]   But you would announce it. Even if even if you only took out half the lights, that's a win.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.960]   And you would announce it. You would announce it. So that's true. Nobody's taking credit yet.
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.200]   Actually, that's a good question. Why not? When you want to take credit,
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:04.680]   I mean, never, never addressed a conspiracy what you can chalk up to stupidity. Yeah. It's
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.160]   probably easier to believe someone fell asleep on the on the wheel or not. The file colon slash
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:17.640]   that's it. I think it was a Twitter. Try it out. It was a boon for Twitter because Twitter
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:23.720]   from that moment on became totally I said, I said more tweets in that one hour than I had
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:29.080]   sent in three years of Twitter. I sent out 20 or 30 tweets. Boom, boom, boom, because I had nothing
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:34.520]   else to do. And Twitter had one of the worst blog posts ever about their hack because they say,
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:38.200]   you know, Java has been a problem. The Wall Street Journal has been a problem. Oh, by the way,
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.720]   oh, and act. You should really go ahead and remove Java from your system.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:48.520]   Oh, it was it was a very it was a very like Apple style of response. It was like you would
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:52.600]   think that the most direct way to do this blog post is, oh, by the way, we've run a company,
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.520]   there's a security problem where people have been trying to where some accounts are compromised.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.360]   Please everybody change your passwords. Instead, they instead they title it,
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:08.440]   keeping our users safe. Yeah. You're welcome. Yeah. It was apparently a low numbered Twitter
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:13.400]   users, people in the first quarter million, which means if you became a Twitter user before the
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:19.560]   middle of 2007, I think you would have been affected. I was. Me too. Yeah. Which is annoying
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:24.040]   because Twitter is one of those things I sign on to like all the time. I changed my passwords
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:29.480]   sometime between 12 and 20 times a year. And I was I wasn't quite at the end of my cycle for
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:35.400]   this one password. And I wasn't ready to think of a new one yet. And so not every device is like,
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:40.120]   Oh, damn it. Okay, it has something to do with trees because I was looking out the window at
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:45.720]   the time and I saw what did I see? Damn it. And then I forgot about the stupid thing I was
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.200]   going to tweet anyway. Thus saving countless people. Lots and lots of frustration of seeing
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.320]   something stupid. I was going to tweet. So I just logged in. I hadn't changed it. By the way,
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:57.560]   what doesn't happen is all the tokens, all the apps that you've already approved continue to
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.480]   work. So you may not even notice it till you try to log into the Twitter website. But then
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.720]   that's that's an insulted passwords. They weren't just plain text passwords. Yeah, I think it's very
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.200]   unlikely that you they may got hacked because they were they were both encrypted and salted.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:15.160]   It's very unlikely. Anybody got anything out of it. But still it's a reminder of two different
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:19.240]   things. Number one, that there are a lot of people who are using the same password on multiple accounts.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:24.760]   And if you have the same password on Twitter and something else, not only change the Twitter
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.520]   password, but change someone else's password, change that other password to and don't do that
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:34.280]   same thing again. And the other thing is that you know how it is like when you're trying to find
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.040]   the right Twitter client, because you've just got a new phone, you might have downloading like
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.080]   eight or nine and trying a whole bunch of different things, or maybe you've tried out a whole bunch
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.640]   of different web services. That's not until you go onto that page that shows you all the apps that
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:50.040]   have been approved for access to your Twitter credentials and Twitter feed. They're like, oh,
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:55.240]   I use maybe seven of those 38. Perhaps I should deauthorize all the ones I'm not using it.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:01.880]   Yeah. I was amazed. Yeah, it was amazing to like into like, oh, I'm sorry. That's also an excellent
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.640]   point. Now they have a limited number of tokens they can use. So you're actually like being a token
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:11.080]   hoarder. Here's a big change for the folks at Instagram. You can now they have a website.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.440]   Only two years and a billion dollars later. Actually, I thought that was a brilliant
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.360]   move on their part not to have a website forcing you to have the app on your iPhone and then
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.440]   eventually on your Android phone to look at your pictures and other people's pictures.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.080]   But it kind of made you could click a link on Twitter and we'd open a page, but there was no
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:33.800]   way to browse any. But now Instagram actually has a browse ability. So I can go to my Instagram. I
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:38.520]   can look at the pictures that people have posted on here. And it just this is just like what you
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.920]   what you'd get on your iPhone. Look, here's an interesting one. Snoop Dogg apparently has
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:49.560]   found an unusual blend at Starbucks. I don't I don't is that Kenyan? Kona? I don't know.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.480]   And they took out their tweeching integrations and now it's even better to go to their website.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:58.840]   You kind of has to, don't you? Yeah. God, I hate it when companies do that because they're
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:03.560]   it's just disadvantaging their users for competitive purposes.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:07.720]   Well, Celio, Twitter doesn't want you to go to clients and Instagram doesn't want you to go to
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:11.640]   Twitter and nobody cares what we want. Nobody cares what we want. The we the people who have
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:19.160]   posted our own content onto these services, you know, Dell has agreed to be acquired by Michael
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:25.480]   Dell and Silver Lake. They are going to go private. This thing I was suggesting Apple do actually
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:29.880]   Dell has successfully done or seems to be they announced today that they're going to go private
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:35.000]   in a $24 billion deal led by Michael Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake, the biggest
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.280]   leveraged buyout since the financial crisis. Now Dell's only $24 billion. See Apple's worth
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.840]   a hell of a lot more than that. So not as easy to do. Apple could have bought Dell.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.440]   Apple could have taken eight Dell's billion. Yeah, probably.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.280]   God, what would that what I mean? That would be an interesting move, wouldn't it?
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.480]   Michael, why don't we get your money back to the show?
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:59.720]   Gee, Michael. Oh, sort of.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.560]   Meen or neen or neen or.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:08.840]   That that is kind of funny. Apple takes three of top five spots in the mobile phone sales for
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:15.640]   quarter, uh, four or 2012. Um, there, you know, people were thinking, Oh, maybe Android. No, man.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.920]   Well, Android is providing some competition. Apple has really dominated. This is the iPhone
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:28.280]   five, four S and four are doing very, very well. According to the NPD group, the iPhone
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:33.480]   five is first place. The iPhone four is third place. The iPhone fourth place. And of course,
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.200]   Apple is the best overall selling smartphone maker accounting for 39% of smartphone sales.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:43.480]   Samsung case, you're interested 30%. Not Android. Samsung.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:51.880]   Samsung is increasingly looking like the, uh, the Apple of, uh, you know, it's an Apple Samsung
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:13:02.200]   battle. Um, net applications also, they, they monitor via the usage, net usage. Uh, their monthly
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:09.160]   report on mobile OS share found that Apple iOS increased slightly accounting for 61% of all mobile
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:15.400]   operating systems. Android slight dip 25% that's one of the interesting problems. Apple has now.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.240]   I want to call it a problem is that their products have become seasonal when a new iPhone comes out.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.800]   The demand goes huge and they rocket to the top and then six months, nine months down the road.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.360]   It's still the same iPhone and smart competitors are now counter programming them with new devices
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:33.720]   towards the end of their lifespan. Uh, so we saw like massive galaxy sales, um, right?
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:38.760]   Quarter last year. Right. So as this might be why Apple is becoming more open to different
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:43.560]   schedules or maybe even different models at some point. Well, in fact, we're going to see the Galaxy
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:49.880]   S4, probably a mobile world Congress this month. Uh, a lot of rumors about the S4. It sounds like
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:55.880]   a very exciting phone for Android users. Uh, and then the rumor that the iPhone math or whatever
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.720]   the hell they're going to call us. What do you, what do you, what do you, I'm more is your,
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:05.800]   your website, Renee is the king of rumors these days. Thank you. What do you hear? My, uh, again,
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.360]   it's, it's really hard to hear. Uh, most of the stuff that leaks from Apple is for existing products
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.080]   because they ramp up the factories and a lot of stuff comes out of Foxconn. New products are
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:20.280]   much harder to predict because nothing, nothing leaks out until Apple is ready for it. But, uh,
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:24.680]   both the cheaper iPhone or the less expensive iPhone and the bigger iPhone, uh, start to make
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.000]   sense. We did some math and we figured out that if you take the existing iPhone display and you
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.320]   stretch it up to five inches, it ends up being exactly the same screen density as the iPad, uh,
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:39.800]   the iPad four. And that's interesting because the iPad mini did the opposite. It took the iPad
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:46.360]   resolution down to the iPhone density. So Apple is already buying those screens in huge quantities.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:51.000]   I put up some mockups so that you can actually, and I put them in the, uh, in the document,
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.920]   you can actually click on them and load up what the interface would look like on your phone.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.320]   So you can see what a 20% larger iOS interface would look like.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:04.440]   It's a lot like a Galaxy Note, frankly. It is. It's right in between the Galaxy S and the Galaxy
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:09.240]   Note and it is usable. It's especially for people with accessibility issues who find the existing
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.440]   iPhone text and buttons too small. It'll be a boon, but it's not comically large either,
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.720]   which is something I was worried about. So it has several advantages. It doesn't fragment
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:23.160]   the market because it's the same, you know, it's a, it's an existing resolution. Uh, it solves that
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:29.480]   we don't have a big screen phone problem. Um, I love this. Remember, I'm the one who's saying
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.960]   Apple should do an iPad mini with a phone in it. And then if you look at it, you have an 11 inch
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.600]   MacBook Air, a 13 inch MacBook Air, a 13 inch MacBook Pro and a 15 inch MacBook Pro. You have
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:43.240]   a four inch iPhone, a five inch iPhone, a 7.9 inch iPad and a 9.7 inch iPad. Yeah.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:49.080]   Mark Arman also had a good blog post on it that also, uh, explains that pretty well.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.120]   Uh, but it's, it's also fun. It's, it's, it's going to be fun to like sort of rewind every,
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.080]   every commentator that was saying that, no, no, no, there's no need for Apple to ever make a
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.560]   larger phone because there's silly and they're just, it's just marketing hype that doesn't have
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.600]   any practical benefit to it. Uh, yeah. I mean, I'd be very, very pleased if Apple comes up with
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:13.160]   a larger phone. I mean, look at the size in every way. This is a very attractive phone. Now,
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.520]   Tim Cook did kind of poo poo it. He said, look, we're very happy with the iPhone five design. It's
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:23.240]   a, we think it's exactly the right size because you can still use one hand and reach all the way
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.800]   across it. No, not way up, but okay. That's what he always, I mean, like there's no, I,
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.240]   no one wants to see a video on their iPod. No one wants a seven inch iPad.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.120]   What about when you, when you, when you only have the ability to make one phone a year,
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:40.040]   what else are you going to say except for the one phone we made is the best one that would ever,
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:44.040]   but you, it's the one phone that I would ever want. It's the best one that could possibly be made.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:47.800]   Right. So I feel that he wouldn't have to, he wouldn't have to eat crow,
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.840]   but coming up with a new phone. As a matter of fact, he would do again, again, one of those
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:56.200]   signature, we listened to you, we gave you the larger phone. You're welcome.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.960]   Today, Apple in vents.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.400]   Yeah. The large phone.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.760]   Yeah. And some people are worried about one hand that ease of use, but that's, that's not
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.280]   necessarily a hardware problem. Apple is very good at software. And with the iPad mini,
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:13.080]   the bezel disappeared, but they used software to reject palm touches. And if you look at Blackberry
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.840]   10, for example, there's a lot of interesting things you can do with software to make larger
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.080]   screen devices still easy to use with one hand.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:24.760]   Also, I mean, there's, there's a case to be made that it's not as though making a phone that can
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:29.160]   be, that can be used one handed is the end all be all that motivator is going to have to derive
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:33.400]   every aspect of this, of this device. I mean, there is nothing, there is nothing about,
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.160]   for me personally, there's nothing about a larger phone that is a disadvantage compared to
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:41.720]   what appears to me to be a very, very tiny screen that's, that's on other phones right now.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.800]   It's okay given given that even on the iPhone five, I can't really operate it one handed.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:51.800]   The fact that there's a keyboard technology in the Android phone that makes it easier to type one
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.440]   handed even if though it's a wider sweep makes it easier to use the fact that the keyboard is
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:02.520]   larger physically makes the targets larger for me and easier to hit. So it's, it's, it's not as,
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:07.480]   I really don't know why Apple keeps saying that that everybody wants a phone that can be,
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.360]   that has to be able to use one completely one hand.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.480]   That's what they make Andy.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.000]   And it's like, and it's like anything and you know what the, and you know what the signature
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.520]   move is going to be like when they, when they roll all the sounds. We have the greatest movie
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:29.080]   library, the greatest TV library. And now we have the greatest screen on a mobile device to show it
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:39.240]   off on your welcome. Apple TV rumors too, flying. There's an FCC filing revealing an Apple TV with
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:45.480]   slightly smaller dimensions. Some say it's just an internal upgrade with no difference in size.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.560]   That's true. You think that's going to be the case?
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.240]   Well, it is okay. I mean the FCC documents we're referring to the device without the external
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:55.240]   shell. We add the external shell to it. It's the same. The most interesting thing about this is
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.240]   it's a complete stealth update. You're just going to one day go to the store and you'll get the Apple
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:05.320]   TV three comma two instead of three comma one. But if you look Brian Kluget and Antech and Matthew
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.320]   Panzino from the next web did a lot of sleuthing on this. And the interesting thing, it looks like
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:15.480]   they might be using a die shrunk a five X processor in this as a limited test run. Now maybe that's
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:20.120]   to try a non Samsung manufacturer, or maybe that's to try out something that they might want to use
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:25.480]   in the iPad mini because if that ever goes retina, you're going to need that X for the extended
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:29.880]   graphics capability of pushing around all those pixels. And it makes a lot of sense. They did
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:35.240]   that previously with a die shrunk a five chip that went into the iPad two and was eventually was
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:39.880]   eventually was eventually put into the iPad two. So that device is not very interesting from an
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:44.200]   Apple TV point of view, but it's very interesting for a what's Apple going to do in 2013 point of
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:51.640]   view. The A five X is the same as in the iPhone five? No, in the iPad three, it's the same chip,
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.960]   but it was so big and hot in that in that body that it didn't really work out. They went to the
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:02.200]   A five the A six X, but a die shrunk a five X might be a good or an economical choice for a
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.600]   red and iPad mini, although I hope not. I hope it'll be an a six X or something new. Yeah, but it's
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:11.480]   one possibility. So Apple TV could take advantage of that extra processing power to do something
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:17.480]   like for instance, put HBO go. That's the other rumor on it. That would be very interesting. Now,
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:22.840]   if you have HBO go, now you still have to have a cable subscription currently to use HBO go,
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:27.480]   but that would put all your H cards changes that. Yeah, Netflix has the cards.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:33.800]   Got to be putting a little pressure on the old HBO. Yeah. Also, a lot of people don't know that
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:40.200]   cable companies will break out HBO from most packages. If you ask them, when I was when I went
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:46.520]   through the whole like refrah changing your cable service for plan is like refinancing at home
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.760]   sometimes. And it wasn't until like our four of the negotiations when I was upgrading my bandwidth
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.600]   here that I found out that, oh, well, instead of getting this instead of essentially spending
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:59.000]   like $30 for this package, because I only want one channel of HBO, I can actually just get HBO
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.200]   for 10 bucks. Oh, cancel everything. But the one channel of HBO. Thank you. Game of Thrones, ho.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:11.560]   Although the secret is you do have to essentially say, knowing full well, you have no intention of
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:16.040]   canceling HBO, you have to say, hi, I'd like to cancel HBO. Right. And you hear the wrestling as
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:20.120]   they turn to the page of the script. Oh, dear, I'm sorry. Why do you want to cancel HBO? Yeah,
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:24.600]   because well, because I don't want to spend $40 for these eight channels. Well, flip flip flip
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.560]   deep. You know that you just call retention. Who's your who's your cable company? Just so we know
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.680]   of rise and fires for rising. So that may not be the case with some other cable companies. We
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:38.520]   don't know. And I'll take this opportunity to say the Verizon was actually very every time I've
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:42.280]   made a service change on devices that I've owned with Verizon. They've done a really good job.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.680]   I just want to point out you have never looked so good. And that's thanks to Verizon.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:53.800]   Thank you. I'm using Parker Posey's dermatologist. It is. I mean, seriously, your skin is smooth,
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:22:00.120]   flawless. The tone is excellent. You just need the new Mac mini will be here tomorrow. And we'll
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.720]   see if we can get. I don't know if we need the new Mac mini, but I'm glad we got you that. We're
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.360]   getting a dedicated machine with enough horsepower. But but it's funny. The frame rate problems we
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:13.880]   had last week are gone. You're squirrel. I can see every detail on his tail. It's beautiful.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:20.120]   Isn't that he is really seriously? This is amazing. The quality we're getting as a matter of fact,
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:24.520]   it's so good when I saw a free frame grab, I'm like, perhaps I should go to Toys R Us and get
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.480]   like a top for Wonder Woman. Because now this may be a little bit too much. She looks like woman
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:36.200]   in those body painted women on the urban street there. Mighty Mighty, mighty Wonder Woman.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:42.840]   We knew before Chevy was going to have Siri. Now Honda has announced 2013 Accord
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:50.520]   and Acura models will have Siri. Which is a, you know, I think Ford really was the first to
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:55.480]   introduce this kind of speech driven interface. It's so much better than reaching down looking
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:00.680]   in a screen, twiddling a knob. And I think Siri, to be honest, as good as Ford Sync is, I think
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:06.760]   Siri is better. So I think the Siri iFree will be good. I mean, the question is, will it be as
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:10.680]   powerful a Siri as it is on the iPhone and iPad? And I don't know.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:17.960]   Also, there's no real battery. I guess you have to have an iPhone 4s or iPhone 5 running iOS 6.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.680]   So it's actually Siri on the phone.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:25.000]   I got it. Instead of a Bluetooth button, you have a Siri button.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:32.840]   Got it. I just hope that we don't see like a ceasefire in the development of better interfaces.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:38.200]   I think it's possible to, my usual rule of thumb, like what I'm evaluating the stuff that's
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:43.560]   designed to car technology is that here's how long it takes me to adjust the heating in my car.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:49.400]   If I can, if I can spare three quarters of a second to glance to the console and press
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.800]   a temperature up, temperature down, fan up, fan down button, and then put my ass back on the road,
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:58.840]   I don't think that's too much time to be spending looking at a phone screen. But we're talking about
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.840]   a half a second, three quarters of a second. I don't think that it's necessarily impossible to do
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:06.680]   that or unsafe to do that. But I can say, I can actually press a button on my steering wheel and
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.000]   say cabin temperature 74 degrees. And it's right.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.640]   But what I'm saying is I think that one of the big problems is that current phone interfaces are
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:18.680]   such that it will not take as little as a half a second or three quarters a second to do it.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:23.880]   And that's true. And unfortunately, and some of these interfaces that I see on some car dashboard
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:28.200]   apps, they really do try to make the interface as uncluttered and as simple and as big button
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:33.720]   as possible. And that's great. When I use Siri for a lot of things, though, oftentimes I have to
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:38.440]   settle for what Siri can understand as opposed to what I actually want to listen to.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.440]   Right. Where it's like, no, that's true. Play the Beatles white album. That's true. Playing the
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:50.680]   drugs. White writer. Yeah. Play the Beatles white album. Playing the English beat. No. Yeah. Play
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:55.000]   the Beatles. You do get beaten down eventually. Road rage against Siri. And then I'm heading
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.920]   for a bridge bump. That's a good point. I'm thinking about I tell I adjust the temperature. I don't
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:05.160]   use Siri to do that. Or my publisher just got the Tesla S and he was showing off that giant 17
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.800]   in screen with our website on it. And if I had that, my eyes would never be on the road. Yeah.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:15.480]   No, it's very distracting. Yeah. The Tesla S is amazing. Beautiful, beautiful vehicle.
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:18.120]   I'm taking a test drive and a Tesla S tomorrow as a matter of fact. You're gonna
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:23.640]   love it. I got the interface. I'm very tempted. That's a beautiful car. Oh, like, oh, I can
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:30.600]   I can never buy a Tesla. Well, it's expensive journalism. I mean, again, my it's it's it's
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.800]   it's a big deal when I went from having like the car cassette adapter to the Bluetooth adapter
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:41.160]   for my until someone takes Andy private. He's not. Yeah. Really was choice for me
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:45.880]   between going to the Super Bowl and buying a Tesla. So I've already made my decision.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:51.080]   I should get a refund though, because the Niners lost, right? Shouldn't I get some like half of that
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:56.920]   back? That's what they do here. Performance fee. You know, it's like half up front half to win.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.560]   Yeah. Yeah, I feel like you get a refund of some kind. Yeah, to show into play.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:06.440]   She get one of the 800 number lawyers on your side. Yeah, good. That'll work.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:14.200]   I I I'm just being no, and it was amazing. What an experience. Just so incredible.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:21.000]   Yeah. Never forget it. I was an extra once in a Super Bowl. Were you in a movie? Black Sunday?
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:27.640]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. In Miami. That's why I grew up. They did filming in the Super in the Orange Bowl,
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:32.520]   and they they recruited lots of people to come and be killed by a big scary
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:37.400]   blimp that we couldn't see, but it was a lot of fun. Oh, yeah, we'll paint that in later.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:42.280]   I'll say you got to see the good to your blimp from a very unusual perspective. Yes.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:49.080]   Yes, the invisible perspective. So I didn't ask anybody, and I don't know if it's even in the
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.680]   appropriate show to do this, but any thoughts on Blackberry 10? I think Andy, did you get
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:57.720]   played against playing with one? I wrote a column about it. I got a demo as a matter of fact,
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:02.280]   from the same guy who gave the demo during the press event about a month ago. I'm pretty
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.080]   impressed with a lot of the ideas in there. I saw a lot of basic ideas that I think are really,
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:12.200]   really quite strong for an interface that tries to make sure you never have to see an on-screen
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:17.240]   control unless you really need to see it. It's actually a surprising effective the velocity with
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.160]   which you can move through the interface and move through all the different apps very, very quick,
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.440]   using some very simple gestures. I really like the the keyboard is phenomenal.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.680]   Oh boy. I mean, it's so you had the physical keyboard one, you mean? Not the on screen.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.080]   No, no, no, no, the on-screen keyboard. Really?
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.880]   It's like we're used to like on the iPhone, there's
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:41.400]   it's like the best fusion of the way that the iPhone does it and the way that iPhone swipe,
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:45.560]   excuse me, Android swipe does it, where on the iPhone, of course, is predictive text where
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:49.480]   tries to predict the type of course, you know, what you're trying to type a lot of completed for you
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:55.080]   if you want. There's the swipe keyboard in which you're sliding from key to key and in doing so,
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.600]   you're giving more information about what you're trying to type and Android can use that to make
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:04.280]   better prediction. With this one, not only does it not only does it offer predictions, but it knows
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:10.760]   tracking the velocity of your finger and if you're typing, you're typing THi, it might be thing,
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:17.240]   it might be this or it might be Thursday, it might be therefore. And so what it does is it puts the
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:22.920]   auto complete like just as a little little hint on the top of the key cap of multiple keys. So,
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:27.320]   because if you're trying to type therefore, then you're probably going to steer towards this way
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.800]   anyway. So if you see if you're, so your eye is on the letter E, you say, oh, therefore, that's
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.480]   what I want. Let go and you get and you get the entire word. So instead of having to keep your
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:40.600]   eye off of the keyboard or instead of just getting just one suggest, you can just blow, blow, blow,
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:46.040]   blow through what you're writing. How's it hard? I feel Pete Master wants to know in our chat room.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:52.840]   Sturdy? Nice hardware. Nice. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a nice tight device. It's
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:56.600]   small. I mean, we're here, we've been saying how wonderful it is that Apple's getting for
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.000]   total object devices and how it's not necessary to have a one handed thing. But Blackberry seems
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.320]   to be very, very intent on no, this is a one handed device. You don't have, we're, we're taking
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:10.120]   things off the off the device to make sure that you have a good one handed interface. It feels
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:16.600]   like a very solid $200 premium smartphone. I don't know, I don't know how convincing this case is
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:21.960]   going to be for people who are walking into a phone store of their own volition because, you know,
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.040]   we were, we've discussed this time and time again that people go into a phone store really in the,
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:31.000]   in the US to buy an iPhone. And if they, if we're, if they aren't specifically looking for something
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.960]   with an Apple logo, I hope they'll find a lot of really great Android phones as all, as alternatives.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.760]   I'm not really sure that unless their company is saying we want you to buy a Blackberry or
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.000]   here's a Blackberry for you to use, that that's going to be their first choice. So at this, at this
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.880]   point, all I can say is that I think they have some really very strong fundamental ideas. I love,
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:55.320]   I love the way that, that it's designed so that you don't necessarily have to have the one phone
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:59.560]   that the IT department controls and has all this, all the company secure information on. And then
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.240]   you have to have a second phone just for your personal stuff, your personal photos, just to
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:07.880]   make sure that your privacy remains private and that IT can't accidentally remote wipe like your
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:12.520]   baby pictures because they need to push another app on your device. So again, lots of really strong,
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:18.520]   strong ideas. Let's see if a year from now, it's, it's an actually desirable phone for, for the
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:24.040]   majority of people out there though. Our, our, our sister site, crackberry.com, they cover everything
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:28.520]   Blackberry. So of course they're super excited about this. They rented an office in Toronto and
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:33.640]   they've all been living there 24/7, actually broadcasting at night, like the big brother house,
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:38.840]   their coverage. And they've had the devices for a while and they've got tons of reviews and videos
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:43.080]   up. And I've had a chance to see a little bit of it. And it's exactly what Andy says is, I don't
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:46.520]   know if there's room for it between the iPhones that people want to buy and the androids that
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:52.120]   carriers want to sell. But boy, are there some fantastic ideas and very different ideas like
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:56.600]   Blackberry flow and when you can peek at the notifications and then keep gesturing for the
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.840]   messages or you can go the other way and see the tiles or keep going and seeing the apps.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:05.240]   There is a discoverability curve just like the playbook because when you have a gesture based
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:10.440]   operating system, if you just hand the phone to somebody, it's not instinctive how to use it.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:14.840]   There's no big buttons to push. But if they educate people well and if they show it,
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:19.480]   I went to the stores this morning to see it launched in Canada today. So I went to the carriers this
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:24.360]   morning to see how it was doing and all of their stock had been pre-reserved. They were actually a
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:28.920]   wide demographic of people who were buying it. They were being shown how to put the battery in,
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.720]   how to use the basic functions because there's a gesture even to turn the screen back on and
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:38.280]   the carriers doing a really good job educating mainstream people to it. So it looks like there's
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:43.000]   some interest. I just don't know how much Microsoft hasn't gotten any traction in two years.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.560]   So I don't know how much. Jimmy DeGeek has a good point in the chatroom. He says,
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.800]   it's going to really be a battle for third place between Windows Phone and Blackberry. That's really
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:56.520]   worth it. But that's okay. I think that it's kind of go for any of us to think, oh,
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:00.200]   ha ha, you only have the third best selling phone in the world. That's fine. Yeah, well,
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.960]   you're still making tens of millions of dollars in profit. I'm sure that you and your shareholders
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:09.000]   are perfectly fine. And the other thing that I think people get too hung up on is discoverability
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.560]   and the ease of learning. Because I think that there are two different sides to a device that,
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.840]   or a piece of software that's easy to use. One really important part of it is how easy it is to
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.120]   learn it when you get this thing out of the box. You're going through those first days and even
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:26.520]   first couple of weeks of frustration as you're trying to figure out, I just want to answer a phone
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:30.920]   call. How the hell do I answer a phone call? But then there's once you've learned how to the
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:35.240]   basics of how to use the device, there's the ease of use that extends to a year from now.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:39.880]   When I'm looking at an email, I want to put that into Evernote. How many clicks? How many swipes?
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:44.520]   How difficult is it for me to turn this into an Evernote? Can I simply highlight it and then
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:51.400]   simply dump it off the screen and throw it into Evernote? Can I tap it? Can I tap it?
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:54.120]   Then tap a share button and say send it to Evernote or do I have to say,
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:33:00.760]   select all, copy, switch apps, Evernote, new note, paste in. There are all kinds of different
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:03.720]   kinds of ease of use. I'm very tempted to buy one, to be honest.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:08.200]   I had a chance to talk to Torsten Heintz, the CEO of Blackberry at CES. And he reminded me of the
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:13.400]   old school Ed Coligan because he was saying, I counted every tap and every swipe it takes to
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:17.480]   get something done in other operating systems. And he tried them all. He had all the different
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:23.080]   phones. And he was intent on making a very quick experience. And he believes there's space in that.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:27.640]   He believes that there are interface answers that other people haven't provided and that Blackberry
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:32.840]   still has room for. And again, win, lose or fail if those ideas become popular. And if they end up
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:37.720]   elsewhere, the keyboard is an update of swipe. It's the Blackberry's version of swipe. And that's
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.440]   really interesting. So hopefully those ideas will filter down.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:45.560]   Now I just went to AT&T's website and there's a big shop button. I'm not logged in, but there's
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:50.680]   a big shop now button. And what does it pull you to? It pulls you to an iPhone 5. It does not
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:57.080]   show you any other phones when you press shop now. You actually have to click further
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:05.400]   to get more than an iPhone. So you're exactly right, Andy. This is tough for any phone that's
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.640]   on an Android or an iPhone because there just nobody's going to show it to you unless you say,
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.480]   I'm here to look at the new Blackberry. And boy, if you talk about the difference between two
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.520]   companies, RIM, now they changed their name to Blackberry, they brought Kevin Mitchell,
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.520]   who runs a crackberry site up onto stage. He said he was not going to cut his hair till Blackberry
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:27.480]   10 launched. He brought him up on stage and cut his ponytail around the event. And you never see
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:34.120]   that happen at WWDC. That's awesome. Yeah, but you'd also never see like, you'd never see the sort
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:39.320]   of pre show that they put on for the Blackberry 10 event where it just, it felt like, I don't know,
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:45.000]   like a off market version of a New Year's Rock and Eve countdown, like someone who desperately
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.520]   wants to be Ryan C. Chris, but isn't. And like, you're not going to entertain us with somebody with
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.720]   a new girl band that debuted a year ago. Oh, he's not the boss of me.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:58.920]   I don't know. Okay. If you got Alicia Keys, give us Alicia Keys. Don't give us the guy who was
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:03.560]   interviewing, getting some ponytail off. And the other thing was it's like, if this were an
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.480]   apple event, not that not that they have to do things the way that Apple did, but you know,
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:12.280]   there's the clearly the scripted, but still not not embarrassing bit in which they're
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:17.560]   talking about the well, Alicia, we're we know that we used to be a big Blackberry fan, but we lost
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:22.680]   you to like competitor a couple years ago. And Alicia say, well, I have to admit that my head was
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:28.760]   turned by something sexier and newer and younger, but you know, you kept in touch and I kept looking
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:32.520]   and like, Oh my God, the curtains are going to part. There's going to piano back there. She's
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:38.520]   going to start playing. But then after we got back and touched, I started to I started to think
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:43.160]   about the things I loved about June, you changed since then and everything I didn't like about
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:50.920]   you made me love the all over again. No, she should be singing. We got Tony Bennett. We got you too.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:58.520]   We got we got the food fight is for God's sake. Learn from Apple people. It just costs a little
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:03.320]   bit more. Well, that was the same thing with the ads. I mean, you they have to educate people how
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:08.200]   to use this gesture. You why? But their ad is 90% people walking and 10% phone instead of 90%
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:12.120]   phone and 10% people are saying from by the way, Windows eight, you got to adjust you. I think
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:15.480]   you nailed it when you said gesture based you guys have poor discoverability and you got to do
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.800]   something about that. You're going to make it easy. Yeah. It's like keyboard shortcuts with no mouse.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:27.560]   Right. Exactly. From I'm more, Mr. Renee Richie is here from smile.com.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:32.520]   Jim McDonald from the Chicago Sun Times and the Anaka, we are going to get your picks of the week
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:37.960]   in just a moment. But first may I pick audible.com had long plane flights a lot of time.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:45.000]   I got to the Super Bowl the minute they opened the gates at one o'clock, didn't leave till 10.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.880]   There was a game in there, but for most of the time I was just sitting there.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:55.640]   Thank goodness for audible.com. A great place to listen to the best books in the world. 100,000
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:01.080]   strong great titles. All the new books now come out on audible.com. They've got business books,
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:07.080]   classics, fiction and history books for kids and young adults, mysteries, thrillers, romance,
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:11.800]   science and technology, a great sci-fi selection. Thanks to audible and their audible frontiers
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:16.760]   program. They're recording a lot of classic sci-fi and self development and a lot more.
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:23.960]   I'm listening to book two of the King killer Chronicles. Patrick Rothfuss is amazing trilogy,
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.280]   the third book of which has not yet been written. I'm deeply hoping he finishes it before I finish
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:34.040]   book two and that may happen given how long it is. I'm a few hours into book one.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:39.080]   So it's good. Is it not good? Yes. So good. This is the book Trey Rachliffe said,
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:44.600]   if you read this and don't like this, I cannot be your friend anymore. I'm nine hours and seven
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:48.520]   minutes in. I still have 18 hours to go. Oh, you're about you're about you're a third of the way in.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:56.040]   That's the name of the wind. That one's 27 hours and 58 minutes. The second book is 42 hours and 59
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:02.280]   minutes. Wow. Can't wait. Yeah. And it's and it's you know, it's it's holding up. It's very good,
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:08.520]   very well written, kind of a sordine sorcery fantasy world, but mild fantasy very much like
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.680]   Game of Thrones where there's a little bit of magic, but not a huge amount. It's really about
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:19.160]   characters and plot and very, very beautifully written. But if you're not into that kind of thing,
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.120]   there's many other good choices. I just I think my next my next one is going to be Silver Linings
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:29.000]   Playbook. I really liked the movie and apparently the book is even better. It predated the movie,
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.080]   of course, and it's apparently even better. So that's another great choice.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.560]   I got stuck at the airport because of freezing rain and I had almost no battery life left and
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:45.240]   I listened to Audible the entire time because it takes so little battery that I I lasted 19 hours
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:49.800]   on this. Awesome. And the Audible app on the iPhone is a must because your entire library is
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:54.440]   available to you. They have an Android and Windows phone and even a Metro version for Windows 8.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:39:00.600]   Andy, what are you listening to these days? I hate to sound so lame, but sometimes I will
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.840]   like a movie so much. And if it's based on a book, I will find it wind up actually getting the book
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:10.120]   and reading that. And I love I finally got around to seeing the descendants that George Clooney
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:16.840]   moved to such a good movie. Yeah. And it was it was directed by the same guy who did sideways
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:22.520]   with Paul Jimani. And it's the same kind of a story about a middle aged man who's at kind of a
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:29.480]   sad point in his life. And it's not a his life, his death, his struggles. It's here is one specific
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:34.440]   short period of time that basically teaches you all about this person, how they react to the world
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:40.360]   around them. And so it's available based on a book based on a really wonderful book,
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:46.840]   download the book and it just adds so much like like sideways, which is a first person book.
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.280]   It just adds so much texture and so much. It really it really does live as as a separate sort of thing.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.480]   And not giving anything away. It's not the sort this like sideways, it's not the sort of story where
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:02.920]   once you once you find once you know who the killer is, once you find out the identity of
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:08.440]   Kaiser Soze, the entire movie is over with. And it is actually still don't know who was Kaiser
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:15.160]   says they said, don't tell me nobody does. I know I really we're talking about audible here,
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:21.800]   but my God, I bought it on I want to have an abiad on on Blu ray and then Blu ray and D V D
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:27.960]   DVD and ripping a copy. And I must have seen that movie in the past two years, at least twice a month,
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:32.520]   because it's just such a great talk about the usual suspects or the usual suspect. Yeah,
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.160]   the descendants but the descendants also but another good movie but not usual suspects good.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:41.000]   That's unusually good. What I what I'm saying is that even if you've seen the movie and if you're
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000]   familiar with the basic storyline, the fact that it's it's more like a different telling of the
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000]   story that adds that that's a totally unique experience. I don't know itself. I'm completely
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.320]   with you and I usually try to listen to the book before I see the movie, but I in both cases,
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:57.800]   silver linings, playbook and descendants. I did not. And I mean, there are a lot of audiobooks
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:04.120]   exactly like that where it's it's not quite very safe to watch a movie while you're driving. But
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.960]   you know, if you've already seen the movie, hearing the audiobook gives you that same sort of, Hey,
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:12.760]   I really enjoyed the story. I want to enjoy the story again. I just don't want to drive off a cliff
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:17.080]   while I'm enjoying this movie inside the car. Highly recommended. Look, here's the deal. You
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:21.800]   can get a book free and get an idea of what audible could be for you. It's something important in my
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:27.080]   life. I got to tell you, and Renee Riches and Andy and Naco's How about you, Jean? Books.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:32.440]   Audiobooks. Have you done that yet? Have you done it yet? So I when I go on a road trip, I do
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.760]   have them. It's great. It's great for a flying and driving. I get the life of Pi right now. If I
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:42.040]   was going on because I read it a long time ago, then I saw the movie, which was amazing. But I got
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.520]   to tell you the audible version of Life of Pi is the definitive you if you haven't. Yes.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:52.120]   If you haven't read the book, absolutely must listen to Audible's Life of Pi in
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:56.680]   credit. Okay, then I'm told incredible. In fact, it's often the book I recommended for
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:00.440]   your first audible book. Interesting. So if you liked the movie and you didn't haven't read the
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:06.280]   novel, you must get the audio version. Audible.com/Macbreak get you a book free. You're going to sign

[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:41.400]   Audible.com/Macbreak. We thank them for their support and Macbreak Weekly. Andy Enoco,
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:47.720]   your pick of the week. Short and simple and kind of old. I finally got around to selecting the
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:55.560]   winner of the long podcast downloader app for iOS pageant after finally being so frustrated with
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:00.520]   the Apple podcast app. That's like, now I got to try them. A category that didn't really care
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.520]   much about. Now I'm going to try everything. One of them. The clear winner for me is Downcast.
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:12.280]   Oh, yes. I want an app where all I want to be able to do is add podcasts to it. And after I add
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:19.000]   podcasts to it, I want it to automatically download them on a schedule that I can control and that
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.120]   when I again get into the car or start taking my walk, I want to be able to launch the app,
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:29.880]   hit play, and it's automatically playing the podcast that I like in the order in the starting
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:35.000]   with the newest ones ending with the oldest ones. And if there's a podcast, I don't really get to
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.000]   immediately. I want to replace that three week old podcast with a brand new one. And oh, God, so
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.280]   many so many of these apps screw up something or other. This is just the most simple, direct,
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.920]   and it's also very clean. It's very pretty. And also doesn't hurt that they have a version of it.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:57.160]   The same version you buy for the iPhone is also for the iPad that actually expands the interface
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:02.360]   and makes it more of a really cool console app too. So hands down my favorite there. There are others
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:06.840]   that are very, very good, especially if you want to have something that's multi platform. If you've
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:12.360]   if you want one for one for your Android stuff, one for your iOS stuff, one for your desktop,
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:18.120]   but for for a good replacement for the podcast player that functionality that Apple effectively
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:23.880]   removed from your device by adding a really, really crummy player app. It's it's downcast.
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:28.280]   It does video to really recommended it is absolutely agree with you 100%. There's some other good
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:35.080]   choices, but downcast is the one I use as well. That's from Gemma Gemaukana productions.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:40.280]   Gemaukana enterprises enterprises. And you know what app store.com/downcast works for this one.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:45.000]   App store.com/downcast. I was about to say that that kind of defeats the purpose. Now all I have
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.280]   to do is remember instead of the instead of that long URL, you'll never gonna remember just remember
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:57.640]   it will be the app store. Gemaukana.com. Thank you. App store.com/downcast does work. Thank goodness.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:03.960]   Those of you who can't spell Gemaukana. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:08.520]   I have one and a half. I have follow up from a previous pick. I mentioned ano style a few weeks
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:13.640]   ago. They'll take your iPhone and they'll re anodize it in any color that you want. But since I'm not
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:17.880]   a Kardashian and didn't think I could pull off gold, I asked them if they could do real black
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:23.080]   because the current iPhone is slate. It's not black. And they hadn't done it before. So I
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:29.320]   bought a new iPhone and told them to experiment with it. And they put four layers military grade
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:35.400]   andodization on the back of it. So it is no longer chipping like my original iPhone. And it's still
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:40.520]   understated. It's not I mean they'll do red or orange or whatever color you want. But I stuck with
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:47.080]   the the black and it turned out better than I thought it would. I'm very happy with it. A-n-o-s-t-y-l-e.
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:53.560]   You Renee, you are exactly I mean this in the most positive way. You're exactly the reason why
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:58.120]   Apple customers are the greatest customers in the world because they're not happy with black.
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:03.720]   They have a perfect shade of black in mind. And they're willing to put themselves through
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:08.200]   trouble to get exactly the right shade of black. You could be Joni Ives assistant.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:15.000]   It's a really good. I will avoid your warranty. People ask about that because if it's a different
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.440]   color, if you take a bright orange iPhone back to Apple, they'll not be happy with you.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.640]   They won't trade it back in. But if you're interested in something different,
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:26.920]   my pick of the week though is something actually quite different. It's a game that Arnold Kim
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:31.800]   from MacRumors turned me on to at Macworld. And it ended up causing a lot of fun for a lot of people.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:38.280]   It's called Space Team. Oh I love Space Team. You got to come over. We can have a Space Team party.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:43.160]   I should have done it last week. I was negative. It would have been so much fun. So you basically
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:48.280]   connect over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and then you take turns. It gives you instructions and they're
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:52.840]   either for your device or for the other person's device. You've got to yell out instructions and
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.160]   try and find them on your screen. And the whole interface breaks apart while you're playing.
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:03.480]   It's incredibly stressful but incredibly fun. And especially watching a bunch of Apple press
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.480]   people playing this during the off hours and just losing their own. It's hysterical. It's hysterical.
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:12.920]   Yes. And you're shouting. And it's a family thing. iPad or iPhone.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:24.280]   It's not. It's fun. It's like a pit or one of those other family fun games or you're all
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.760]   shouting. Step one of the installation guide is take any guns or sharp knives out of the room.
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.600]   No, no, no. It's not competitive. It's really cooperate. Have any family arguments before
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:38.280]   you start playing this game. You have to cooperate to make it work. And it's really fun. I have to
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:42.840]   say we tried several times to make it work here and crashed every time on us. But we were using it
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:46.680]   for via Wi-Fi. I think Bluetooth is probably a better choice. Yes. And it worked great. We had
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:51.240]   it. We tried it at a party. We tried it at Moscow and it was just phenomenal. And it's free, right?
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:55.160]   But although they do have in-app but 99 cent in-app purchases.
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:02.200]   Yeah. I love Space Team Henry Smith app store.com/SpaceTeamworks as well.
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:03.720]   Nice.
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:06.920]   G. McDonald smile software. What's your pick of the week?
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:11.960]   I have to go with Omni Focus this week. Even though they had no booths.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:15.720]   Even though they had no booth. They put on an all day Omni Focus.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:19.720]   Basically a mini conference. I would like to do that.
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:23.080]   Extra, you know, with their extra super Omni Focus ninjas.
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:25.560]   You almost need to have some training to use this thing.
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.920]   Well, that was the- but the end of the day they showed off Omni Focus 2,
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:38.600]   which is going into beta right now. And they acknowledge that, yes, you need like,
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.920]   you know, you practically need a two week course to understand how to use Omni Focus.
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:49.880]   And the beta looks fantastic for two. They definitely made things more obvious.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.440]   And they're also going with a pro and a standard edition.
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:49:00.840]   So if you're not going to be like the super tweaker GTD person, you might just be
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:05.400]   happy with the standard. And then they made Omni Focus 1 free now.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:13.400]   So if you want it to start using Omni Focus before the new Omni Focus 2 goes live,
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.000]   you can get it for free.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:23.160]   I think it is hard to use, but I finally hit my stride in Omni Focus and I'm really excited about it.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:25.400]   So you know how to- you're good and you know how to use it.
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:30.120]   I don't know if I'm good, but I'm better. And I understand why people find it
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:37.320]   hard to get started because I've had it since it was, you know, Omni Focus 1 since it came out.
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:41.560]   Yeah. And I've never quite gotten it. But certain combination of
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:44.760]   screencasts that I've watched and books that I've read,
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:53.160]   I get it now. And I think it's worth it. So if you're interested, I would go to
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:56.360]   Omni Focus. I don't know if you can still sign up to be on the beta,
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:59.720]   but you could definitely get Omni Focus 1 for free, which I think is worth
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:01.240]   if you'd been thinking about trying it out.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.760]   I didn't realize that you could get it for free. That is a good idea.
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:06.120]   Now's your chance to do it.
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:13.080]   So I, as you many of you know, upgraded my MacBook Pro retina with the other world computing
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:18.920]   Aura Pro, which is a great SSD drive, a little faster, a little bigger. I went to 250 gigs.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:22.600]   And then one of the things I got with it, which is awesome. And you can buy this stand alone,
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:27.080]   is an enclosure for the old SSD drive. So you know, you say, well, I got it. In fact,
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:31.800]   I bought a retina with a 256 gig drive, I think or something like that. I didn't want to waste it.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:37.880]   So you pop it in this. This is awesome. This is like machined aluminum. And now it's got a USB
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:46.840]   3 interface to the solid state drive. This is awesome. Super fast. It's almost as fast as the
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:55.800]   internal drive. And now you've got an external drive that you can attach to your laptop. So
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:51:03.400]   really, really nicely designed, very elegant. If you're going to buy the Aura Pro SSD and take
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:10.760]   it out of your existing MacBook Air or MacBook Pro with retina, then you definitely want to get the
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:16.040]   external case and upgrade it. It really is fantastic. I'm trying to see what the pricing
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:21.240]   on the standalone of the external cases. It's just really nicely done.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:23.640]   It's very nice looking. Isn't it beautiful?
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:29.160]   It's it's a, let me see if I can find it here. Voipro, V-O-Y Pro.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:38.280]   Yeah, Envoy is what they call it. $79.99. Good price. You need to have that particular Mac
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:43.800]   SSD drive. So it's really only going to be for people who have upgraded their Mac
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:49.960]   SSD drive. It's bus powered, USB 3, and it's so elegant looking. So beautiful machine
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:54.440]   aluminum. And you need that because you have to have some cooling aspects to it.
[01:51:54.440 --> 01:52:01.320]   So this will work with the modules in the 2012 13 and 15 inch MacBook Pro with retina,
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:08.120]   not for the air, I guess. You could, I guess by an extent, you could buy
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:13.560]   this and then buy the SSD from then the Aura Pro SSD and put it in and then you'd have this.
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:18.040]   What I'm going to do with this, I think it's 250 gigs is I'm going to use this as a for my
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:22.360]   photos when I travel because it's light bus powered. And that'll be an external drive I can use in
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:26.600]   my photos. Envoy Pro from other world computing. Were they in that world? I hope they were.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:33.080]   Max sales. They're the best. They're fantastic. It's maulish booth on the left hand corner.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:37.800]   I still buy all my stuff from them. Very, as always, they have the instructions. It comes with
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:44.680]   the Torx screwdriver that you need to both open your computer and open this. And so you don't need
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:50.120]   a special screwdriver. And yeah, there's a there's a video on the other world site that shows you
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:54.040]   what it looks like and all that stuff. And the speeds I was getting are just phenomenal. Just
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:58.200]   basically on USB three, it's the same speed as an internal. It's just really great.
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:03.080]   All right, that's it for our edition of Mac Break Weekly, the post-Mac world episode.
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:08.920]   So nice to have you, Jean. You going back to Oregon next? Yes, I am. And the heaven studio
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:14.680]   audience Oliver, good to have you as well. Oliver Brydon back from Boinks, B-O-I-N-X. They make
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:18.920]   great video switching software. Of course, I stop motion, which is a must-have for the iPad or the
[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:29.160]   Mac. You got to have it. Great program. Jean smilessoft.com. Smile software.com. And of course,
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:33.080]   it's text expander, which I don't know how anybody lives without. It's the main reason I know it
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:40.520]   uses Windows. And no, it's not the only reason. And of course, PDF, pen and PDF, PIMPRO.
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:45.560]   Do you have any, is there a new, anything new coming along? You want to tease? She can't
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:50.920]   chip linking at me. She can't. She won't. Thank you for being here, Jean. Thank you,
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:57.240]   Andy Inako from Chicago Sun Times. Thank you to Verizon Fios for making you look so mama-less.
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.400]   And are you recommending the Lost Squadron as your movie of Pick of the Week?
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:05.960]   Is that why that's on the screen behind you? I'm definitely recommending the movie poster.
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:11.240]   It's a great poster. It's a great poster. Especially this guy right here. Yeah.
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:19.000]   It's a 1932 action film starring Richard Dix, Mary Aster and Robert Armstrong.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.880]   Exactly. The best poster ever. I've never seen the movie, but I do like the,
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:27.320]   yeah.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.000]   Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Ahem. Yeah.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:38.040]   RKO radio. I like the beginning of this RKO radio pictures. I want to kind of use that as a,
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:43.000]   yeah, I almost use that as our twit beginning because it has a radio tower and lightning bolts
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.120]   coming out of it. And it goes, did you? I thought that would have been great for twit,
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:49.080]   but then I thought, oh, there's probably still somebody who's suing me over then.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:55.240]   Hey, thank you everybody for being here. We do Mac break weekly at 11 AM Pacific when I'm here on
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:58.680]   time. I wasn't again, but I will next week because I'm canceling that class that I've been going to,
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:04.920]   making me late. 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time. That's 1900 UTC on twit.tv. If you want to watch
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:09.560]   live, you can get audio and video versions after the fact though. We've make on-demand versions
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:19.880]   available on our website, twit.tv/mpw or on iTunes or on our new YouTube channel, youtube.com/macbreakweekly.
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:26.040]   Is that right, Chad? Mac break weekly. Yes. Yes. Yeah. All three words. And you can subscribe
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:33.240]   there so you'll always get an automatic email when there's new shows available. We've got quite a
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:38.760]   few on there now. That's good. And of course, the main twit channel is youtube.com/twit that has
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:42.600]   directory that listing for all the shows in their individual YouTube channels. We move them to
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:48.520]   individual channels just so that you could subscribe to show by show instead of getting every show
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:54.600]   in your feed just to make it easier. Hey, thanks everybody. Time to get back to work now. Break time.
