[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.560]   It's all coming up.

[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.640]   news from Apple.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.200]   And of course, we're getting close.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200]   We're in engine in.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.800]   Hello, Jason Snell, six colors.com.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.240]   Good to see you.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.360]   We're in the silly season is just around the Corn and Elio.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.800]   It is.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.600]   That's why Jason has a human-sized box, a stack of boxes
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.240]   to his right.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.000]   I thought we weren't going to talk about that on the end.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.920]   Let's not talk about that.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   It's time to ship out the old and ship in the new.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.880]   Andy Inacos, so here he is with WGBH in Boston.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.680]   Will you look very-- did you change cameras on us?
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.520]   You look sharp.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.760]   No.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.680]   The thing is, I moved to--
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.280]   I'm in the kitchen, believe it or not, not in office,
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.480]   for various reasons.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.200]   So we have David and me.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.920]   Well, I've basically redone my lighting.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.320]   And finally, maybe this is showing me, maybe I should
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.400]   have rearranged them.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.760]   Maybe I should have rearranged my lighting a while ago.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.560]   It looks good.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.160]   Is that a Red Sox red t-shirt?
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.920]   Almost.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.200]   I will give you a second guess.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.800]   And I'm sure you'll guess correctly the second time.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.160]   I need to 49ers.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.680]   No.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.400]   No, you were the--
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.440]   Pothakit.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.400]   The Pothakit.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.840]   Let's see.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.360]   Pothak.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.040]   Pothak.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.960]   The Pothakit sucks.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.080]   I love the Pothakics having spent a few years in--
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.040]   Not the Worcester Pothakics.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.440]   Not the Worcester Pothakics.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.000]   They moved to Worcester.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   They moved to Worcester because Pothakit
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.360]   were not build them like a brand new stadium.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.240]   And so--
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.800]   Are they the double A, triple A?
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.320]   Right in.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.840]   Single A.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.120]   Triple A. Triple A.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   OK.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.280]   A lot of great ball being there.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.720]   It was so--
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.680]   It was so cool being able to like build Durham my way
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.120]   into baseball games like six times a season.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.760]   It's so fun.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.040]   It's close by, always seats.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.760]   And everyone wants to make it to the big.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.920]   So nobody's being tentative about sliding catches.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.440]   But they still got on the Pothakics.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.000]   Not the Woosocks.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.920]   But they decided-- now they decided their decision was,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.560]   instead of Poth, or Pothakics was always
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.160]   like the nickname because of the Pothakit Red Sox.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.600]   So Worcester said, well, look, it's still
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.280]   a trademark.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.480]   So we're going to say that our mascot is a big polar bear.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.960]   Oh, I get it.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.040]   He has a ball.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.640]   Get it off.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.360]   Patrick De La Hante, who is a maniac,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.840]   says the double A is the Portland Sea Dogs in Maine.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.520]   All right.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.720]   Give some love to your triple A and double A teams.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.440]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.720]   Even your single A teams.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.480]   Because that's like-- if it ever
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.160]   bumps you out that like you spent-- oh my god,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.320]   I spent 100 bucks for a halfway decent seat
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.680]   to a major league game.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.320]   And I'm being shuttled into this place
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.960]   to make sure that I can't be mixing with the Hoidy,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.120]   Toidy, Hoidy, Poloys.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.240]   Go to a minor league game.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.640]   The concessions are cheap.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.680]   The tickets, like for 50 bucks, you get amazing seats.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.320]   And again, the level of play is just really, really great.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.760]   Again, the Pothaks moved out, I think, two years ago.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.040]   But I've been missing him ever since.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.440]   Oh, it makes me sad.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.800]   Also, here, a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers,
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.680]   even though he lives in Niners Country,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.740]   Mr. Alex Lindsey from Office Hours.Global
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.120]   and 090.media.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.320]   Hello, Alex.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.840]   Hey, I'm pretty excited about the whole quarterback thing
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.920]   in Pittsburgh.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.840]   Who's the one to come?
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.760]   Who's QB now?
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.320]   We don't know.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.200]   We don't know who the QB is.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.400]   Hey, we got one you can have.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.960]   It looks like Kenny Pickett.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.000]   We got this guy named Garoppolo.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.960]   You want him?
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.120]   No, we got three.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.480]   We got three good quarterbacks and one that looks like he's--
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.160]   We do two.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.840]   We actually are going to have to cut one of the two backups,
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   I think.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.920]   And that would be a shame because it both looked pretty good.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.280]   Anyway, NFL's coming.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.920]   That's why we're talking about this in baseball.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.320]   This is when baseball gets exciting, too, in the fall.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.960]   But you know what's most exciting about September?
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   September 7th.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.520]   Well, I thought you were going to say the September issue of Vogue.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.720]   I'm a team Vogue guy.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.220]   Sorry.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.160]   This is now-- Mark German says, no, no, really.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.720]   This is it.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.160]   This is not-- this is a rumor, but I have it
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.680]   on very good authority.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.920]   He's putting his money where his mouth is that weirdly,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.360]   this is the one that you actually think Jason said,
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.000]   it could happen.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.480]   It would be the Wednesday after Labor Day.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.320]   It could happen.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.720]   And it looks like it might be.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.440]   I didn't say it was going to be the best choice.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.520]   I thought the following Tuesday.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.000]   But they did.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.920]   So 2016, I think, is when they did this last year.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.960]   I remember that, yeah.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.880]   They didn't want to wait the extra week just because Labor
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.520]   Day was fairly--
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.760]   was at the point in the calendar where they really
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.040]   didn't want to put it off another week, Labor Day
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.920]   on the fifth.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.840]   And so they just said, we'll just do it on the seventh.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.960]   We'll give everybody that extra day and do it on the seventh.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.200]   It's also suspicious, right?
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.680]   Because by doing it that way, it kind of
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.160]   implies that they're going to invite people somewhere.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.200]   So because otherwise, you don't really--
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.520]   they could just do it on a Tuesday.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.080]   And it doesn't really matter.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.360]   So it's possible-- still out there as a possibility
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.280]   as they might invite some press down
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.640]   to do the sort of like a version of what they did for WWDC.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.480]   But definitely, there's a precedent they did it in '16.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.640]   And it was definitely a possibility.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.480]   And so we're going to get a Wednesday Apple event
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.240]   the first week of September.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.480]   I think didn't German say it would be.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.240]   The press would be invited.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.920]   No, it was a possibility, right?
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.280]   We just had hedging a little bit.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.240]   He didn't say for sure.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.560]   I think Apple greatly benefits by having members of the press
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.080]   get to do their briefings in person
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.520]   and hold the products in their hands.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.640]   And the moment they feel like it's safe enough to do that,
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.680]   which again, they had lots of rules for WWDC.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.200]   We had to show proof of vaccination,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.320]   and we had to take a test, and we had to be masked,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.880]   and all of those things.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.240]   But we were able to go into the briefing rooms
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.360]   and get our hands on the products, and that was good.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.000]   So and that benefits Apple.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.400]   They want to make that happen, because then the press is not
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.680]   just writing abstract stories about a product
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.720]   that's on video.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.360]   They're talking about the products that they actually
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.120]   held in their hands.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.680]   And that's better for everyone.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.920]   So I think they're inclined to do that if they can get away
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.320]   with it.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.360]   And I think that I don't think that actually presenting
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.480]   live is necessary.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.720]   And in fact, it slows it down.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.000]   So most of us watching doesn't--
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.080]   it actually makes it worse.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.880]   Make it tight.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.400]   But having--
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.200]   Make a show out of it.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.240]   Just show us a video for an hour and a half.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.960]   But I do think that having the press be able to play with--
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.720]   so you still want to bring people to Apple Park.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.960]   I think people--
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.520]   there's-- oftentimes people will say, well, press won't come.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.680]   If it's not a live presentation, I'm like, press is coming,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.120]   because it's Apple Park, and because you get to play with a gear.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.720]   Like, whatever's on the screen or the stage,
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.160]   or whatever.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.160]   I don't need live.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.520]   I don't care.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.200]   That's right.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.200]   You feel that way too, Jason?
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.440]   Has somebody actually goes to these things?
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.720]   It's-- look, I mean, it's all stagecraft.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.560]   And the fact is that 99.999% of the people who
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.200]   are watching this thing are not watching it in person.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.720]   So I think the reason for Apple to do it
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.600]   at something like the Steve Jobs Theater,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.760]   and actually have a crowd there, is for stagecraft.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.160]   It's that they do like the live in front of an audience who
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.880]   can applaud and whoop and do all those reactions.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.800]   The applause is good.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.440]   You're right.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.400]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.160]   So I think in the long run--
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.080]   Jason, I mean, well, no, they bring in VIPs and Apple
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.280]   employees to do the applause.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.800]   Yeah, who's applauding?
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.640]   Oh, no.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.960]   They stack the deck.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.640]   They've been doing that for several years now,
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.240]   where they make sure that there are people.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.400]   It's not just like all press.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.280]   The press are in the back, and then Apple invites,
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.680]   and Apple employees are in the front.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.160]   And they're the ones who are doing the aggressive cheering
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.360]   before the thing is even finished with the sentence, right?
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.560]   But I could see them having-- seeing that as having value.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.720]   And in the long run, it wouldn't surprise me
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.800]   if they do something that is a hybrid of what we've seen now
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.600]   and what we've seen before, which is way more produced videos.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.360]   But maybe with a few segments where Tim comes out and says,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   now we're going to show you this and runs a video.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.240]   And then some other Apple executive comes out and says,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.480]   now we're going to show you this.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.800]   And she does two minutes feeling and runs a video.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.720]   But I think they probably--
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.280]   maybe not.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.040]   But there's probably value to be had in having the live
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.440]   before a studio audience aspect of it at some point.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.400]   But it's certainly not necessary.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.720]   I think just introductions, please,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.640]   just one or two minutes of introductions.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.000]   And then going into a video would be fine.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.320]   As a viewer, I don't really care.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.640]   But I do think, most likely, this one will be outside again.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.160]   I think that we're still--
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.640]   while COVID has not proven to be as lethal as it was before,
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.320]   every large group that I know of--
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.320]   they keep saying getting together.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.600]   People that I know, like they--
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.840]   SIGGRAPH was just a couple weeks ago,
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.480]   and a huge number of people got COVID.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480]   Oh, really?
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.280]   So pack a bunch of people together.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.520]   And so I think that Steve Jobs Theater is probably not--
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.040]   Do it outside.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:17.240]   --in the car.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:17.600]   --for those two.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.480]   I think they'll get it outside.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.040]   That would be nice.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.240]   The weather will still be nice in September.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.920]   In fact, that's another reason to hold it earlier in September.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.160]   Better chance that it's going to be sunny.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.360]   And that Cafe Max location that they use for WWE--
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   That's like on the far side.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.520]   --they didn't have it out on the grass.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.360]   But it's so huge that you could do it,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.840]   even if there was a threat of rain,
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.440]   you could just push everybody back about 40 feet.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.080]   And everybody would be undercover.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.600]   --on your shelter.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.480]   So it's-- yeah, I think in the long run,
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.360]   the question is in a year or two,
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.440]   do they try to bring people into the Steve Jobs Theater again?
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.760]   But in the short run, I think the real question is,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.400]   are they going to try to get press down there
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.120]   to get their hands on it that day or that week at some point?
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.200]   And I think they want to.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.040]   And WWDC, it actually worked fine.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.120]   If you take the press component and not the developer
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   component, it was a small group of press.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.520]   And we were kind of led around.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.760]   And we were led into very specific areas.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.800]   And we had to be masked.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.400]   And we were kind of brought in for our briefings
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.840]   and then sent away again.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.520]   And it was manageable.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:20.320]   And it was not a shoulder to shoulder kind of scrum inside,
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.920]   other than when they-- there was that briefly.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.120]   But it was a small group.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.360]   And then we were all masked.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.480]   And so I think it's a good approach for them to take.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.880]   And I kind of assume they will, because it benefits everybody
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.560]   to have people actually touch the products.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.080]   It was--
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.760]   Completely agree.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.240]   And you all know this, too, right?
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.520]   Like, watching a video is not the same as getting your hands on it.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.720]   It makes a real difference.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.560]   You come in there with a small list of questions
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.080]   that you know that you can solve just with a few minutes
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.960]   with a device.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.160]   Like, I'm going to definitely have my old iPad next
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.920]   to this new iPad, so I can see if there is a change in the display
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.600]   quality.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.680]   I am definitely going to want to see how big--
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.040]   I know how big the margins are by measurement,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.800]   but does it feel like I've got a big desktop?
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.640]   Does it feel like wide margins?
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.080]   I mean, you don't have--
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.160]   obviously, you're not going to get to be there
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.000]   with your screwdriver and your pentalobe
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   and your heat blankets to take it apart to see, OK,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.680]   so what kind of a GPU is it using on it right now?
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.160]   But there are some things that within the space of five minutes
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:23.840]   you can check out.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.640]   And also, when you're trying to talk to somebody
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.400]   about the impressions that you got off this product,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.680]   you like to have the authority of being able to say,
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.520]   hi, I read the press release.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.800]   And I saw the prepared video that Apple produced.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.960]   And now here's my opinion.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.640]   It would at least five to say, OK, well, actually,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.440]   I only spend about five or 10 minutes with it,
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.280]   but here are the first hand impressions that I got.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.080]   This is not a review.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.920]   That's going to have to wait for about a month.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.800]   But at least here is what I thought
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.520]   as I was holding this for the first time.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.840]   So how else do all the YouTubeers get their first look
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.040]   videos right?
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.840]   Exactly.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.320]   And mobile devices are devices meant to be held, right?
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.920]   So holding an iPhone, looking at the different colors,
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.920]   holding a laptop, like the M2 at WWDC,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.680]   we got that M2 MacBook Air.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.040]   And I got to pick it up and hold it and look at the different
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.440]   colors and look at it in the light
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.240]   and see whether that midnight had blue in it or not.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.520]   And the act of holding a laptop or an iPad or a phone
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.680]   makes a difference.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.320]   It really does.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.120]   Even if you don't get a chance to run tests and live with it,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.040]   even a short amount of time, it can help.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.640]   So it does benefit.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.160]   I do have to ask you this, though,
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.200]   were they surreptitiously wiping it off after everybody held it?
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.400]   Oh, not even surreptitiously, Leo.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.240]   They just wipe.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.320]   Look, you go to one of these hands-on areas
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.040]   and there will be an Apple minder by every single product.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.080]   There are ones roving, but there's also one for every product
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.600]   and they have a cloth.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.720]   OK?
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.400]   Absolutely.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.600]   Micah has his midnight blue.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.480]   And he showed it to me on Saturday.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.440]   And it is disgusting.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.040]   And Micah is a clean person.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.840]   It's disgusting the way that midnight blue picks up
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.440]   fingerprints actually turned me off that color.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.440]   Well, I mean, nobody used my fingerprints to verify me.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.240]   But there you go.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.320]   Chris, out Leo.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.720]   You know, it's my favorite color.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.840]   By the way, we should mention that you have put the six color
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.400]   apple on top of the shiny, mint blue apple.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.000]   Yeah, you get that as a decal on Etsy.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.400]   It's great.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.240]   It looks really pops.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.160]   I do that on my face.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.200]   Look, they wipe down everything no matter what.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.080]   And they do it anyway because of COVID.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.800]   But the midnight, I'm sure they're like, no, no, really wipe down.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.760]   It's fingerprinty.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.840]   And by the way, Micah says, and I'm sure you agree.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.600]   He says, I'm in love with his laptops.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.360]   Worth it.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.120]   Yeah, worth anything.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.880]   Since I can live with some fingerprints.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.280]   And honestly, it gives a fine patina.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.160]   Fine patina.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.840]   Oh, is that what it is?
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.800]   A patina of grace?
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.960]   For your hands.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.880]   And grace.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.240]   What they say on Antiques Roadshow,
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.680]   that's just good honest wear.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.180]   Yikes.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.360]   This is what Mark Gurman wrote on the Power On.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.240]   By the way, Mark was on Tech News Weekly on Thursday.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:58.800]   So watch that.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.880]   We were showing it a little bit before the show began.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.000]   So he expounded upon this.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.080]   But this is what he wrote in the Power On newsletter on the 21st.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.560]   The event will be on the Wednesday after Labor Day
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.480]   and a typical day for Apple product launches.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.600]   It signals that the company wanted
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.120]   to leave that Tuesday free.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.960]   Maybe Mark's too young to remember the fact
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.280]   that Apple doesn't like to do an event that day after a holiday
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.680]   because it makes people work over the weekend.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.920]   But he says, why?
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.680]   Perhaps because press and other guests
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.000]   will need a travel day after the Monday holiday.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.560]   The approach strongly suggests-- so this is your right--
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.680]   speculation, not what he's heard.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.120]   Strongly suggests the company will host an in-person event
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.640]   on its Apple Park campus for the iPhone launch,
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.520]   similar to what it did for WWDC in June.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.880]   The presentation itself-- Alex will be happy to know--
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.120]   will still be delivered online just as Apple has done
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.920]   with events throughout the pandemic.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.920]   But the company may also show the video live to a crowd
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.520]   at its campus.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.160]   This sounds to me like speculation
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.880]   as opposed to what he's heard.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.040]   It also just takes-- the reason that most likely it'll still
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   stay without any presentation is the presentation is so costly
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.320]   when you do it at the level that Apple does it out,
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.720]   where there's so much gear, there's broadcast trucks
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.160]   and all kinds of other things that happen.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.160]   It's not like a little web-- this is not a webcast.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.800]   It is a full-on broadcast.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.000]   It's bigger than most people's TV network shows.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.480]   And so it becomes very expensive and very painful
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.200]   to do that, whereas play video, you play--
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.400]   play video on it.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.360]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.320]   It's relatively straightforward.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.400]   And there's another factor that, at least when
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.960]   the classical events that they used to do,
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.040]   it really was quite disruptive to the Apple campus,
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.480]   where it's not just, OK, we can rent a catering truck.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.920]   We'll rent this video truck.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.880]   We'll rent this.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.520]   A lot of people who work at Apple
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.480]   have to spend a couple of weeks and then the whole day.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.960]   Oftentimes, you'll find that you don't know who it is,
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.600]   who's showing-- you've asked a random question of,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.280]   because you just saw someone with an Apple logo t-shirt on.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.840]   And it turns out that this person is actually
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.160]   an engineer who absolutely knows what they're doing.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.080]   And you're thinking, why are you answering questions for me?
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.400]   You should be developing the next piece of wizardry
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.360]   and wonder, but yeah, it can be very disruptive.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.840]   So maybe this is another opportunity
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.800]   they're seeing that we can basically manage how much we're
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.120]   going to be downsized in terms of productivity
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.800]   in our time by holding these events,
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.960]   by doing it pre-taped and really controlling how many people
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.240]   we have on campus who are actually taking a look at this stuff.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.720]   But remember, this is right about the same time
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.000]   they're going to make everybody come back to campus.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.360]   So everybody will be there.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.600]   And everybody's really on board for that.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.880]   I think they couldn't be more enthusiastic.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.880]   Oh, they're so excited.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.840]   Apparently, there's a petition going around Apple saying,
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.600]   please don't make us come back to work.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.880]   I mean, this is relevant, but there's actually
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.920]   a registered outbreak of COVID on Google's LA campus.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.080]   Oh, boy.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.880]   And not like, oh, well, geez, everyone's here.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.280]   They're taking a look at all of COVID numbers
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.000]   from all the different offices and all the different mining
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.920]   points throughout the city.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.200]   And Google has been noted as, yeah,
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.880]   there is a certified outbreak on the LA campus.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.040]   And that shows you that that's not just people who
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.240]   want to stick to the-- oh, gosh, we've had this taste
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.360]   of wonderful work at home and we want to continue.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.600]   We don't see any reason to.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.640]   A lot of people are like, look, I don't
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.920]   want to mess around with COVID.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.240]   As it is, I've got a husband and I've got two kids that
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.800]   are all introducing COVID randomness
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.520]   into the dice roll every single day.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.320]   If I can stay home and keep myself a little bit safer
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.040]   and also keep my family safer, you
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.640]   have to give me a really good reason why I absolutely
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.000]   have to be in the office in order
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.800]   to approve a presentation that I could have just done
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.240]   by clicking an email.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:46.280]   The Apple Together Twitter account published the petition.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.040]   Are you an office-based Apple employee?
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.760]   Are you less than thrilled with the return to office mandate?
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.160]   Sign the petition.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.400]   Better call soul.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.240]   Yeah, it does sound like that, doesn't it?
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:00.480]   Let's tell Apple we demand flexible location, flexible work.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   It's funny, Fortune Magazine says Apple employees say they're
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.920]   doing great work at home.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.480]   It's probably not true.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.440]   Thank you, Fortune, for that vote of confidence.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.120]   So there's the petition.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.920]   We do need to say that they haven't
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.840]   responded to any requests on how many people actually
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.160]   signed the petition.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.000]   So interesting.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.720]   So we don't know how popular or how big a video this is for--
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.800]   now what I do know is I have a lot of people
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.520]   I know personally that already left when the first announcement
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.040]   was done and just literally just said--
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.840]   So if you're people are signing that petition.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.760]   Well, I think that you're going to see more likely--
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.120]   you'll see more likely employees just leaving rather than signing
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.920]   it is a really great way to cap your career.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.680]   So it's going to be hard for them to sign it.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.120]   But the problem is for Apple is that they will have a lot
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.760]   of people who may not quit immediately.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.720]   But they're going to prep their LinkedIn
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.640]   and they're going to start talking to other people.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.360]   And again, we talked about this before.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.000]   Every time it comes up, that you don't want employees halfway
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.840]   in, halfway out.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.600]   It's not a great way to run a company.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.880]   I think that those folks may be more frustrated
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.040]   and more likely to go somewhere else.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.840]   It's three days.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.480]   It's one flexible.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.600]   I think that what's going to happen
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.560]   is be really busy from Tuesday to Thursday.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.600]   And then Fridays and whatever managers
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.080]   that you have come in on Friday is going to be not popular.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.040]   So I think that they'll have three solid days that are there.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.760]   And that also makes it easier.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.200]   Someone lives in Tahoe or has moved somewhere else,
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.920]   come down and they have a little apartment
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.120]   and they'll come and work Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.720]   And the problem is the chances of them
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.960]   working very hard on the other days
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.920]   because they're bitter that they had to come down.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.920]   It's gonna be low.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.280]   You know, like, you know, like, you know, like, and so,
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.560]   so all of it creates kind of a, it's hard to tell
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.760]   because I mean, there are some valid reasons
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.240]   that a company may want to maintain culture, maintain.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.160]   There's a lot of conversations that happen at Apple
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.400]   that you can't necessarily, you don't want to necessarily
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.320]   do over video because someone could record it
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.080]   and someone could, you know, put it up.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.000]   And so there are things that you want to look at
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.640]   and talk about that are more difficult
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.560]   regardless of how effective the employees are,
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.360]   are more difficult to do online,
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.240]   even if you have some kind of little watermark
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.360]   bouncing around or anything else,
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.880]   it's still difficult to have some of those conversations.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.880]   And so I think that there are some valid reasons
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.640]   to bring people back in, but I think that they are going,
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.800]   any company that says people have to come back in
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.040]   is going to lose, the unfortunate thing is often lose
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.240]   some of their best people because they're the most mobile.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.840]   They're the ones that can get a job, you know, anywhere.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.360]   It's going to be hard to keep them.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.240]   - As we mentioned last week, Apple says,
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.840]   you have to come on Tuesday and Thursday
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.120]   and a third day determined by your boss.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.280]   And as you're pointing out, any intelligent boss
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.000]   will make that day, Wednesday.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.920]   - Yeah, like I think it's just going to,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.480]   I mean, they could have said all these other days,
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.360]   maybe the team will get together and all decide
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.800]   they want one day or something.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.640]   I don't know.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.920]   I mean, but I have a feeling that it's going to be
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.080]   pretty, pretty heavy Tuesday through Thursday.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.920]   - Yeah.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:04.880]   - I love this.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.240]   This is Tristan Bovey writing at Fortune.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.400]   Apple employees claim they're doing exceptional work
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.600]   remotely as Tim Cook orders them back.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.240]   They're probably wrong.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.440]   - Are there no prisons?
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.400]   Are there no work houses?
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.240]   - I don't know how Tristan Bovey would know that,
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.240]   but okay, fine.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.920]   - I mean, you know, it's sure.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.000]   I mean, I don't think it's a matter of whether they're
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.120]   being effective or not.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.400]   I mean, I think that it's a matter of,
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.240]   can they have all the conversations they need
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.600]   and are those things that they believe are social?
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.920]   I don't think Apple's really trying to say,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.440]   you weren't getting work done and we want you
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.800]   to come back in so we can check on you.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.320]   I think it's really more of a cultural slash
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.720]   cross pollination thing that they want to do.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.560]   - But...
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.320]   - I think that you don't get the Apple by being lazy.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:50.240]   - Unfortunately, it's become now a power struggle
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.680]   between management and those employees who weather
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:59.600]   explicitly or under the table are not happy about it.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.960]   And you don't, you know, I mean, I always say the best
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.520]   play time to look for work is when you have a job.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.640]   - You don't want your employees when to foot out the door.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.160]   - Well, especially from Apple, I mean, like, you know,
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.040]   that's a pretty great seal of approval.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.840]   If you get through, if you get to work at Apple,
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.400]   it's usually a pretty, you know, you can get a lot
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.320]   of other jobs, especially if you're remotely.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.240]   So it is going to be an interesting thing.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.520]   They're going to force this.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.280]   And then there's a lot of companies that are very
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.240]   aggressively going after Apple employees
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.160]   and other people who are saying you have to come back
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.160]   to work, even like Google, you know, has, you know,
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.440]   Google and Facebook have location based, you know, pay scales.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.520]   And so if you, you know, if you're not coming back
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.640]   to the main mountain view, they're going to pay you
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.240]   25% less or 10% less or whatever.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.800]   And I know, I also know folks that have just like,
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.120]   they got a 25% pay cut, they did the math
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.520]   and took another job that was about the same as that 25%.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.560]   It was the same amount of money.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.120]   Just wasn't working for Google anymore.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.960]   - Like they were just mad.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.720]   - There is something great about saying,
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.480]   I work for Google or I work for Apple.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.040]   That really, I know from people who do,
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:06.880]   that's a point of proof.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.960]   - There's a great point of proof.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.600]   - To have said it at least.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.720]   - Yeah, like the best of hard parties.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.040]   - Actually, in a way, isn't that real credit?
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.280]   - Yeah, it was to work for Google,
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.440]   but you know, I decided to do it my own thing.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.840]   It's like even better.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.160]   - The easiest time to get a job is when you work
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.000]   for one of those companies.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.840]   - Absolutely.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.680]   - Yeah.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.680]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.520]   - So it's hard.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.560]   - So I do feel like this might be a,
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.480]   intentionally or unintentionally a struggle.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.160]   Remember, employees now are very much more empowered
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.800]   than ever before.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.720]   And this might be a struggle between management employees,
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.160]   a pure power struggle saying,
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.600]   whether it's the right thing to do or not,
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.800]   we're saying you come back and you better come back.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.120]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that again,
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.480]   the real power struggles is employee retention.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.240]   I don't think you're gonna see a bunch of big protests
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.520]   and I don't think you're gonna see a big decision
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.120]   that's signed by a lot of people because that's suicide
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.680]   from a career suicide.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.840]   Like as soon as you put your name down,
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.000]   you're not gonna move up.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.120]   You might as well quit now.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.080]   And so I think that that's not gonna really be like,
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.960]   we're not gonna see some drama about it,
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.360]   but what we are gonna see is employees leaving.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.200]   - Yeah.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.600]   - Yeah, and let's see what it'll be like in five or 10 years
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.760]   where you've got the situation that,
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.320]   you know, you're gonna see like,
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.520]   it's this churning thing where you're gonna get
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.400]   a key valued employee and they're gonna say,
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.280]   I'm gonna have to leave because I'm gonna relocate.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.640]   And they say, no, no, no, we'll let you,
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.000]   we'll let you work remotely.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.440]   And so that person's gone and that'll keep happening.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.920]   And then they'll lose other people who say,
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.160]   I wanna relocate and they'll say,
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.480]   or I wanna be remote and they'll be like, no, no,
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.080]   we'll lose, they'll lose them.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.240]   And then five or 10 years pass and either you suffer
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.160]   the brain drain and you feel really bad,
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.240]   or I suppose you find out that you're so powerful
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.360]   that you can dictate terms and not miss a step,
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.840]   but I suspect that's not gonna be the case
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.000]   and it's gonna be the latter.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.640]   And I think what motivates a lot of the people
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.000]   who are doing these petitions and things
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.320]   is saying, Apple, don't learn this the hard way.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.040]   Like we all learn during the pandemic
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.840]   that we can do this job this way as it is.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.720]   So maybe you should recalibrate your corporate culture.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.400]   I think that's a little naive in the sense
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.400]   that you don't ever recalibrate a corporate culture overnight.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.360]   It takes years and it takes the hard way for that to happen.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.720]   And I think that will happen,
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.480]   or they'll have a brain drain and feel really bad.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.520]   San Francisco Chronicle is reporting 400 signatures,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.640]   which is nothing.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.000]   But you're right, it could be three times that
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.720]   who are thinking in their head.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.360]   - Okay. - Foot out door.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.520]   - And it's not gonna be about this one issue.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.080]   I think that a lot of this investment is about
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.120]   we want to keep the troops happy.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.680]   We want them to believe that if they have an issue,
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.240]   we will discuss it and once their voices are heard,
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.480]   we will not only nod and give you like a sticker saying,
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.240]   congratulations, we heard your stuff,
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.800]   but you have an ability to actually affect change,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.160]   small and large to this company,
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.200]   because resentments tend to build up
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.640]   and if you don't give in on things
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.200]   you could easily give in on.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.400]   In two or three years time,
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.680]   now you've got a groundswell of support for unionizing.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.760]   Not just for the people who are working at the Apple store,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.200]   but I'm talking about the people that are putting in big bucks
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.200]   and are realizing that some people above a certain pay grade,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.360]   yes, they can get whatever they want,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.400]   but once they get their screw you money,
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.520]   meaning that they know they can work whatever they want
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.680]   or they have enough money saved up
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.000]   that it doesn't really matter where they work anymore,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.360]   that's when altruism tends to,
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.480]   that's when you can afford altruism, when you're rich,
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.120]   you can afford to make the big grand gesture again
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.280]   and say, you know what, I know that I'm a highly paid engineer
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.480]   with 15 years with experience,
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.880]   but I'm gonna throw my full support
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.520]   behind this unionization effort because,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.800]   oh my God, this is terrible
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.600]   and this is not the Apple that I grew up with
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.640]   and blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.360]   So yeah, and that's the big fear
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.320]   of every large tech company in the world today
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.240]   that we just hope to God,
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.560]   we don't have to submit to collective bargaining
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.000]   with our employees, we want to be able
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.960]   to push them around a little bit.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.480]   - Well, and I have to admit that,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.920]   of the folks that I've known, you know,
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.040]   that at some of these companies,
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.280]   they're, the complaint usually from the folks
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.320]   has not been that a company gets too rigid,
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.600]   it's that they're too soft and they allow people to do this
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.960]   and they're like, we're just trying to get a job done
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.640]   and these kids are all doing whatever.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.080]   And so it's just an interesting puzzle.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.760]   It depends on how long you've been there
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.480]   and the old version versus the new.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.880]   So these are all cultural issues
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.080]   is that the older employees at a lot of these companies
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.240]   think that the company is coddling,
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.880]   the kids way too much.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.720]   - That's right.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.880]   - You know, and so the--
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.720]   - It may be their very most important employees are saying,
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.800]   no, no, we want to come back.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.280]   Don't let these kids get away with this.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.240]   That may be-- - And the reality
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.840]   is going back to headquarters,
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.200]   makes a big difference for those
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.080]   who are trying to move up the corporate ladder.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.280]   And so if you don't have FaceTime,
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.000]   if you're working at home,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.800]   you just, if you enjoy the job that you have,
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.160]   you're in a good stead.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.840]   If you are, if you think that you want to move up,
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.520]   then everybody kind of assumes that moving up
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.160]   means being at Mountain View or Menlo Park or Cupertino.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.000]   And the reality is it's just a lot slower
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.400]   if you're not there.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.800]   - Is it related that Apple has canceled the contracts
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.960]   about of a hundred recruiters,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.400]   contract recruiters who handled recruiting?
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.160]   - This is also from Mark Gurman.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.000]   - I think that everybody's kind of bracing
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.960]   for what's going to be,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.560]   just, you know, everybody's slowing higher.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.520]   - And you know, everyone's hanging on right now
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.520]   to see what happens next year.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.040]   There's so much in this--
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.280]   - We are. - With so many--
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.120]   - You know what, we are.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:32.960]   - There's so many variables.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.360]   You know, whether it's recession--
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.800]   - Lisa and I are having this conversation,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.920]   what's going to happen, what's going to happen?
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.280]   I mean, we are, every business is doing this right now.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.120]   What's going to happen?
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.440]   - Everybody's hedging, and it's not just,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.840]   I mean, the big thing,
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.680]   there's the recession,
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.800]   but that's the little problem.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.080]   There's Taiwan.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.920]   - Right.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.560]   - That is what nobody knows what to do with.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.560]   Like if China does what Russia did in Ukraine,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.840]   like, are you going to be able to politically make phones?
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.120]   And we can see this in India right now,
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.720]   that was like ramping up.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.560]   - In Vietnam, yeah.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.720]   - Yeah, and so trying to get out of that.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.480]   You know, like, but in all, you know,
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.880]   they're all, most companies are looking for solutions
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.760]   that aren't in China,
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.920]   which is really, I think,
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.400]   we talked about this in previous weeks,
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.720]   but just really expensive for China,
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.160]   for it to make, to not allay people's fears,
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.360]   you know, over something that I don't really know
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.080]   what they think they're going to get out of this.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.600]   - So if the Apple event is two weeks from tomorrow,
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.920]   when will you get your invitation, Jason?
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.280]   - Well, they usually do it about a week in advance, right?
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.720]   So I would say next Tuesday or Wednesday,
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.080]   they'll probably be invitations.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.920]   - Right after you would get a discount to press.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.440]   (laughing)
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.280]   - Well, I mean, yeah.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.120]   - He could drive.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.080]   - I feel for all my colleagues in the press
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.280]   who have to fly to,
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.760]   and which is almost all of them,
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.840]   that have to fly to the Bay Area for these events,
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.280]   since I just give him a car and drive down to 80, right?
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.120]   - You know, but it's also really
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.920]   to get a little puddle jumper and--
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.000]   - Yeah, fly.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.680]   - That's what Elon Musk could do.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.840]   Fly, my friend.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.760]   - Fly.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.560]   It's only a nine minute flight in China.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.880]   - Hoping he'll Zeppelin and just float on down.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   - No, he probably used him 22.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.800]   - He asked for like $5 billion of taxpayer money
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.080]   to build a tunnel that only accepts Tesla cars.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.240]   - Let's pour a tunnel underneath.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.080]   - From Mill Valley.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.560]   A tunnel from Mill Valley to--
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.400]   - That's a command.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.240]   - That would be awesome.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.080]   - Let's do it.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.080]   - Now it's two.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.000]   (laughing)
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.680]   - That's how you keep workers coming in.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.520]   - You don't come in?
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.000]   - Give 'em a tunnel.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.920]   This is your own private Apple tunnel.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.600]   All right, let me take a little break.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.960]   We have much more to talk about.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   I'm not gonna spend time talking about
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.200]   what Apple might announce on September 7th.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.120]   I've we've done that,
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.400]   and I'm seeing so many people saying,
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.560]   I've seen articles saying,
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.720]   well, you're really, if you have an iPhone 13,
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.560]   you should get the 14,
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.200]   as if they know, like, we don't know.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.320]   It could have a giant, you know,
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.920]   it could have an X-ray camera
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.400]   that lets you see through people's clothes.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.320]   We don't know, so it's a little early to decide
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.520]   whether you're gonna buy this or not.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.760]   We will let you know September 8th about that.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.200]   Or even the 7th.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.320]   We will, of course, if Apple has an event at 10 a.m.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.240]   on Wednesday, September 7th,
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.600]   Micah and I will come in here,
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.520]   and any of you guys who want to as well,
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.320]   it'll be the day after Mac break weekly.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.440]   We'll cover that.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.440]   What do we do?
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.240]   I guess we could put up,
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.800]   we'll push Windows weekly back by half an hour.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.040]   Floss weekly might have to move forward or something.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.920]   We'll figure that out.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.040]   Our show today brought to you
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.280]   by our good friends at,
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.200]   I know they're good friends
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.440]   because they are sponsors,
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.800]   and all our sponsors are our dear friends.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.080]   Zoktok, oh, I like, I do like Zoktok.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.720]   Now is the time, right?
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.880]   Before you book any brunch, what do you do?
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.480]   You go, you look at reviews, you go to Yelp,
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.920]   you pour over lists, what's the best place?
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.960]   Why don't you do the same thing
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.880]   when you're booking a doctor?
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.720]   Arguably, a doctor is more important than brunch.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.080]   Is that even a case of contention?
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.080]   I don't think so.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:06.560]   Well, with Zoktok, you can pick a doctor
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.800]   based on real verified patient reviews.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.200]   You can find the doctor who's in your network,
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.120]   so the insurance covers it, and in your neighborhood,
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.240]   so you don't have to bore a tunnel.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.480]   Finding the right doctor is at least as important
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.120]   as finding the right plate of bed spinnadict.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.760]   I think you would agree.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.280]   Zoktok is free, by the way, free app,
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.280]   shows you doctors who are patient reviewed,
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:33.000]   take your insurance and are available when you need them.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.720]   It's nothing worse than finding a doctor.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.680]   You know, my buddy says, oh, you should try this guy,
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.520]   and you call him and say,
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.960]   you're not taking new patients right now, come on.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.680]   On Zoktok, you can find every specialist in this sun,
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.960]   and they are taking patients.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.480]   Whether you're trying to straighten those teeth,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.880]   fix an eight-gibak, get that mold checked,
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.680]   or anything else, Zoktok, ZOC, DOC, DOC, has you covered.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.680]   They've got a great mobile app, very easy to use.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.320]   Search, find and book doctors.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.120]   It'll just take a few taps.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.480]   And it's really important.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.040]   I think, you know, look, we look,
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.960]   I don't buy anything without looking at the Amazon reviews.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.160]   I think you need verified patient reviews
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.360]   before you trust a doctor.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.560]   From real people who made real appointments,
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.480]   so that when you walk into that doctor's office,
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.000]   you're said to see someone in your network
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.760]   who's gonna be the doctor you want.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.440]   Go to ZOCtok.com, find the doctor that's right for you.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.760]   Book an appointment in person or remotely, yes, of course.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.480]   They can do remote appointments
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.680]   that works for your schedule.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   Every month, now millions of people use ZOCtok every month.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.240]   They're there whenever you need to find and book a quality doctor.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.280]   Go to ZOCtok.com/Macbreak.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.880]   Please do that, by the way, so they know you saw it here.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.000]   You can get the app right there for free

[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.560]   Thank you, ZOCtok, ZOCtok.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.360]   So we know, or we think we know that Apple will not ship,
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.360]   iPad, OS 16, until the iPad comes out.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.760]   iOS 16 seems pretty well baked.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.600]   You're using, which beta are you using, Jason Six?
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.160]   - Oh, wow, who counts anymore?
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.080]   Yeah, I think that's what it is.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.120]   Yeah, it seems pretty well done.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.160]   You know, Google did a funny thing.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.480]   After their sixth beta of Android 13,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.320]   they just pushed it out last week.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.400]   Oh, everybody's got it.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.880]   It was like, what?
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.240]   You're not gonna wait for the phone, what?
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.720]   But that isn't as big an update, I think.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.280]   And one of the challenging updates in the new iOS,
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.120]   and I think one of the reasons iPad OS
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.280]   is gonna be delayed in another month is stage manager.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   Apple's, this is again, Mark Gurman.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.960]   He's pretty much dominated the show so far.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.080]   I'll find somebody else.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.360]   Apple's new iPad multitasking system doesn't cut it.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.760]   And I have to say, I've been using the public beta
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.160]   of iPad OS 16.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.480]   And yeah, I'm close to turning it off.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.560]   Have you, are you leaving it on?
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.880]   - I, I mean, the beauty is you toggle it on and off,
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.640]   so you use it when it makes sense and when it's not.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.480]   I'm using it, you know, it's getting better.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.120]   It is a huge leap for them.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.200]   I think it's really smart for them to put it off for a month
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.120]   because-
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   - But is a month enough to make it better?
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.480]   - My understanding is that they are working, you know,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.880]   very hard on stomping out a lot of bugs,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.680]   and that every beta, you know,
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.640]   every beta is better and changing things.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.000]   And they're trying to change things and fix things
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   as they go, and that's hard, but they're not like,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.400]   confident that they got it right and it's all fine, right?
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.520]   Like, I think that there's a lot of hard work going in
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.800]   and holding it for 16.1 basically
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.840]   before they do their releases.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.200]   Probably a good idea, but I don't agree with Mark.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.720]   I think that there's work to be done there,
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.120]   but I think Mark is, he's, you know, I don't know,
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.640]   he doesn't like it and that's-
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.880]   - I don't either, I'm with him.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.600]   He says stage manager is convoluted and confusing.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   It's not about the bugs, it's about the design,
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.520]   it's about how it works.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.320]   You get the sense he writes that Apple's driving to do
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.280]   something new and different, a multitasking solution
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.720]   that was nothing like what exists in the Mac today.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   He gives him kudos for trying, but he says it's kind of janky
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.560]   and I kind of agree.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.800]   Andy, have you used it yet?
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.520]   - I've used it, I don't have it installed
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.520]   on my primary devices 'cause I only have one Mac,
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.920]   that only you have one Mac and one iPad
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.320]   that can do both of those things.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.040]   So I've had to sort of like depend on the kindness
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.880]   of strangers.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.880]   I think I thought it was intriguing.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.800]   I'm not in the position yet to judge it
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.880]   'cause it's still in beta.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.840]   I agree with Jason, I'm very, very happy
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.160]   that they decided to delay it rather than give us
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.800]   either a half of experience or a full experience
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.360]   that is not fully baked yet.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.120]   I think they did the same thing with continuity, didn't they?
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.000]   Where they said, okay, we thought we'd have this ready
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.560]   for the major release, but it's gonna be,
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.760]   we're gonna have that as an update a few months later.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.040]   And as a result, I have a feature that I rely on
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.320]   every single day as opposed to something
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.680]   that I used a couple of times.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.720]   It let me down or it wasn't good enough
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.240]   and then I simply forgot about it.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.760]   So yeah, it's, and the other thing,
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.760]   I know that speaking as the person who declared the flat keyboard
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.080]   of the 2016 MacBook to be garbage
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.520]   that they should never put on there,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.000]   it's kind of, there are times when it's kind of okay
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.200]   to be divisive, it's okay to have,
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.000]   look, this is a big, big leap.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.560]   We think that this is a big important part
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.040]   of what the iPad has to be.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.600]   When we're charging potentially $1,500
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.720]   for people who want a professional level iPad,
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.920]   we feel as though the productivity end of this,
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.040]   being able to juggle between multiple tasks
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.720]   and multiple apps is not adequate
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.040]   to the potential of the hardware.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.280]   We have to make this big leap forward.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.480]   It's okay for them to say that we think,
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.680]   we really believe in this, we're not gonna force you
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.120]   to use it if you don't wanna use it.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.920]   Like Jason said, you can turn it off if you hate it,
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.760]   that's fine.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.560]   And then maybe after two more iterations
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.160]   in a couple of years, you'll turn it back on again
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.640]   and you'll find that they fixed everything
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   you didn't like about it.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   So all I'm hoping for is that so long as they get
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.000]   the core verbs and nouns of this feature correct.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.400]   If it feels like that makes sense
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.760]   that this is where we would be parking
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.480]   active windows and active tasks
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.000]   that are still in process,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.960]   the simple motion of here's how I'm going to switch
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.440]   between one view and another view.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.680]   If they get that right, they can build up on it
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.280]   and that's what I'm hoping that they're doing
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.240]   and that's why I'm never, what is the,
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.320]   what was the famous game developers quote
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.240]   that a bad game is always bad.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.720]   A late game stops being late as soon as you release it.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.160]   So you may as well make it late and good.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.400]   - Very few developers follow that mantra.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.240]   - Yes.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.080]   (laughing)
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:03.920]   - Yeah.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.760]   - Have you used it all like so?
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.840]   - Late good and fired.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.280]   - No, I'm not, I don't have anything to bait.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.800]   I just don't have time to bait anything right now.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.960]   I need to all work.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.360]   And the, but I will say that I'm kind of like
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.840]   meh, about the idea.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.560]   Like so it's not like I feel like I'm dying to upgrade
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.720]   so that I can get this to work.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.560]   I mean, I'm kind of in the world of my iPad works.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.400]   - Great.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.560]   - I was barely happy with the idea that they'd make
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.040]   the iPad be more power.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.400]   You know, you've got all this power out of the hood,
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.520]   make it more, not more like a desktop,
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.640]   but more usable as your only computer.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   But I have always on both Mac and iPad used workspaces,
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.120]   it full screen and workspaces.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.880]   And I'm very comfortable with switching that way
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.320]   on the Mac even, you know,
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.920]   as swiping it to the next one and the next one.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.120]   And that works very well for me.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.280]   So maybe I'm just not the,
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.120]   - Yeah, I mean, you're not the target audience
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.600]   because the iPad, I thought OS is basically
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.920]   a full screen splits, screen kind of view.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.720]   And what they're trying to do is say,
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.320]   what if you don't want that in a certain circumstance?
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.160]   - Right.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.600]   - And my issue with Mark German's take on this
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.120]   is that he seems to basically say, nope next.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.640]   And it's, and as Andy said, it's new.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.800]   They're trying to do windowing on the iPad.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.200]   There's no legacy of windowing on the iPad.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.320]   Like Sage Manager on the Mac, you can use it or not,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.440]   but like it kind of makes sense
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.320]   because it gets all of the windowing features
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.240]   that the Mac has had for decades.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.960]   Whereas the iPad, they're also figuring that part out.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.240]   I, you know, I am using it right now,
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.320]   using universal control attached to my Mac.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.200]   When you're on a trackpad and a keyboard,
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.280]   it makes a lot of sense.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.600]   If you put it in that case,
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.480]   if you attach it to an external monitor,
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.960]   there are lots of things they have to work on.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.640]   The beauty of it is it's a mode.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.960]   You can shut it off if you don't want to be in that mode.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.400]   I toggle between those modes
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.280]   because there are lots of apps on my iPad
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   that I would much rather,
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.640]   I spend huge amounts of time on my iPad.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.960]   And often I want to be in full screen mode,
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.920]   but every now and then I want to have a Twitter window open
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.480]   and a chat window open at the same time.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.480]   And you can do that now in a way that is, it's new
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.560]   and it's different and it's an additive thing, right?
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.400]   What they're not doing is saying forget the iPad.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.520]   We're throwing that away.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.360]   And stage manager is the future.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.640]   That's not what they're saying.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.000]   We're going to add another mode for people
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   who want that mode some or all the time.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.200]   And I think that it's got a lot of potential.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.360]   I'm not saying it's all there,
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.760]   but I think it would be foolish to throw it away
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.160]   when they have, they're taking a big swing
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.360]   and it is step one.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.080]   And then presumably they will not abandon it
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.440]   and will actually iterate on it the next couple of years.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.320]   And I think sometimes with band and stuff.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.000]   And I think they took the chances with it
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.600]   where they took chances with spaces.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.320]   They created spaces where you could jump from one monitor
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.640]   to another and after 10 years I still hate it.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.480]   (laughs)
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.560]   So I looked at this like,
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.920]   I wonder if this will be as good as spaces,
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.840]   which I just like, I hate it.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.320]   But yeah, but again, I like the fact that it would be
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.280]   so easy for some of them to simply say,
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.320]   oh, so obviously we're going to do overlapping windows.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.160]   Boom, done.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.880]   So let it in turn do it on his long weekend and we got it.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.240]   That doesn't make sense for a device
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.560]   that is so comprehensively multi-touch as an iPad.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.720]   I've always said that I thought that Microsoft
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.560]   did a really good job of crafting a new iteration of windows
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.880]   that makes sense when you have a desktop
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.440]   and you're just interacting via a mouse and a keyboard.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.560]   And it also makes sense when you have a tablet or a convertible.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.840]   But that's for the iPad to simply say,
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.880]   we are going to introduce a conjecture
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.360]   that is 20, 30 years old at this point.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:45.000]   As if it is as relevant today as it was on the Xerox Alto
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.160]   in the late 70s.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.240]   I'm glad that they are really trying to think something forward.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.720]   So again, I'm willing to wait for them to get this.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.800]   If they started off say, look, we like this idea.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.480]   We like this mechanism for now on,
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.720]   for the first iteration, it's going to be a really good app
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.600]   slash task switcher and we're going to be continuing
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.400]   to develop it over the next few years.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.600]   Well, by the way, I was informed by a helpful person
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.680]   on the line that it's Shigaru Miyamoto who had that line,
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.560]   the famous famous famous like a foundational Nintendo game
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.200]   developer who had that line of better,
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.640]   essentially better to be late and good than on time
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.320]   and always sucking.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:30.000]   Yeah, I think he actually did it unlike most.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   I feel like the stage manager controls
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.160]   take up way too much space, especially in the iPad
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.840]   where space is at premium.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.880]   And it feels to me very much like,
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.960]   Apple's tried technologies in the past before
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.520]   to make it easier to multitask.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.000]   What's that thing where you press F5 and the idea?
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.680]   Mission control.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.200]   Mission control.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.920]   Does anybody, I mean, I'm sure there's a handful of people
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.840]   that will think, oh my god, that's the best feature ever.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.160]   I use that all the time to show the desktop.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.280]   You spread your fingers out and it shows you the desktop
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.920]   or you do a swipe up and shows you all your windows
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.080]   so you can find the one you want,
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.760]   even if it's hidden behind other things.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.040]   This is the thing about all of these kinds of features, right?
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.000]   Is that no user interface nicety for window management
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.680]   or for multitasking is going to be used
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.960]   by a hundred percent of the population.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.960]   Everything is a little nation unto itself.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.480]   It's 20% using this feature.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.920]   And like, I would not be caught dead using full screen
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.320]   on the Mac, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.720]   But other people love it.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.360]   And I don't use spaces 'cause I don't like spaces,
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.640]   but I use those Mission Control gestures, right?
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.240]   And other people, Leo, are like, why would you ever do that?
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.920]   And what Apple is doing here, that's why I say,
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.960]   you know, stage manager is additive, right?
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.600]   It's like, I think Apple realizes
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.280]   we're not getting everybody with this.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.840]   Let's try something else on the Mac.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.840]   And also this is gonna be our take on this for the iPad,
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.640]   but remember, they're still letting you not use that mode
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.120]   if you want, you can do split view or full screen
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.360]   and it works the same way as it always has.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.080]   So I think that's the challenges is you can't view this
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.040]   as being Apple has said, forget how you use the iPad.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.120]   This is how you use it now.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.920]   They're trying to add another mode.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.400]   I think they're showing progress.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.960]   I think it's way more usable than it was in beta one.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.560]   And we'll see where it goes, but it's not for everybody
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.400]   and it's not gonna be.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.360]   I think it's best, the best place for this thing
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.640]   is on an external display.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.200]   And how many people are gonna use
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.800]   an external display with an iPad?
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.680]   And second best is in one of those keyboard
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.120]   and trackpad cases that they make.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.360]   And how many people use that?
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.960]   It is a tiny fraction.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.800]   I do, but most people don't.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.640]   - And you use it on your Mac?
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.120]   - You use your touch?
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.120]   Jerry's still out on that.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.440]   I get what they're going for.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:40.120]   I am fighting against decades of Mac history on that front.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.120]   - You don't even need it on your Mac, right?
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.440]   - Well, I mean, I have a 27 inch monitor.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.360]   So it's not as much, but like on my MacBook Air,
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.640]   I'm interested in the idea of having separate sets
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.600]   that you can switch between,
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.280]   but they're never out of sight and out of mind.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.760]   I think that there's some possibilities there,
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:55.800]   but I mean, we'll see.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.280]   I guess my point is just it's not for everyone.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.840]   It's not meant to be for everyone.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.400]   And if it adds another little part of it,
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.720]   like all of these features that they keep adding
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.320]   are not for everybody.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.440]   And maybe that's a failing of theirs,
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.680]   but maybe that's just the reality
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.480]   that we all use our computers in different ways.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.840]   - I feel like this is just another mission control expose.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.480]   They'll probably leave it in there.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.840]   Some people, there's a number of people in our chats
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.800]   who love it along with Jason, we'll use it.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.280]   But I don't think it's the revolution in UI
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.320]   that I kind of was interested in.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.520]   And they were pitching it as I just don't think so.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.080]   I think it's gonna be a--
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.440]   - But I think Jason sort of side mentioned
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.560]   an interesting point that it's true that,
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:40.120]   it's very, very useful for people who have an external monitor
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.320]   on external display on an iPad,
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.320]   but hey, how many people will actually use that?
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.080]   I think this is a way of saying that maybe it's time
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.200]   that you should have a desk that has a display
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.440]   and a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse on it
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.280]   and a little tablet stand for your iPad
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.480]   that once you realize that, gee,
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.320]   maybe I don't have to buy a $2,000, $1,500 laptop.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.840]   Someone who wasn't going to buy that $2,000,
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.400]   $1,500 laptop anyway, but it will get them to be so in love
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.280]   with how much productivity they can get done
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.760]   with their $800 iPad that it adds value
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:16.560]   and it means it's in addition to buying a new iPhone
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.320]   every two or three years and handing down the previous one
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.560]   to another person in the family,
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.040]   now that maybe that will bring iPads into that cycle as well.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.840]   And certainly I understand it's a choice
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.800]   that you don't have to make.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.960]   It doesn't change anything.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.720]   But Apple is devoting a lot of expertise,
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   brain power, time, promoting to this
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.560]   that they could have done something else with.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.160]   You know, so--
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.880]   - Well, you don't have to choose what features
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.480]   you're gonna spend time on and I'm not convinced
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.800]   this is the one.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.440]   - Yeah, and what I will say though,
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.480]   is you don't wanna put out features
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.640]   and not promote them 'cause I know in every system.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.360]   So if you're gonna, the one thing Apple is pretty good at
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.200]   is not killing tons of things and so they tend to put
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.080]   something out and put a lot of weight behind it
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.960]   because they're gonna keep it for a while.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.800]   - Yeah.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.840]   - And so I think it makes sense for them to push hard.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.360]   - Well, how long they get butchered.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.720]   - And I'm not sold but we'll see.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.000]   - I mean, right?
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:10.840]   - Exactly.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.760]   - I believe it.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.440]   And Apple has a long and as does any tech company,
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:16.920]   history of introducing stuff nobody was interested in
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   and it just kind of dribble along.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:24.480]   The question really is only is stage manager that
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.880]   or is it a revolution in the way people use iPads?
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.560]   - I'd just have to be right now.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.120]   - So long as it adds value, it'll justify the expense.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.800]   - Yeah, I mean, there is a little portion
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.240]   of the iPad user base that is the people who want pro
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.080]   features from the iPad and I'm one of them
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.760]   and we have been complaining for a long time
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.760]   about this not being there.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.440]   This is for us and it's not for everybody
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.400]   but it's like part of me wants to say,
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.360]   "Hey Leo, my turn."
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.280]   Like I don't want this.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.280]   - No, no, no, I'm not.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.480]   - It's my time.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.120]   - I want to use it in a pro way too
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.240]   and I am using it as you are as a second monitor on my Mac.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.520]   I wish it were a little, it's still a little sticky
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.480]   to get the mouse over there and use it
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.120]   but it's nice to be able to do that.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.720]   I think that's a great use.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.040]   And look, it's an M1.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.080]   I got a two terabyte M version.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.600]   I was thinking this is going to be a pro device.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.480]   - Let's see when they ship.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.000]   So they're not going to ship it to October.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.360]   Let's see where it is there, right?
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.400]   And see if you feel differently about it
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.720]   in a context where you're using it
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.840]   with an external pointing device.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.280]   How are they doing?
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.640]   And I believe that Apple thinks
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.240]   that this is a long game kind of thing
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.200]   and they're going to keep iterating on this.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.320]   They better be because if they ship what they've got
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.720]   with a few beta fixes and then abandon it,
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.480]   we all should complain about that
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:47.520]   because it's a start and a start means you keep going.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.040]   Apple abandoned so much of their technology
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.680]   after one iteration and doesn't look at it again
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.560]   for three years and stage manager needs work
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.560]   because iPad still doesn't really,
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.520]   like click on a link to spawn a Safari window
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.520]   in stage manager, right?
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.400]   Like where does it open?
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.240]   Nobody knows.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.560]   Like it's just not logical yet.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.760]   They have to figure this stuff out.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.640]   - It's also ugly.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.920]   It's just the ugly blobs on the left of my window.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:15.760]   I don't get it.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.600]   It's just ugly.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.440]   But that's--
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.280]   - Yeah, I want, yeah.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.640]   You can move windows over there and hide it
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.480]   and that's what I do.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.840]   It's like I don't want to see it.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.080]   I don't want to see it just leave over there.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.240]   - I didn't know I could do that.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.120]   Okay, that's good to know.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.880]   So then I don't have so many complaints
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:28.880]   about it taking up so much space.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.320]   - Yeah, and then you can swipe.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.960]   And then if you move your cursor all the way over
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.160]   to the left, it'll do a little reveal.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.080]   - Oh, okay.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.360]   - And that's a much better interface.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.880]   It should probably be the default.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.040]   'Cause I don't want to use,
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.520]   especially on a small iPad display,
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.360]   you don't want to waste screen real estate
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.480]   on your little--
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.000]   - That's a big gutter.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.640]   - Not to mention the fact that there's a dock
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.400]   at the bottom and now there's this other dock
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.520]   at the side which is a real mixed metaphor.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.720]   Like how many different,
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.400]   can we put ones at the top and the bottom two
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.280]   and just work in a little postage stamp in the middle?
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.920]   Like it's too many things.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.240]   So having an auto show and auto hide is actually,
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.040]   I think there's a keyboard command to do it.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.080]   Another is on the Mac.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.360]   I don't know if there is on the iPad.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.480]   - Okay, I'll have to take a look at that.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.800]   So maybe I'm just holding it wrong.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.280]   That's possible.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.120]   - It could happen.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.040]   It happened.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.880]   - There is a big update, which of course we should have led
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.000]   with but by now everybody watches this show
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.360]   has already done it for iPad, iPad OS and Mac OS 15.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.040]   0.6.1.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.840]   It is very important.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.400]   It solves an issue in WebKit too,
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.080]   the vulnerabilities in WebKit,
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:35.240]   that were zero days actively being exploited.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   Apple said the WebKit bug could be exploited
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.960]   if a vulnerable device accessed or processed
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.320]   maliciously crafted Web content.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:48.120]   So like do you go to any websites on your machine?
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.800]   Oh, you're vulnerable.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.400]   And by the way, it doesn't have to be a hacker website.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.440]   It could be a website that's been compromised, right?
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.760]   Could lead to the three worst words
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.760]   in the computing industry, arbitrary code execution.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.240]   Second bug allows a malicious application
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.320]   to administer this application
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.040]   to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.040]   So the two flaws are believed to be related
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.040]   and you could see how you could chain one to the other.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.040]   So you go to a bad website,
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.840]   they then put an app on your system,
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.560]   which then gives them kernel privileges
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:25.800]   and you're in bad shape.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:30.240]   Nation States spyware ring a bell.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:34.880]   That's who so far has used this.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.600]   So Apple rushed to put out the fix
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.280]   and you should rush to install it.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.120]   - Yeah.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.440]   Anytime Apple comes up with updates
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:49.200]   to literally everything that has a clock chip inside it.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.760]   - Oh dear, that was a bad weekend
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.960]   for a lot of people in Cupertino
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.320]   and a bad weekend for anybody who hasn't patched that yet.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.200]   So yeah, don't be the one person
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.320]   who keeps dismissing the prompt
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.520]   like day after day after day for three weeks
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.120]   is like, yeah, maybe I will take a half hour break
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:04.960]   to update the iPad.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.040]   - Even the iPad Touch is vulnerable.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:07.880]   - Yes.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.600]   - Six S and later on the phone iPad Air 2 and later,
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.560]   fifth generation iPad and later iPad Mini 4 and later,
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.280]   iPad Touch seventh generation
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.240]   and all iPad Pro models are affected.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.560]   And of course, Monterey.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.080]   So your Mac should also get updated.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.320]   Tell your friends, tell your friends
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.200]   who don't listen to this show.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.080]   First of all, they should be listening.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.600]   Second of all, they should do that patch.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.040]   I don't know if this is gonna conflict actually
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.640]   with September 7th.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:43.480]   Tim Cook will be speaking at the Code Conference,
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.960]   which is six, seven and eight of next month.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.600]   Maybe Tim will be there on the eighth also
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.520]   and this will be very interesting.
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.400]   Johnny Ive and Lorraine Powell jobs.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.360]   So they're gonna have to, I don't know.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.080]   Boy, it'd be interesting if they're all three on stage.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.880]   I doubt that's the case.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.520]   Cara Swisher, of course, will be running the interrogation.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.640]   I could see, actually, I could totally see Tim Cook going
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.640]   the day after the Apple event, right?
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.920]   - Right. - To promote it.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:17.960]   Sundar Pichai from Alphabet, Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon,
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:22.760]   Evan Spiegel, this apparently is the place to go.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.520]   Mark Cuban, Gavin Newsom, the governor,
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.320]   Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg,
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.320]   and the Verge's editor-in-chief, Niele Patel,
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.280]   'cause the Verge puts it, Vox puts it on there,
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.600]   their parent company.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.200]   Casey Annute, and also be speaking, which is cool.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.520]   - It's important to have events like these,
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.960]   'cause it's one of the rare events
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.960]   where the presence of this CEO is not
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.720]   the reason why this event exists,
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.960]   where it's not like they are so,
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.440]   it's so important for this conference
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.880]   that this one person come and give a keynote
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:58.560]   that they're not gonna be challenged,
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.360]   they're not gonna be put in any sort
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.800]   of an awkward situation.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.080]   Obviously, it's not as though they're gonna be bringing up
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.680]   like embarrassing high school yearbook pictures of anybody,
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.480]   but it is a place where, one of the rare places
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.280]   where maybe Tim Cook is going to be asked about,
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.040]   look, what happens with Taiwan?
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.400]   Like, what, are you close to,
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.160]   do you have an exit plan for,
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.800]   what do you do if absolutely some even impossible
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.520]   to do business with China anymore?
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:26.200]   And he can't just simply give like the pad answer
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.800]   and then move on to, but the haptic touch
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.240]   on the brand new Mac Pro is, you know,
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.760]   you guys are scaring me.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.160]   China's not gonna invade Taiwan.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:43.400]   Well, it's a problem if China does it
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.480]   in the next five years.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.160]   Like that's the problem.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.000]   But so--
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:47.840]   It's nuclear.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.680]   Are they gonna do it more?
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:49.520]   Are they gonna do it in the next six months?
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.760]   Maybe not, but you know, China only has,
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.320]   at this point, China has a limited amount of time
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.160]   to do what they're doing.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.360]   They're running out of oxygen,
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.080]   you know, from a population perspective.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.120]   Taiwan can't solve that.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.560]   No, it's not, but they, if they wanna make the move,
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.320]   they won't have, they need to make it sooner than later.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.040]   That's what a lot of folks think anyway.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   So that they, you know, that they can't wait for them.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.680]   Well, the party congress is October.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.600]   She is doing stuff to apparently burnish
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.080]   his reputation ahead of the party congress.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.920]   I seems like that would be a suicide mission.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.160]   I mean, flying over to the problem is that flying jets
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.160]   or flying shooting missiles over top of Taiwan
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.360]   basically started the sand, right?
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.720]   Like, I mean, everybody's now trying to figure out
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.320]   how they diversify from China, you know?
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.680]   And it's, you know, it's just seen,
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.760]   and what of course made this way worse is that
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.640]   everything was theoretical until Ukraine.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.560]   So, so the thing, so what's on how do you think that
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:46.560]   the less theory it was.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.200]   - So you think that China took from Russia
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.000]   invading Ukraine was, oh, we can get away with this?
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.280]   - No, no, but I think that the thing is, is that they,
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.840]   you know, when we send people over
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.120]   and then they start firing missiles over top of the island,
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.920]   you know, it has everyone go, well,
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.160]   this would be a trillion dollar problem right now.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.760]   - Huge problem for all of tech.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.640]   - But tech is now, I mean, anybody who is anyone
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:09.360]   is trying to figure out how to not be in China.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.400]   Like, that is the big, like, now it's all like,
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.840]   how do we get all of our stuff?
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.000]   Or how do we get to a point where we can do
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.880]   some of our work?
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:19.040]   Like, Apple is doing better because Apple is
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.320]   diversifying away from hardware.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.760]   So if something happened, they could delay things
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.160]   or put things off or whatever, they can't stop.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.880]   But they, you know, could, they'd still have revenue, right?
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.320]   But there's a lot of companies that don't.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.320]   And we've already seen what happens in the supply chain
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.000]   when China slows down.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.600]   And so, but everyone's trying to go from that.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.440]   - Yeah, to me, that was the real warning, right?
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.520]   Like, oh, that's what happens when they should have been,
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.360]   Shanghai, you can't make Mac books anymore.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.120]   - But what happens when it's politically impossible
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.240]   to do work there?
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.880]   Like if they go into Taiwan, I mean, consumers
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.120]   are gonna be pretty upset if you can leave
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.560]   your factories open in China.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.080]   And you can try to explain it away and say, well,
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.920]   it's not gonna happen.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:57.760]   - Oh, no, it's not gonna happen.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.200]   - You can do, you're using monthly issue sanctions.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.120]   - Yeah, so-- - And none of that stuff
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.760]   will be allowed into the US.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.600]   So that's gonna cause a huge-- - And so that's it.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:06.000]   It shuts that off like a water tap.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.880]   - And so the thing is, is these companies are, you know,
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.520]   now they're trying to get all these, you know,
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:10.360]   it'll speak to them. - Well, I'm complaining
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.200]   doing that. - It's not.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.400]   - They should have done that years ago, frankly.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.240]   - Absolutely, they should have, no, never gone in.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:20.240]   So the issue right now though is that you couldn't
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.040]   respond right now.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.520]   My guess is because it's happened slowly,
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.520]   a decade from now, it won't matter what China does
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:31.120]   because the companies are all gonna be gone.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.680]   Like they'll still be there, but they're gonna have ways
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:37.180]   to do this without them, and that wasn't technically
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:40.140]   a great move by China to broadcast so far.
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:43.920]   - I have a bit of real-time follow-up, by the way.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.400]   Karis Wisher actually tweeted, 'cause this is her last
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.080]   code conference. - Her last one.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.840]   - They are doing a session with Tim Cook, Johnnie Ivey,
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.080]   and Lorraine Powell Jobs to talk about the impact
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.760]   of Steve Jobs. - The three of them.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.840]   - That is the session.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.800]   The three of them. - Oh, that will be awesome.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.200]   - His lasting impact for Karis last,
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.360]   'cause famously Steve Jobs went many times.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.960]   I was there in the audience for a few of those,
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.520]   like many times with Bill Gates by himself
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.640]   to do the code conference with Walt and Karis.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.560]   So Karis, sort of for her valedictory,
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.560]   she is gonna bring them back to talk about Steve.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.880]   That will be something to see.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.080]   - Boy, that just shows you the power of Karis Wisher.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.920]   Holy cow.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.760]   Wow. - Yeah.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.560]   - And she's retiring after this year.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.640]   She says, "Future resident of Hawaii."
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.280]   So that will be something to see.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.600]   Johnnie, Tim, and Lorraine talking about Steve.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.080]   - Yeah, sorry to interrupt, but that was--
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.440]   - No, thank you. - That was the clarification
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.960]   we needed about what was going on.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.160]   - And I have to think that if Apple's event
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.040]   of September 7th, this event will be September 8th.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.200]   I would presume, I don't know.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.320]   Get on, you know what?
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.080]   I'd rather be at the Beverly Hilton for that
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.280]   than the Apple campus. - And if it's pre-taped,
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.160]   it doesn't really matter.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.200]   They don't even necessarily need Tim there,
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.280]   or Tim could be there--
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.840]   - It could be that afternoon, right after once.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.800]   - And then fly up, or he could fly down,
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.440]   and it's not a big deal if all he's doing
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.320]   is saying hello to the crowd, or even not present.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.080]   He said hello to the crowd at WWDC,
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.560]   but that was mostly for the developers.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.920]   Tim doesn't even need to be there
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.160]   if they just usher us in to watch a video,
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.080]   and then go, you're right, Tim doesn't need to be there for that.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.640]   So I wouldn't worry about it if I went him.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.760]   - Amazing.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.160]   That'll be fascinating.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.440]   Okay, thank you for updating.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.240]   - You've probably all seen the story.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   We'll talk about it in just a second.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.520]   Is it worth using a VPN on iOS?
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.800]   (laughing)
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.280]   - Maybe not.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.200]   - But first a word from eight sleep.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:48.200]   - Love, we love, love, love our eight sleep pod pro cover.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.640]   Oh, it's so good, it's so good.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.000]   Good sleep is a nature's gentle nurse,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.080]   the ultimate game changer,
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:02.520]   and the eight sleep pod is the ultimate sleep machine.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.480]   Consistent sleep, good sleep can reduce
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.120]   the likelihood of serious health issues,
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.240]   including risk for heart disease.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.360]   It could lower your blood pressure,
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.920]   it could reduce the risk of Alzheimer's,
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.240]   and this is an epidemic.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.960]   This is an epidemic of poor sleep,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.600]   more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.520]   One of the main causes, especially right now,
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.200]   when it's hot out, hot night,
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.600]   keeping you sweating in bed.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.920]   We never have that problem at home
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.040]   because we use our eight sleep pod.
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.040]   It is amazing.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.720]   It is not just something that can heat you up,
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.480]   it's something that can cool you down.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.760]   The pod cover, which we've added to our mattress,
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.600]   'cause we lower our mattress,
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.600]   they still have mattresses as well, you could choose.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.760]   We added the pod cover to our mattress,
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.160]   and it can go as low as 55 degrees,
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.000]   or as hot as 110 degrees.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.200]   You program it.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.400]   Most people, and this is certainly what I do,
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.960]   like it warm when I get in bed,
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.560]   and slip my feet under the covers,
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:02.840]   it's toasty, it's comfy,
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.760]   and then it cools off as I go to deeper and deeper sleep,
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.760]   and that's actually what your body wants.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.840]   So you really increase the quality
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.320]   and the time spent in that deep sleep,
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.400]   and then I have it go up a little bit
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.480]   in the morning to wake me up.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.720]   There's even a little vibration,
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.200]   so you can have a kind of silent alarm if you want
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.400]   to wake you up.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.120]   I just, I like having it just warm up,
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.800]   'cause I wake up naturally that way, and it's great.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.240]   Eight sleep is the only sleep technology
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.800]   that dynamically cools and heats each side of the bed,
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:36.120]   so Lisa has a wholly different plan than I do,
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.320]   but it maintains the optimal sleep temperature
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.160]   for us both in it,
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.200]   but it doesn't just take our instructions,
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.000]   it also checks the temperature of the room,
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.480]   so it's really hot, it'll cool you down a little bit more.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.760]   If it's really cool, we have it at this for a year,
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.360]   so we added it through last winter.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:54.160]   It was awesome to be warm in the winter, cool in the summer.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.800]   According to clinical data, eight sleep users experience
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.720]   up to 19% increase in recovery,
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.520]   up to 32% improvement in sleep quality,
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.400]   up to 34% more deep sleep.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.600]   We got ours a long time ago,
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.960]   because Kevin Rose was singing its praises,
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.200]   and then Kevin and Amy Webb were on a trip together,
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.400]   Amy got hers, and she loves it,
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.920]   so I said, "Well, honey, we gotta get one of these,"
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.360]   and I have to say, I put it on myself, yes,
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.440]   you probably heard me talk about how I put it on upside down
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.320]   at first, 'cause I didn't watch the video dummy,
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.280]   I'm one of those guys that goes,
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.520]   "I'm not gonna read the instructions,
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.080]   "I just hit snaps right on, it's easy."
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.640]   And then I realized I did it wrong,
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.920]   it's okay, put it back, put it in the right,
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.920]   started it up, it automatically adjusts,
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.680]   the sleep doctor will actually watch you,
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.840]   well, that's creepy, not watch you sleep,
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.560]   but it'll observe your sleep habits
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:47.920]   and adjust the temperature to get optimal sleep,
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.840]   and it really, really works,
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.200]   and I tell you, I feel so much better.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.840]   We have the pod two cover,
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.360]   they just put out the new pod three cover,
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.560]   which has even more accurate sleep and health tracking,
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.180]   double the amount of sensors,
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.600]   it is now the best sleep experience on earth,
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.080]   we're thinking of upgrading,
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.680]   'cause we are just all in.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.960]   We love our eight sleep pod.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.160]   It's not magic, but it sure feels like it.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.160]   Go to eightsleep.com/macbreak,
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.920]   start sleeping cool this summer,
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.600]   you'll be toasty warm this winter,
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.640]   you'll also save $150,
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.160]   a check out on the pod,
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.200]   eight sleep currently ships within the US, Canada,
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.440]   the UK and select countries in the EU and Australia,
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.640]   so they've really opened it up.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.720]   If you've been hearing me talk about this
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.000]   for the last eight months,
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.240]   now you can get it,

[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.400]   wouldn't you like a better night's sleep,
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.040]   who wouldn't, and this one really works,
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.440]   this is technology at play,
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.400]   they do a great job.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.080]   eightsleep.com/macbreak,
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.600]   thank you eightsleep for supporting Macbreak weekly,
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.120]   you support us by using that address,
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.200]   so they go, "Hey, these guys on Macbreak,
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.560]   they really work,"
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.640]   and then they will continue to support the show,
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.560]   so play is on big of you.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.320]   Ours Technica, Kevin Purdy,
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:11.320]   iOS VPNs have leaked traffic for years.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.400]   Now, what is the problem?
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.280]   Well, when you turn on a VPN on a device,
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.880]   normally all the connections to the outside world
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:25.440]   would be shut down and then reopened under the VPN,
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.800]   so that all the traffic out of the phone
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.960]   was protected by the VPN.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.840]   A security researcher says that Apple's iOS devices
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.520]   don't do this,
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   Michael Horowitz says that the problem is that sessions
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.600]   and connections established before the VPN
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.280]   is activated do not terminate,
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.040]   and they continue on sometimes for a long time.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.320]   Data leaves the iOS device outside the VPN tunnel,
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.560]   this is not a classic DNS leak,
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.040]   it's a data leak,
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.200]   he confirmed this using multiple types of VPN
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.760]   and software for multiple VPN providers,
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.520]   so it's not really an issue with the VPN
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.880]   you're using, it's the issue with the iPhone.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:13.120]   Proton had reported this earlier with iOS 13,
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.720]   ours added an update from proton founder and CEO Andy Ian,
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.440]   the fact is, quote, he said,
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.360]   the fact is this is still an issue,
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.880]   is disappointed to say the least,
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.160]   we first had notified Apple privately of this issue
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:28.280]   two years ago, Apple declined to fix it,
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.920]   that's why we disclosed the vulnerability
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.040]   to protect the public,
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.320]   millions of people's security is in Apple's hands,
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.280]   they are the only ones who can fix the issue.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:42.360]   So there is, I mean, there is a workaround apparently,
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.680]   which is to turn the VPN on,
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.840]   then to turn on airplane mode briefly,
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.680]   then turn it off again,
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.160]   by turning on the airplane mode,
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.200]   you'll force all the connections to disconnect,
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.280]   they'll reconnect under the VPN next time around.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:04.200]   That at least I've been told works, I haven't tested it.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.320]   So something that, this is from proton,
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.560]   they said it's almost effective,
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.800]   as effective as manually closing connections
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.800]   when you start a VPN, use that airplane mode.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:17.080]   But we cannot guarantee this 100%.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:21.200]   All right, so, what do you think?
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.440]   - It's it.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.960]   - Go ahead, Andy.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.480]   - That's just that it's creepy as hell,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:30.280]   because you expect to see that icon in the menu bar
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.760]   at, okay, I've got VPN going, that's great,
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.760]   I can trust that I'm not gonna think about this again.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.960]   The worst, I think part of what makes this so bad
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.160]   is that it is a very complicated problem,
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.840]   it's not as simple as, oh, well,
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.880]   it's it's it's indicating a VPN when VPN connection
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.080]   is tunnel has not been secured at all.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.920]   It is a set of circumstances where some of your data
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.600]   unbeknownst to you might be observable,
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.440]   and it just brings us all the way back to square one.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.840]   - Apple says they have fixed this in 2019,
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.840]   but Horowitz's research is current.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.520]   - Yeah, it's there's they added something to an API
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.680]   that blocks it apparently knocks out all of the connections
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.920]   when you do this and apparently that's been available to,
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.200]   but it's not on by default,
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.120]   but developers can turn it on.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:18.240]   I'm unclear whether that's what Horowitz is referring to
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.760]   when he says that even with that stuff leaks,
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.080]   that would be a bug, but I think the bigger question is
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:28.720]   why is that a default off feature of the API
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.400]   that you need to turn on and the larger issue is why
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.400]   this is going on.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.440]   I have a theory.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   My theory is that VPNs that completely leak
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.960]   or completely block all the current connections
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:48.960]   had some deleterious effects on Apple's own sync services
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.120]   on the iPhone and that they didn't like it.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.920]   And so they said, well, we'll let those ones continue
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.600]   until they're done and then they can go inside the VPN.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.120]   Something like that is my guess is that they did it
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.240]   and they're like, oh, oh, we can't have that.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.480]   That hurts the user experience in some way.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.760]   And the people on their security team
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.720]   did not walk up to them and say, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.960]   You don't understand VPNs and VPNs.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.920]   We can't, I know it's going to hurt,
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.880]   but they're the ones flipping the switch.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.360]   We've got to let them do it.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.560]   But I don't have an explanation for the fact
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.680]   that this is apparently a feature you can turn on,
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.240]   but that Horowitz still claims
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.880]   that it doesn't actually help.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.720]   - Even when it's turned on.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.560]   - It's not a mystery.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.400]   - So even when you turn it on, you're saying
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.240]   that it doesn't help or is it not?
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.920]   - It's unclear 'cause I don't know if I've seen him
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.760]   directly address that.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.360]   Apple has said there is this thing that you can turn on
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.920]   that basically is the do you want to cut
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.680]   all current connections when I establish a VPN
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.800]   that is supposed to solve this issue.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.440]   But the story I read, I think, suggested that a lot
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.120]   of VPN providers aren't using that feature.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.360]   So the issue is still out there.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.680]   - Nine if I, Mac has a couple of points on this.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.880]   One they say proton says it is only partially effective.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.160]   They made, they tried the claimed fix
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.720]   and they found it only partially effective.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.960]   Amplify says Apple's fix is unstable.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.920]   When a customer asked about it, they said
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.480]   during research and development, we try to enable this setting
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:20.800]   and it instantly caused VPN connection in stability.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.240]   Therefore we never released it to customers.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.800]   - And that's why it's off by the fault.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.720]   - And that's why it's off.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.600]   Like that's why it's not on and that's why
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.400]   they're putting it on because it's causing stability issues.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.400]   And a funny thing is that I actually found this to be really
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.880]   eye opening for me that you could just go to airplane mode
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.440]   because the way I was instructed to use VPNs
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.000]   was turn the phone off, turn it back on, turn the VPN on
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.320]   and then start using it.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.720]   Like that's why every time I've used VPN,
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.080]   that's how I've done it.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:48.920]   - That's certainly good.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.920]   - The idea that I can only have to do the airport.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.480]   - In that brief period between the time you turn the phone
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   back on and you turn on the VPN will remain in the clear.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.040]   That's the issue.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.880]   So the airplane mode, because you can have the VPN running.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.720]   - It's way better.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:04.680]   - It's also a lot faster.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:05.520]   - Yeah.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.280]   - It is just that I've been doing that for years.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.480]   - So yeah, so you've been away.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.320]   - Yeah.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.160]   - You've been smart.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.800]   - Yeah, I mean, well, I didn't know I just followed
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.280]   instructions that I was given.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.960]   Like I didn't know that there was a lot of--
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.880]   - And I should point out probably this isn't a big issue
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.080]   'cause people who use VPNs are not trying to hide
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.680]   from Apple in most cases and most of these services
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.920]   I suspect are Apple's background services.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.240]   They're trying to protect, you know, their email
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.720]   or protect their, you know, I mean, I would imagine
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.160]   certainly the airplane mode fix would be good enough
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:42.760]   for even if it doesn't affect all of Apple's services
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.600]   for most people.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.040]   I mean, why do you use a VPN?
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.200]   Is it to hide everything from Apple?
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.360]   Yeah, well, maybe not.
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.040]   I mean, after all, if you're logged in the Apple,
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.600]   it doesn't matter if you're using a VPN.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.520]   It's gonna go through the VPN tunnel and Apple say,
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.600]   oh, hi, there's your stuff, thank you.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.600]   - It's mostly new web pages and logins and that type of thing.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.920]   - And for you, I imagine, and for some,
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.040]   you're traveling in more hostile territories
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.440]   and that then becomes a concern 'cause you don't know,
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.160]   you know, what's being lived about you.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.440]   - I mean, it's automatically concerned because
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.720]   there's, you don't have VPN stuff.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.800]   You're used to the idea of, okay, if my VPN is on
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.000]   everything that's communicating off of my device
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.800]   across the internet is through a tunnel,
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.120]   you don't, there should never be an asteriskness to that.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.240]   Say, except for in these rare cases that we feel it's okay
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.360]   for something to exist, I would say the VPN
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.360]   as a, boom, boom, boom, hold up, what?
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.240]   And so if Apple feels as though they fix the bug,
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.040]   they're gonna have to at least explain if it's working,
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.160]   if VPN service on iOS is working exactly as Apple
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.280]   intends it to, now they need to come out with an explanation
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:52.080]   of what VPN is supposed to represent on an iPhone
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.560]   or on an iPad and basically make sure that everybody
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.960]   knows exactly how that stuff works or else it's just
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.800]   kind of sketchy.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.480]   - Well, you've been warned.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.400]   That's all I can say.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.120]   And we'll see, maybe this is something that iOS 16
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.880]   will address, I don't know.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.640]   Here's some good news.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.640]   If you do have an M2 MacBook Air, it runs Windows 11 faster
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:21.800]   than a Dell laptop under emulation.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:26.480]   So we've been talking about this on Windows weekly.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.640]   People are very impressed with how,
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.840]   you of course there's no more anyway to install Windows
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.800]   in bootcamp, bootcamp's gone.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   But parallel offers a version that will run on the Apple
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.360]   Silicon that will let you, you have to run Windows on ARM,
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.760]   which is a special version of Windows,
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.680]   designed for the ARM chip, Microsoft offers it,
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.760]   but apparently it's still in beta because it seems
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.760]   to be Microsoft has a deal with Qualcomm
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:57.160]   that it won't run officially on any non-qualcom chips.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:02.160]   So MaxTech, the YouTuber, actually did some testing
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:07.440]   and Geekbench 5 using Parallels 18 with Windows on ARM.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:13.280]   The laptop kind of clobbered the Dell XPS plus 1681
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:18.200]   on a single core test compared to 1182 for the Dell
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:22.320]   multi-core 7260 versus 5476.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.160]   That's like 25% faster.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.640]   Actually, one kid is almost 50% faster.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:33.880]   - Does it make you proud to be a Mac user when,
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:35.600]   even when you're, even when you're,
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.800]   when you're even with someone's doing something naughty,
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.920]   something that Apple did not plan for, did not intend,
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.840]   as like even, and this is not been optimized
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.760]   in any way, certainly, you're saying,
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.920]   oh, you know what, I'm suddenly, I'm 17 years old again,
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.680]   and say, oh IBM sucks, Mac rules forever.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.720]   Like, you know, I've grown up and I've become a less,
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.880]   less polarized man, but sometimes there's that little
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.400]   voice back in my head that just takes such satisfaction
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.400]   that yeah, an Apple Mac runs Windows much, much better than.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.280]   - When you plug in the Windows machine,
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.280]   it runs better, at least in one test.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.200]   And that makes sense because now the,
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.880]   the power envelope can go higher.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.000]   And so the Dell will run faster.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.960]   It also helps those of us who wanna,
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.080]   who really hate it when they say,
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.640]   "Well, I'm not buying a Mac, it's too expensive."
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.000]   Because the MacBook Air was 1600 bucks
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   while the slower XPS Plus was 1849.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.280]   So a nice test, Mac's tech, you're making us proud.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.520]   Well done.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.440]   - I like, I appreciate how Microsoft makes it so easy
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.880]   to get Windows on ARM using their early,
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.200]   really, for whatever it is program.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.640]   It's like, this could be difficult.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.520]   This could be like, "Oh, no, no, we gotta deal with Qualcomm.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:49.520]   "It's all pre-installed.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.360]   "You can't really get it.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.880]   "You gotta know somebody, you gotta lift."
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.000]   And they're like, "No, you just sign up and get it."
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.360]   - It's not nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.320]   - And back in Mac world, you know,
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.240]   almost 10 years ago probably, we did a cover
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.720]   that was the world's best PC.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.640]   It's a Mac.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.480]   - Yeah.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.840]   - And it's, I figured with the leaving intel behind
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.160]   that would no longer be the case.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.600]   It's nice to know, still true, still got it.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.680]   And it's unknown how, that's pure speculation
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.760]   that it was an exclusive deal with Qualcomm.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.600]   - Yeah.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.520]   - But it's unknown how long that deal
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.360]   will continue to run.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.640]   But hey, no problem, you just go to download Windows on ARM
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.440]   and you can download an official copy.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.280]   - It's amazing.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.160]   And all the Mac virtualization programs support it,
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.480]   too, of course.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.600]   And so everybody's just like, it's just wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.680]   And here we are, running Windows on ARM on the Mac.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.240]   - And one of the reasons it runs so well
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.360]   is it isn't really running an emulation, is it?
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.000]   It's an ARM Mac, the Apple Silicon's ARM chip.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.360]   - It's virtualization.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.200]   - Right.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.840]   - And then there is, right, Windows,
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.960]   Microsoft has some emulation in it.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.400]   That's actually an interesting point too,
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.000]   is that any emulation being done
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   is being done by Microsoft's emulation engine,
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.400]   which would make sense, right?
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.240]   - I think, yeah.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.640]   - Because they're the ones who control that.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.340]   So even on that, you would be getting the best,
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:08.160]   the best in class emulation of Intel processing,
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.400]   which is inside Windows.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.240]   - Yep.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.360]   - And how does it handle really graphics intensive processes,
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.920]   in that kind of emulation?
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.720]   - I think you should do a different thing now.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:18.720]   (laughing)
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.560]   - I don't know.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.400]   - I don't know.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.200]   - I mean, my understanding is that Windows on ARM
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.920]   is best used with stuff that's compiled for ARM,
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.800]   and I'm unclear what happens when you run into something
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.880]   that's made to be on Intel.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.800]   - It's one thing to be on ARM,
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.800]   but it's another thing to have the way that they Mac,
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.800]   the M1 and M2 manage GPUs and CPUs and how they work.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.720]   - Right.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.640]   It's not as explicit as it has been before,
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.320]   so it just seems like things that were,
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.360]   that one to lean heavily on the GPU might not know where to go.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.680]   - Apple.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.840]   - Go ahead.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.840]   - No, maybe they, maybe that's one of the things
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.640]   they've optimized a little bit, at least,
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.960]   is understanding how to, you know,
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.880]   parallels may have figured out a way to tie that,
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.320]   so it just makes the call as needed.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.720]   - I think in the long run, I'm very excited.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.320]   I really think that Apple Silicon's GPUs
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.120]   are gonna come along and,
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.680]   in hand in hand with metal,
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.080]   we're gonna see a very nice combination there.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.400]   We'll see, we'll see.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.880]   - Shao Long-Jong, a former Apple employee,
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:24.880]   has pled guilty to stealing trade secrets from Apple.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.600]   He was arrested at the Santa's A Airport in July 2018,
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.800]   planning to fly to China.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:34.120]   He had been working in Apple's project Titan.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.120]   He was accused of downloading Apple internal files,
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.440]   a 25-page document,
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.680]   including engineering schematics of a circuit board
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.400]   for an autonomous vehicle.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.880]   He also was accused of taking reference manuals and PDFs,
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.240]   describing Apple prototypes and prototype requirements,
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:54.240]   presumably, to bring them to China, Apple Caught 'em.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:59.440]   And he's facing as much as 10 years in prison,
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.920]   and a quarter of a million dollar fine
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:04.280]   after pleading guilty he'll be sentenced in November.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:09.680]   - Yeah, this has been promoted by the Biden administration
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.560]   and other government organizations as,
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.120]   this is one of the reasons why America considers China
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.120]   to be a huge threat,
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.520]   not necessarily the military threat,
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.040]   but the fact that they are really making a great effort
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.720]   to put people into research positions,
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.240]   put people into industrial positions
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.960]   to get as many secrets as possible,
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.680]   and bring them back to China.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.400]   And so this is why the CHPS Act has a section
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.480]   all about it about saying,
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.840]   look, if you're gonna be doing research
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.680]   under government grants,
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.920]   where you're gonna have to go through training
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.400]   on how to protect your research,
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.120]   if you're gonna be doing research for the government,
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.640]   you are not going to be taking a job
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.120]   or taking grant money from China,
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.680]   because it's just gonna wind up in the hands of people
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.840]   that maybe we may or may not want it to be in the hands of.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.640]   And industrial stuff, it's not their property,
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.880]   they shouldn't be able to do this,
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.480]   so it's absolutely no surprise.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.760]   - Apple first suspected Jiang of stealing trade secrets
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.680]   after he took paternity leave and went to China.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.360]   When he came back, he turned in his resignation,
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.840]   saying he wanted to move back home
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.160]   to take care of his mother.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.840]   He planned to work for ex-motors
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.360]   of leading Chinese electric vehicle company.
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.200]   At that point, they cut his access to the network,
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.200]   and of course, just went,
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.000]   'cause they have a lot,
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.520]   I'm sure, a lot of logging,
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.400]   and went back and looked at what he had downloaded
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:24.680]   and what he had access to.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.520]   One of the things that we've learned from this
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.560]   in the charging documents from back in 2018
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.840]   was that Apple had five,
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.800]   this is people in the project Titan,
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.440]   5,000 disclosed employees,
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.520]   which means they knew about the project,
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.040]   and 2,700 core employees
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.320]   with access to project materials and databases.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.480]   Doesn't mean they're all working on it,
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:49.040]   but I would guess the vast majority of those 2,700 people
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.280]   were working in project Titan four years ago in 2018.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.160]   - Yeah, and who knows what they were actually working on,
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.440]   and if the project didn't take a big, big square
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.560]   in any different direction since then,
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:02.080]   so maybe the stuff they got is valuable to a certain extent,
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.600]   but it's not necessarily valuable
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.240]   in terms of what Apple's developing now.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.760]   - It's not a unique case, another former Apple employee,
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.680]   G. Zhang Chen is also facing charges,
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.520]   allegedly stealing trade secrets
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.640]   from the electric car division in 2019.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.360]   In that case, Chen, a US citizen,
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.400]   also planned to travel to China.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.480]   He has not pled guilty.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.280]   He's gonna go to court.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.560]   Trial date not has not been set.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.640]   So, yeah, I wonder how systematic this is.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.760]   Sounds like it might be.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.080]   - We forget at least two spies in there.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:34.920]   - Yeah.
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.320]   - And yet the Apple store employee named Sam Sung
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.000]   was of absolute peach, perfectly fine.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.440]   He's even auctioning his name badge for charity.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.880]   You just can't protect these things.
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.240]   - You think Sam Sung, that was his real name?
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.080]   - Yeah.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:53.920]   - Yeah.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.520]   That's like he's an actual employee of Apple.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.360]   - Yeah.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.200]   - Like of Apple and Apple.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:00.600]   - And here's the auction for his,
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.040]   he's even autographed his T-shirt.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.960]   And there's his employee badge
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.240]   and his business card for the Buchanan Street,
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.720]   Apple store in Glasgow.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.240]   Sam Sung.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.640]   I guess-- - I got, wow.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.800]   - You gotta wonder if, we gotta wonder if like,
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.440]   when he applied, if they thought that this is gotta be,
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.160]   we're gonna have to do a background check
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:24.520]   'cause this could be an alias.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.360]   - That's right.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.960]   - It could be, we're being punked here.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.120]   - Current bid, 1,152.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.800]   Is that Chinese dollars?
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.720]   I don't know what the C is.
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.920]   What's the C?
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.680]   Who's currency is that?
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.520]   - Canadian.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:38.360]   Maybe it's Canadian.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.200]   - Nah.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.040]   - I don't know.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.760]   I don't know.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.960]   - Well, it's, I love this idea.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.360]   But you could get a note from him and be a Samsung note.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.200]   You could,
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.640]   (laughing)
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:50.680]   you could fold this card.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.520]   - There he is.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.760]   - And then it would be a Samsung's Galaxy Fold, right?
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.960]   He can give you access to his webcam
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.400]   and it could be Samsung watch.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.120]   There's no into this.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.480]   - Oh, and then he, no, he's in Vancouver.
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:03.520]   I thought it was Glasgow.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.960]   So then he was a specialist in Vancouver.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:06.800]   - All right.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.640]   Canadian dollar.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:11.240]   - $2,653 US dollars.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:15.360]   But oh good, look, he's donating a significant--
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.280]   - No, say it's a giant check.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.120]   Awesome.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:17.960]   - A giant check.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:18.800]   - Love it.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.640]   - He's giving a big check.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:20.480]   He's a classic guy.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.320]   Here he is on TV.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.640]   Wow.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.640]   He's making the most out of it, right?
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.480]   - Yeah.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.600]   - Yeah, that's great.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.680]   And you can follow him, Sam the Scott
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.680]   on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok for updates.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.800]   So yeah, in 2010 he worked in Glasgow
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.080]   and then in 2012 he moved to Vancouver.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:43.640]   2013 I left Apple to pursue a career in recruitment
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.880]   and head hunting.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:50.240]   In 2014 I found one of those business cards in a book.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.960]   I must have used it as a bookmark
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:56.120]   and auctioned it off for charity, $2,500 US dollars
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:59.560]   donated to Children's Wish BC in Yukon.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.640]   Then a family member found one of his business cards
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.680]   from the original store.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.800]   And it's an excellent condition.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.320]   I'm assuming he's talking like that.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.360]   I do, no.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:13.360]   And of course he's gonna put up some NFTs on OpenSea
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.280]   if you can't afford the course.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.280]   Of course he is.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.120]   Of course he is.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:18.960]   - Love it.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.960]   - We mentioned Alex the passing of John Foster some time ago
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:27.640]   and I didn't have access to this video
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:32.640]   but one of our viewers posted this on the Twitter forums.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:33.840]   A little memory.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:34.920]   Did you see it?
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:35.760]   - Yeah.
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.600]   - A little memory of John Foster.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.440]   Let me play it.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.280]   Let me play it now.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:44.360]   - Hey everybody, but especially Alex and Leo.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:48.120]   I was sad to hear that John had passed away.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:52.720]   I was a member of Pixel Core back in the day
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.720]   about 12 years ago and we had some interactions there.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:02.520]   But my favorite moment with him was one week
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.920]   when he announced on Twitter
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:08.680]   that he was going to be guesting on Mac Break.
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.720]   And he asked, you know, if there was anything
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.080]   people wanted discussed on the show.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.640]   And so I sent him a note saying,
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.200]   no, but make sure Alex says break time is over
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:25.880]   because Alex had been saying that when he was guest hosting
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.320]   and Leo was still saying another Mac break is broke
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.400]   which was the dumbest.
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.640]   (laughing)
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.480]   - Very real.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.440]   (laughing)
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.840]   - I don't think you're very sorry at all.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:40.720]   - At the end of the show and Alex started to say one,
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.160]   started to say the other was about to bail
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.280]   and John said, no, no, no, say it right.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.600]   And Alex said, break time is over.
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.920]   And I was like, yes.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:51.760]   - Aww.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.880]   - And ever since then, that's been the closing line
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.720]   for the show.
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:01.880]   So that's my John moment and my moment of internet thing
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.440]   with Mac Break Weekly.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440]   - Isn't that great?
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.080]   - Hope you guys are having a good day.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:08.920]   - Thank you.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:09.760]   - Lovely.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.280]   - His handle on the,
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.880]   on the forums is I for detail.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.720]   He's a former writer for Macworld Canada,
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.000]   editor of the smallest newspaper ever in Northern Canada
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.320]   but I don't know his real name.
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.360]   But anyway, thank you for that video.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.240]   It was great.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.400]   And do you remember that Alex?
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.920]   - Yeah, I do actually.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:33.760]   (laughing)
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.080]   - Step it up a little, go back and find it.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:40.160]   - I had forgotten that we used to say Mac break is broke.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.520]   And I agree, that was pretty dumb.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.400]   - There was a little back and forth for a while.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.720]   Any time I showed up I was like Mac break is, you know,
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.480]   so I get back to work.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.320]   - Get back to work.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.200]   'Cause break time is over.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.040]   - Yeah, so.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:52.880]   - All right.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.720]   - Well, that's why.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:54.560]   - That was just simulation people.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.400]   It's not the end of the episode.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.240]   - No, no, oh yes.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.080]   - It's just a simulation.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:57.920]   - Oh, thank you.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.760]   - Much more quickly.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.080]   - Don't turn it out, turn it out.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:00.920]   Oh boy.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.480]   - Oh, we still have the picks.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.320]   - We still have the picks.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.680]   - Still got a lot more.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:05.800]   Okay.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.640]   Anybody watch "House of the Dragon"?
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.480]   - Yep.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:10.760]   - Jason, you watched it.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.880]   Andy?
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:12.720]   - Who spoilers?
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.560]   I only saw the first five minutes.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.560]   - First five minutes?
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.440]   How could you stop?
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.200]   - I was on my phone.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.960]   I was just like, I don't watch it on your phone.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.920]   - I asked, I was made for the phone.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.920]   - I got five minutes in and I'm like,
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:24.760]   I don't wanna watch this.
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.080]   - Much of the Quibi version, what the hell?
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:30.240]   Yeah, this is the new Game of Thrones.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.040]   There was even an article in the New York Times saying,
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.960]   "Don't watch it."
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.760]   Season eight was so awful.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:37.920]   Don't watch it.
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.160]   I do think about it for a little while.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.400]   I'm still a little bitter about that.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.240]   - But apparently.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.160]   - It's a season six through eight.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:49.160]   10 million people took it seriously and watched it.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.720]   - I basically got the same ratings
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.320]   as Game of Thrones did when it premiered,
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.680]   but it went up from there.
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:54.520]   So we'll see how this one goes.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.440]   - The biggest start according to HBO
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.440]   for a series in HBO's history.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:03.680]   It started a little slow, I think by the end,
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.960]   I was pretty stoked to watch more.
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:08.960]   - Yeah, I was definitely on the fence about it.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.600]   I watched all of Game of Thrones,
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.800]   and I even did a episode by episode podcast
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.240]   for the last five seasons or something like that.
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.160]   So I retired from that, just watched as a regular civilian,
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.080]   which was great, to watch a TV show without taking notes.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:22.840]   It was amazing.
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.360]   And by the end, I was like, all right,
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.080]   I will watch more where I was not entirely convinced
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.040]   of that going in.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:31.720]   And just for the record, the people who ran
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.840]   the original Game of Thrones show are not involved,
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.680]   and you can use that as a positive or a negative,
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:38.000]   but I think a lot of people right now would say positive
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.480]   that those guys are not involved.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.320]   - New show runners.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.480]   - I thought they were very good show runners.
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:44.760]   With George RR Martin being involved too.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.080]   - It's based on his prequel book, right?
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:47.920]   He wrote it right.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:49.920]   - Exactly, he wrote basically like a history book
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:52.240]   of the backstory for Game of Thrones,
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:56.000]   and they're using some of that as the material,
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.480]   like the details, and then they add to poor
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.360]   in a lot of detail, right?
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.400]   'Cause it's really more about the high level stuff
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.320]   that George RR Martin did, but they have a lot of latitude,
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.480]   a lot more latitude, actually,
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.000]   than the Game of Thrones producers did
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.560]   in terms of what happens,
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.120]   because there's not a lot of detail in those books.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:11.960]   - Until season seven.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.080]   - Yeah, totally ran out of books.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:13.920]   That's true.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.360]   - They ran out of books, and then we realized
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.080]   they didn't actually really fit.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.600]   (laughing)
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:19.440]   - Yeah, it was--
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.280]   - No idea.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:23.320]   - I have to say, I loved Game of Thrones,
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.280]   but yeah, that was kind of a week's thing.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:30.240]   - It was great, and season six, you're like,
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.840]   and then season seven, you're like,
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:34.440]   oh, this isn't, but I can't stop now.
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.280]   - Right.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:36.120]   - In season eight, it was like, what are they just two?
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:36.960]   - What?
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.520]   - You know, and the rumor is, is that they,
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.160]   you know, the show runners were getting ready
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.560]   to go do something else they didn't want to do.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:44.680]   I mean, HBO wanted to do another two more years
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.200]   after the one, and they just wanted to close it up.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.320]   They just were like, let's wrap this up
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.360]   and move on to the next thing.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.960]   HBO has them five other--
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.600]   - They didn't have any books to live up to, right?
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.520]   - HBO has five other throne spin-offs in development.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.360]   Five.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.200]   - Right.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.040]   - Five.
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.200]   So the good news is they really have to make this one work,
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.200]   and so they're gonna spend all the monies.
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.040]   - They are.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:04.880]   - Those days are gonna look amazing.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:08.080]   - I'll say, I mean, it would be malpractice not to
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.400]   have that stuff ready to go right,
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.840]   'cause a franchise, if people are still receptive
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.880]   to this show, they're gonna have some other ones out there.
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.440]   I'll just throw out there, is one of the things
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.520]   in development is based on another,
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.320]   a series of novellas by George RR Martin.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.560]   It's the Dunkin' Egg stories, which is like Dunk is a,
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.400]   kind of an accidental hedge night,
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:29.000]   and Egg is this kid who has a very interesting
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.520]   Targaryen related backstory.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.720]   I just read that, those novellas, they're really great,
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:36.440]   and the guy who's developing that show is Stephen Conrad,
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.200]   who did Patriot, and if you haven't seen Patriot,
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.000]   it's on Amazon Prime Video.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.800]   It is so great, starring Michael Dorman.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.640]   It is one of the under-appreciated drama series
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.600]   of the last couple of decades.
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.360]   It's weird and funny, but also it's about spies,
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.640]   it's about sad spies, that's what Patriot is about.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.600]   It's about sad people who are spies.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.880]   And I try to imagine Stephen Conrad
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.280]   writing a Game of Thrones spinoff,
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.920]   and then I think about this weird buddy,
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.040]   almost buddy adventure comedy with Dunkin' Egg,
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.080]   and I think like, I really wanna see that show.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.640]   So I hope it does well,
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.920]   'cause I wanna see that other spinoff,
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:15.000]   'cause that sounds really weird and potentially great.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.160]   - Well, boy, I've learned a lot now.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:38.860]   - About the song of I
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:42.140]   - They've got these five, you say these five other series,
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:45.300]   meanwhile, like they've axed the back girl movie,
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:47.940]   they've axed all animation,
[01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:50.260]   so the new Batman animated series has gone on,
[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:51.240]   the new bug-
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.080]   - Funny movie.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.420]   - But did you see John Oliver's piece this weekend?
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:55.260]   - Yes.
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:58.500]   - He's on HBO, so he's biting the hand of Fiz Eagle.
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.860]   HBO basically attacks Dodge.
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:03.100]   (laughs)
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.540]   - Well, it's all, I mean, right,
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:05.420]   like the back girl thing,
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:07.820]   they were making original movies for HBO
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.700]   and the new management doesn't wanna make original movies
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:11.700]   just for streaming,
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:13.300]   and the animation is perplexing,
[01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:16.380]   especially since they claim that they're like
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:18.500]   super into Matt Reeves and his Batman movie,
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:19.500]   and they wanna make another one,
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.420]   but Matt Reeves was working on this animated series
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.740]   and they killed it,
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:24.660]   although potentially they might shop that around
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:26.180]   to some other outlet,
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:27.180]   but it is perplexing,
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:29.740]   and yes, at least one of these Game of Thrones spinoffs
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.820]   that's in development is animated.
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:35.940]   So I think the answer is, it's like how many bets
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:38.740]   do they wanna place on various franchises
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:42.620]   inside and outside of the HBO universe?
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.820]   'Cause also keep in mind,
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:46.340]   I think they're trying to not mess with HBO proper
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.140]   because they feel like that's the crown jewel,
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:50.900]   and some of the DC projects are a little bit outside
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:53.860]   of HBO proper and maybe more fair game,
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.780]   but who knows, they're stumbling all over everything
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:57.820]   over there.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:02.180]   - And DC has not been had the strongest track record,
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:04.260]   and so I think that if they really didn't think
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:09.260]   that the new movie was gonna go well,
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:11.580]   I think they're thinking more of the brand
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.420]   'cause they did spend $90 million on it,
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:14.940]   so I don't think it was flip-in,
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:17.500]   I think they're looking at the overall brand
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.780]   and decided that whatever happened there,
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:22.300]   we may never know what happened to that movie,
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:24.620]   but sometimes they just turn into train wrecks,
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:25.780]   there's too many requests,
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.300]   too many changes, too many things,
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.220]   and instead of just putting it out,
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:30.700]   they decided to bury it,
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:33.460]   someone burying a $90 million movie is a big barrier.
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.500]   Like that's not over or something small.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.700]   - What I heard was that it was made for streaming
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:42.460]   so they didn't have some big action set pieces
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:44.700]   that you would need to make it be theatrical,
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:47.300]   and that its death was partially because they said,
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:49.500]   look, analyze this movie,
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.940]   can we make it feel like a theatrical release,
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:53.100]   and how much would that cost?
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:54.660]   And they got back in and so they didn't like,
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.420]   and then they said, well, just forget it,
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:58.340]   because they seem to just be really committed
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:01.300]   to not releasing it as a streaming thing.
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:02.300]   And the knock against it,
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:05.620]   somebody said it felt a little bit like a pilot episode
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:07.460]   for a CW series,
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.060]   and that's really mean to say that,
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:11.020]   but there's probably some truth in that
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:13.260]   it was basically a made for TV movie,
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:16.540]   and they decided they didn't want to play that game anymore.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:18.660]   - The reality is $90 million is a lot for a TV movie,
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:22.900]   but not very much for action, action film.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:23.860]   - Yeah, it's a tweener, right?
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:27.140]   And again, the current management didn't spend
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:27.980]   the 90 million, right?
[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:29.180]   It was the previous management.
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:30.180]   And the new management,
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:31.460]   and they basically said, look,
[01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:34.220]   this isn't usable right now based on your strategy.
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:36.100]   And so we're gonna need more money,
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.700]   or, and they're like, stop right there.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:39.700]   (laughs)
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.660]   You're not getting more money, and they killed it.
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:43.500]   So it's too bad, I think it's too bad,
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:46.420]   but it's really like, it fell right in between
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.420]   the strategies that the new management has,
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:50.460]   and so they just decided to pull the plug.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:53.060]   - Yeah, and the old Hollywood saying is
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.860]   that the only thing worse than a failure
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:57.620]   is losing money on a failure,
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.620]   that was someone else's idea.
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:01.460]   So even if it had succeeded,
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:02.860]   you wouldn't be able to take the credit for it.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:05.180]   So you're just a dummy who didn't,
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.980]   instead of blaming the previous administration,
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:10.500]   and saying, yeah, we don't wanna put that money after good.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.340]   So, yeah.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:15.620]   - In the TV, Realm Apple has failed in its bid
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:18.260]   for Big Ten streaming.
[01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:20.460]   Not gonna make me cry, but, you know,
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:21.780]   they're really, they're trying to get more.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:23.140]   We talked about it last week, lots more sports.
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:24.780]   - I'm not sure how much of a player
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:25.860]   they were gonna be in that.
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:28.460]   I mean, it sounds like the Big Ten ultimately
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.460]   just decided to go with their streaming strategy
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:33.860]   as one of their broadcast partners, so it's Peacock.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:36.380]   I'm not sure, the rumors weren't really heavy
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:38.700]   about Apple or Amazon sniffing around the Big Ten.
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.980]   I think the feeling was that was probably gonna go,
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:44.820]   'cause remember Fox is the primary rights holder there,
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:46.940]   and then Fox was actually in the room negotiating
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.460]   with NBC and CBS.
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:51.340]   And in the end, I think that that's what won out is,
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:55.820]   they kept the legacy broadcast networks happy,
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:59.700]   and through the streaming games on Peacock,
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.660]   which is NBC's streaming service.
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:02.660]   So, I'm not sure.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:06.100]   I think that there are other rights coming up,
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:08.980]   ESPN's negotiating with the Pac-12,
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:10.740]   and they've got the ACC,
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:14.820]   and the Apple and Amazon are heavily rumored for those,
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:18.820]   although it'll probably all just go to ESPN and ESPN Plus.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:21.300]   But Apple, regardless of this deal
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:22.820]   and the other college football deals,
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:25.100]   like make no mistake, Apple is gonna write
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:25.940]   some big checks.
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:28.020]   We've talked about it here in the last few months.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:30.220]   There're gonna be a lot of big checks written for sports,
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.300]   because Apple thinks live sports is a way to get people
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:34.420]   to sample Apple stuff that,
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:37.260]   who haven't sampled it up to now.
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:39.220]   - I mean, the Sunday ticket's gonna be really interesting
[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:40.100]   to see where that goes.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.300]   - That's the one to watch, yeah.
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:42.140]   - That's the one to watch.
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:44.300]   - If that turns over, it's gonna be a big deal.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.540]   If it doesn't, it'll still,
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:50.420]   MLS really gives Apple a chance to innovate.
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.260]   Over the next couple of years,
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:53.180]   I bet you the first year it'll be basic.
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:55.060]   I'm like, well, this'll make it work.
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:58.020]   But then after that, within three or four years,
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:01.180]   I think we're gonna start seeing different level of coverage,
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:03.180]   AR/VR interaction.
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:04.220]   It gives them a place to do it
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:07.660]   because they don't have to deal with traditional broadcast.
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:10.540]   They don't have to deal with all the same commercial breaks
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:13.060]   and the same process, and they can do whatever they want.
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:14.380]   And so it's a really interesting thing
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:18.140]   to see what they do with that kind of open access.
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:20.900]   - Apple's expanding its self-service repair program
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:24.820]   to the M1 MacBook Air and all three M1 MacBook Pro
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:29.820]   models, some kind of limited repair types,
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:33.220]   audio board, battery for the Air,
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:35.820]   bottom case display, keycaps, logic board speaker,
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.580]   top case touch ID board, trackpad,
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.180]   fans from MacBook Pro, MagSafe from MacBook Pro,
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:42.020]   antenna modules.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:43.260]   Actually, I guess that's a lot of it.
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:45.860]   - It's not a bad selection.
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:48.940]   And it is just on the M1 laptops,
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:52.740]   not the M2, just the M1 Air and the three pros right now,
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.780]   although Apple said that there will be more,
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:57.580]   including desktops coming down the road.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:58.940]   The big thing about this, I think,
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.180]   is that it's not as intense to fix a Mac
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.860]   as it is to fix an iPhone.
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:05.980]   You don't necessarily have to rent the giant case
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:08.780]   that's got the machine that takes the screen off, right?
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:11.900]   To do this, you may be able, if you've got iFixitools,
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:14.020]   you may be able to do these repairs yourself.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:17.660]   And if that's the case with stuff you've already got,
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:20.420]   and then at that point, you're just buying
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:23.060]   the official Apple replacement part
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:24.060]   and installing it yourself.
[01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.740]   - So you could buy the part standalone,
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:28.220]   you don't have to buy the toolkit.
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:29.820]   - The tools are non-mandatory.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.220]   They'll sell them to you, they'll rent them to you,
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:34.660]   or you can just have your own tools.
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.340]   There are, I guess, in different repairs,
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:39.940]   there are a couple places where there are specialized tools,
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.580]   but there are also a bunch of different repairs that aren't.
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:44.940]   And yeah, I think this is gonna be like,
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:47.300]   if you need to do a battery replacement,
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:50.660]   you can choose to get the cheaper battery replacement
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.980]   that is from a third party,
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:53.860]   or you could say, you know,
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:55.620]   I'm just gonna get the Apple battery replacement,
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:57.300]   I'm gonna pay them and do it myself.
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:58.300]   - Get the real battery.
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.660]   - And you'll be able to do that.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:02.180]   But this is, I've seen the story spun,
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:04.820]   has been like, Apple reluctantly does this.
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:06.340]   It's like, I don't know, I think this is,
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.540]   I'm surprised that he went out with the iPhone,
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:10.780]   because the iPhone repairs are so complicated,
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:11.980]   whereas these Mac repairs, you know,
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:13.620]   everything's a little bit bigger
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:15.660]   and a little bit easier to get into.
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:17.500]   And I think it's great, the idea that Apple
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:18.740]   will give you their manual and say,
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:21.900]   here's how you fix that IO board that's bad,
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:25.340]   or, you know, whatever it is, I love it, it's great.
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:27.740]   And I should say, one of the interesting details here
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:29.660]   is some of these items are very expensive,
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:32.580]   like a Logic Board replacement for a MacBook Pro,
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:37.580]   10 core is like $1,890, $1, but for the expensive items,
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:43.420]   Apple will reimburse you for your return of the faulty one.
[01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:46.780]   So, you know, you pay $1,900 for that Logic Board,
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:49.340]   but the one you send back is worth $1,500,
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:52.180]   and so it's a $400 repair.
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:55.100]   So you get, you get to your money back
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:56.260]   for the expensive repairs.
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:57.100]   - That's not bad at all.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:58.580]   - It's never gonna be the best deal,
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:01.140]   but it is like the official Apple sanction deal,
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:02.140]   and I think that's a good thing.
[01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:03.140]   - Right, yeah.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:05.460]   And there are a lot of people who don't have access to,
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:07.740]   easy access to an Apple store for people
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:10.220]   that it's like a three hour or four hour drive,
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:12.460]   they'd much rather just wrestle with it at home.
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:14.140]   I just wish that they would go all the way
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:17.300]   and make it super, super easy for third party repair shops
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:19.820]   and not necessarily be fully certified by Apple,
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:20.980]   but to simply be able to say,
[01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:24.140]   "Look, I know that the problem is with the motherboard
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:27.060]   because I see this smoking crater in the middle
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:29.020]   of this motherboard, so I'm guessing that that's the thing
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:29.860]   that needs to be swapped out.
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:31.660]   Just sell me a motherboard.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:33.660]   This person does not have the skills or the interest
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:36.700]   in swapping it out themselves, but I know what I'm doing,
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:39.420]   so just please release the right hardware to me.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.940]   I will send you the broken motherboard back.
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:44.300]   I think that's what a lot of people would like to have happen,
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:47.300]   but it's nice that they're doing something better than nothing,
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:48.940]   and this is literally better than nothing.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:54.020]   - Mr. Jason Snell found a little bit of a bug in,
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:56.060]   what is this, iOS?
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:42:00.460]   - This is macOS Spentura, system settings app.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:02.620]   - Which they've replaced the control panel now
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:05.300]   with the preference panes now with the system settings app.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:08.260]   - So this is, you know, I was looking in the Finder extensions,
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:10.660]   which is in a weird place, and I scroll through the list,
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:11.980]   and you know, there's things from Automator
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:13.820]   and things from shortcuts, and they're all different sizes,
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:15.260]   which is really ugly, and I thought,
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:17.420]   wow, this size disparity needs to be fixed.
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:19.020]   And then I scrolled a little further,
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.660]   and there was a spotlight icon of size of your head.
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:25.220]   And then just move along, and then there's motor icons,
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:28.020]   and I thought there's something is wrong there, something--
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:29.180]   - Little bugs. - She's gone wrong.
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:30.740]   - Little tiny bug.
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:33.140]   As somebody said, we're gonna need a bigger modal dialer.
[01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:35.340]   - I'm sure they'll fix it, but it shows you that,
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:37.700]   like, I think this may be an area of interface
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:40.180]   that nobody has ventured into at Apple,
[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:43.180]   and noticed, I don't know why the spotlight icon
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:46.140]   is eight times the size of anything else in that screen.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:50.620]   It's a missed eight, 80, something, 800 times the size.
[01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:54.500]   But, you know, that whole app is a mess right now,
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.740]   and I hope they, you know, they, like we were talking
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:59.140]   about a stage manager, they've got an extra month
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:01.900]   to fix things in the settings app,
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.860]   but I didn't, you know, it's just really disappointing,
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:05.900]   'cause the system preferences app,
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:08.700]   so desperately needed to be replaced by something else,
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:10.380]   and it's really, 'cause it was really hurting,
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:13.140]   and not working very well, and was really based on,
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:16.260]   like, the screen sizes of Macs in 2001,
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:18.060]   and they give us the settings app,
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:20.060]   and it's such, it's so dispiriting,
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:22.060]   'cause it is, doesn't work right,
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.900]   and it still doesn't take advantage
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:26.180]   of the screen sizes we have today.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:29.500]   It's really modal, it's got hierarchies that are invisible.
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:33.020]   It's a mess, so they've got a little time to fix it,
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:35.340]   but not much, not much,
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:38.500]   because if you're gonna just put it out in October,
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:42.260]   you gotta have it finalized by September,
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:44.300]   early September, I would think.
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:45.980]   - I'm surprised at you, Jason, though.
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:47.580]   You're a tech blogger.
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:51.740]   This is your crystal clear opportunity to say,
[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:56.060]   I've confirmed Apple working on 278-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.460]   (laughing)
[01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:00.020]   - I mean, don't forget that this is icon gate, right?
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:03.500]   This is, why are the icons all different sizes?
[01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:04.700]   Why is there a large icon?
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:06.740]   Icon gate, macOS Ventura doesn't care
[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:08.460]   about your icon sizes.
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:09.740]   Well, I'm sure somebody will write that.
[01:44:09.740 --> 01:44:12.340]   - I'm gonna guess there was a missing asset,
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:14.180]   and it just picked the next one up.
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:15.940]   That was a little bigger than they expected.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.820]   - It could be.
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:20.300]   And I went in there because I very specifically,
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:21.580]   like this is one of those weird areas
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:23.500]   where you've got stuff that you used to be able
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.420]   to plug into the system from Automator.
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:26.900]   And these are Automator actions,
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:28.820]   and I use those to automate all sorts of stuff
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:32.140]   in the Finder, and those are these little icons that you set.
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:33.740]   And they changed it a little bit
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:36.100]   when the touch bar came out, but basically they're the same.
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:38.180]   And then there's shortcuts you can put in there now.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:39.980]   And they share that space.
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:42.340]   And that's great, except the icons are,
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:44.180]   like these are black and white, and these are color,
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:45.460]   and these are big, and these are little,
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:47.300]   and they're all kind of mishmashed together.
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.140]   And there's nobody apparently to say,
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:51.460]   "Well, wait a second, this looks terrible."
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:52.460]   We need to fix this.
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:54.700]   - That's where you get a call by Steve Jobs
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:57.180]   in the middle of the night, saying.
[01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:59.060]   - Have you seen the size of the spotlight icon?
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:00.220]   - What is going on?
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:03.980]   - Let's take a break, and then if you will,
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:06.220]   your picks of the week coming up next
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:08.500]   our show today brought to you by those great folks
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:10.220]   at New Relic.
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:14.580]   I know a lot of devs, I'm kind of their mascot, right?
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:16.540]   Devs are great.
[01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:18.340]   I mean, they're curious.
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:19.780]   The first to explore a new tech,
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:23.260]   they dig into documentation, they actually read documentation.
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:25.940]   They want to know not only how things work, but why?
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:28.660]   And I think that's the group,
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:32.180]   that's the people who turn to New Relic.
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:34.700]   New Relic gives you all the data
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:37.580]   about what you build, the information you need,
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:41.740]   and shows what's really happening in your software lifecycle.
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:45.780]   It's a single place to see the data from your entire stack.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:46.980]   It really saves you time.
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:49.060]   You don't have to look at a bunch of different tools
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.820]   and connect them manually.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:54.700]   You get 16 tools all within one,
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:56.180]   and boy are these powerful,
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:58.780]   from application monitoring to full stack,
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:01.980]   and it pinpoints issues down to the line of code.
[01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:05.540]   So you know why the problems are happening,
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.980]   and you can resolve them quickly.
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:11.780]   They are a favorite of dev and ops teams at DoorDash
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:14.060]   and GitHub and Epic Games.
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:17.020]   One of the 14,000 companies used New Relic
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.140]   to debug and improve their software.
[01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:21.820]   When teams come together around data,
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:23.940]   New Relic allows you to triage problems,
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:26.420]   be confident in the decisions you're making,
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:29.540]   and reduce the time needed to implement resolutions,
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:31.060]   using data, not opinions.
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:33.580]   Isn't it what we really want is data?
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:35.860]   Use the data platform made for the curious.
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:38.660]   Right now you get access to the whole New Relic platform,
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:43.060]   and 100 gigabytes of data per month, free, forever.
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:45.540]   Yes, no credit card required.
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:47.740]   Just go to newrelick.com/macbreak,
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:52.340]   any W-R-E-L-I-C.com/macbreak,
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:54.660]   get the whole platform, all 16 tools,
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:57.060]   and 100 gigabytes of data a month free,
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:59.020]   forever, no credit card needed.
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:02.900]   New Relic.com/macbreak, thank you, New Relic,
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:04.900]   for supporting Macbreak Weekly.
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:06.380]   You support us when you go to that address,
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:10.100]   New Relic.com/macbreak.
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:14.540]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week time.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:17.220]   I'm using my pick of the week.
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:18.900]   So we talked about it a little bit before the show,
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:21.940]   but I have a, this is, I got this from Courtney Gooden.
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:24.620]   Courtney Gooden is in office hours,
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:26.820]   and he had this mic that he was using,
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:28.060]   and I was like, oh, it really sounds nice,
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:30.500]   but Courtney's voice is so good that I was like,
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.340]   it may not be, it may not be the mic.
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:34.500]   So anyway, but I've been testing,
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.460]   I've been heavy testing, heavily testing mics.
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:38.140]   I don't know, I've got eight or nine of them
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:39.100]   floating around right now,
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:41.260]   trying to find good mics to send out to people
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:42.660]   for some of our podcasts.
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:47.220]   And so I saw his, I was like, well, he sounds pretty good,
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:49.180]   it's only $200, I'll give it a shot.
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:51.420]   So this is the Stellar X2.
[01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:53.460]   So you can decide if you're listening to the show,
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.260]   whether you like it or not, there's no processing.
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:57.660]   So there's no compression, no anything else.
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:59.140]   - I think it sounds pretty good.
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:00.260]   I'll be honest with you.
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:01.100]   - It sounds pretty good.
[01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:01.940]   - Yeah.
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:05.860]   So it's a large-ish diaphragm mic.
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:10.860]   It's designed to sound a lot like a U87,
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:13.980]   the Neumann U87, and so that's kind of what they've been,
[01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:16.060]   they were shooting for, I believe.
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:17.380]   They don't say that, of course, on the website,
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.580]   'cause that would get them in trouble.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:22.980]   But anyway, but it's a Stellar X2, it's $200.
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:25.660]   They have a new one, it's an X3 that now that I saw it,
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:27.020]   I was like, why didn't I just get that one?
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:29.380]   But this is a really good one.
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:33.940]   But I will say for $199 is probably the best sounding mic
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:34.940]   that I've gotten.
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:36.580]   - Yeah, for that price, wow.
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:37.420]   - Yeah.
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.260]   - And a lot of the folks decided
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:40.060]   it sounded better than my Neumann, which was,
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:41.740]   I think you said at the beginning.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:42.580]   - It does sound better.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:43.900]   I felt like the Neumann is a little bit better.
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:45.820]   - My voice sounds better, yeah.
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:48.300]   - Yeah, so this is really good value.
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:52.180]   People always ask, well, is this the mic I should get?
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:53.340]   Well, it depends.
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:55.820]   - Everybody should get a different mic, yeah.
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:58.220]   - You know, that's one of the things I did
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:48:59.380]   is I started getting all these mics
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:01.100]   'cause I was like, I want to be in the same place,
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:02.980]   testing a whole bunch of different mics
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:05.060]   and figure out like, how does my voice sound
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:06.540]   with these mics and this environment?
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:09.140]   Like I opened this up, I was traveling on Thursday and Friday
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.780]   so I was jumping into office hours from a hotel
[01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:13.580]   that looked really good on hotels.com.
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.740]   And when I got there, there was no carpets, no nothing.
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:17.300]   Like it was very hard.
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:19.660]   And I was like, well, this is gonna not be great audio.
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:21.260]   And when I started listening to it,
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:23.220]   I could hear the whole room, 'cause it's like,
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:24.060]   'cause it's probably more sensitive.
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:25.340]   - That's a 12 more sensor mics, yeah.
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.900]   - So then I switched over to a dynamic
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:28.500]   and it went, it was fine, right?
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:33.500]   You know, and I also hung the comforter over the TV,
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.820]   which turns out to be a great way to stop audio
[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:39.060]   from bouncing off of the wall.
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:40.820]   And but anyway, the point is,
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:43.580]   is that it is in a quiet environment
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:45.260]   where you have a little bit of something
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:47.660]   to suck up some of the reflections.
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:50.660]   I think it's a really, really good mic for the,
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:52.820]   I mean, I think it's the best mic I've had
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:54.060]   for the price, you know, for one.
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:55.940]   - Yeah, no kidding for 200 bucks.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:59.140]   Stellar X2 Large Capsule Condenser Microphone,
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:04.620]   TechZone Audio Products Dot Com.
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:05.460]   - Yeah.
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:06.500]   - Yeah, I mean, it's kinda cool.
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.220]   You can use it and we can hear it and we know.
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.980]   - Yeah, you know, you can decide.
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:12.140]   - So if you listen to the last week's show,
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:13.380]   you'll be like, well, you can decide
[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:15.020]   whether that sounds better or worse than this one.
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:15.940]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:18.260]   And that one last week was a little more expensive.
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:19.180]   - Three times, yeah.
[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:20.020]   - Three times as much.
[01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:21.020]   - Yeah.
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:24.780]   - Thank you, Alex, Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:28.180]   - It's time for me to like start that long haul process
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:30.740]   of upgrading all of my chargers once again,
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:31.820]   because they keep getting better
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:33.100]   after every three or four years
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:36.580]   and this is the first GAN charger that I've ever bought
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:39.420]   and it really put me on the bandwagon for them.
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:42.860]   So this is Anker's like Nano two, seven, 35,
[01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:44.020]   65 watt charger.
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:45.860]   - That's a 65 watt charger.
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:46.700]   - It's dying.
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:49.300]   - Yeah, and it does, it's like, I like Anker products.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:50.620]   They're very, very reliable for me too.
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:53.140]   And also I like the way this is really set up
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:56.980]   where if I'm coming home on the commuter rail,
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:50:58.980]   I can use both of these USB-C ports
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:03.060]   to power up and charge my iPad and my phone.
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:05.700]   I'll still have a USB style port
[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:08.380]   that I can use to charge a third thing, no problem.
[01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:10.620]   And it will of course split those 65 watts
[01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:12.460]   above across those three devices,
[01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:15.540]   but it means I can actually be using these three devices
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:17.540]   while I'm charging these three devices.
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:20.580]   But if I only, if I wanna put all the entire 65 watt
[01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:23.220]   on one device, if I wanna fast charge my iPad,
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:25.380]   wanna fast charge my MacBook,
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:27.540]   I can just use just one of these ports
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:29.460]   and intelligently put these together.
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:32.220]   And it's nice and tiny, it's really compact.
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:36.180]   It has those folding plug ports.
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:39.500]   And it's not super cheap, it's like 59 bucks.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:43.060]   But once the thing is like, it's hard to put a price
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:47.340]   on having one less piece of junk inside your laptop bag.
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:50.420]   And for me, if I'm like spending like a couple days
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:52.020]   in New York to a three days in New York,
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:54.020]   I will have like a second charger,
[01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:56.900]   maybe even a third charger to make sure that
[01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:59.380]   like I can get everything recharged overnight
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:01.180]   at my hotel room or wherever I'm staying.
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:03.020]   Whereas this will do the job for me.
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:04.820]   Again, if you don't want fast charging,
[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:07.380]   you can use all three ports and it'll happen just fine.
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:10.300]   And it will still do the thing where a crumb,
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:12.180]   I only have 18% left on my phone
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:14.500]   and I have to leave for the airport in like an hour.
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:18.700]   It'll force feed that phone pretty nicely.
[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.220]   And again, it's anchor, so it's reliable, it's good,
[01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:24.020]   it's well built, it feels like a real thing.
[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:27.580]   And like I bought this first one sort of tentatively
[01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:29.700]   because I'm like, okay, well does it really work well?
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.620]   'Cause I'm just a, I kind of almost have to get a sharpie
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:35.860]   and take all of my older chargers and write down
[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:37.700]   what doesn't work well about them.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:40.220]   Like, okay, now it will kind of fast charge
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.900]   but you have to use only this port.
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:44.260]   I know it has three, but if you don't use the right one,
[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:46.180]   it won't fast charge and you'll be very, very sad
[01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:47.420]   in an hour and a half.
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:51.780]   This other one will be, there's the wrong kinds of ports
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.900]   and it's only 20 water, 25 watts.
[01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.020]   I'm still gonna keep them,
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:57.700]   I'm probably just gonna keep them like nearby,
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:59.700]   like in the living room nearby in different places
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:02.340]   where some of my devices land up.
[01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:06.780]   But I'm gonna start the slow slog of making sure
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:10.500]   there's one of these for like my one day in Boston laptop bag,
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:14.380]   another one of these in my two days in New York laptop bag
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:16.340]   and a third one in the bag that I take
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:18.340]   when I'm gonna be gone for three or four or five days
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:20.900]   because if there isn't one in each bag,
[01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:23.100]   at some point I will steal from one bag
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.180]   to power something or charge something,
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:27.180]   I'll forget to put it back in once again.
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:29.340]   I'll be like on the Amtrak train, very sad
[01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:30.980]   because my back doesn't have a charger in it.
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:32.420]   So, well, worthwhile.
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:35.140]   I think this is gonna be worth my 60 bucks times three or four.
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:36.100]   - Yeah, very compact.
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:39.340]   We actually have the Nano One.
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:41.140]   - Yeah. - I mean, quite a few of these.
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:43.020]   It's actually labeled Nano One.
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:45.700]   So it's like they knew they were gonna do a Nano Two, I guess.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:48.220]   But this is also 65 wide.
[01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:51.020]   I love these GAN chargers 'cause they're so compact
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:52.820]   and they don't get as hot.
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:55.660]   You could charge either one of these devices
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:57.900]   could charge your MacBook at full speed.
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:59.900]   That's pretty good. - Yep.
[01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:01.060]   - Thank you, anchor.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:04.620]   And I see they have a coupon code for $14 off right now
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:05.460]   at the website.
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:07.300]   So this might be the time.
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:09.620]   - I bought the first one at full price for Amazon
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:12.620]   and now fortunately this show has saved me $14
[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:14.340]   because maybe I'll just buy both of them right now.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:15.740]   - That's it, that's it. - Yeah.
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:16.780]   - That's it, that's it. - That's it.
[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:17.620]   - Thank you, Andy.
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:21.140]   Mr. Jason Snell pick of the Wii.
[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:24.620]   - Yeah, it's a two for this time because about a month ago,
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:27.140]   I recommended Swift Bar, which is a great app
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:29.540]   that lets you put anything in your menu bar.
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:32.260]   And I wanna, I got some feedback where it's like,
[01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:34.580]   well, it's very technical and it's got lots of shell scripts
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:35.580]   and stuff like that.
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:37.420]   And then you gotta go download it from some website
[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:40.300]   that's got a, it's a GitHub page.
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:43.460]   Okay, there's an app called One Thing, it's free.
[01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:44.980]   - This is the opposite. - This is the opposite.
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:46.180]   - This is the complete opposite.
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:49.060]   - It does literally the same thing as Swift Bar,
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:52.140]   but it's a single instance, it lives in your menu bar,
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:55.620]   it's free, and then you can use a shell script
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:56.860]   or something if you want to feed it.
[01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:59.540]   You can drag text to it and the text just goes
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:02.500]   in your menu bar or this is the good one,
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:05.460]   you can run a shortcut and have the shortcut set
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.380]   the menu bar to be whatever you want it to be.
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:10.140]   It's an item in your menu bar that can contain data,
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:12.860]   it could be a pep talk, it could be a,
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:13.860]   anything you want.
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:17.180]   And my friend Joe Steele told me about this
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:19.900]   because he was reluctant to have the whole Swift Bar experience
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:23.140]   and this is a lot less nerdy and I think it's a good free app
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:25.820]   that will let you put anything you want in your menu bar.
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:30.140]   What Joe did is he used shortcuts and home kit
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:32.980]   to get his weather station out in his backyard
[01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:35.060]   to display the current temperature in his house
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:38.260]   in his menu bar, all using just shortcuts and one thing
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:41.220]   without any, you know, any Python scripting
[01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:42.940]   or shell scripting or anything like that.
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:47.540]   Just his home kit data and one thing.
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:49.540]   The only problem with that is what do you do
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:51.860]   to get it to update regularly?
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:56.580]   And when Joe wrote about this, a reader wrote in and said,
[01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:57.700]   "Oh, I've got the app for you."
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:00.580]   And it is very cool, it is called Shortery.
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:04.020]   Shortery is the feature that totally should be
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:06.380]   in shortcuts on the Mac and isn't yet,
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:10.220]   which is a free app within that purchase
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.740]   and it lets you do automation for shortcuts on the Mac.
[01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:15.220]   So based on different changes on your Mac
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:18.180]   or just based on time, run this shortcut every 20 minutes.
[01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:20.100]   So you could set it up to check your weather
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:23.380]   in your backyard and update one thing every 15 minutes,
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:26.700]   every 20 minutes for as long as your Mac is up and running,
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:28.260]   but you can do lots of other things.
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:30.340]   And this is a thing that there's some automation,
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:31.860]   it's limited that there's some automation
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:35.740]   for shortcuts on iOS, but on Mac OS there's nothing.
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:38.220]   And I think that's what we call in the biz,
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:40.980]   a third party opportunity.
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:44.100]   And here it is, Shortery, and it is free.
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:47.300]   And then if you want the extra kind of bonus automation level,
[01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:49.460]   there's a one time in that purchase
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:50.980]   of I think it's like three or four bucks.
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:53.020]   So put those two things together,
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:54.740]   you can automate anything out of shortcuts
[01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:56.220]   and put it in your menu bar.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:59.420]   Very nice, Shortery, that's from
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:04.940]   LG, R, C-K-E-N-S.de.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:11.100]   Oh, gherkins. Oh, forget it.
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:13.500]   Anyway, just search for Shortery Mac OS,
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.660]   I think you'll probably find it a little bit faster doing that.
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:20.700]   And then of course, the one thing is from
[01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:23.700]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:25.340]   - Listen, they're in the app store.
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:27.540]   Search for one thing in Shortery in the app store.
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:28.620]   - Who's in the app store?
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:29.460]   - Yep.
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:32.460]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:35.220]   Don't know what country that person's from either.
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:36.340]   Thank you, Jason Snell.
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:41.340]   You catch Jason at work and play at sixcolors.com.
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:46.540]   He is prolific to say the least.
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:48.940]   - Get busy soon, get busy, get busy.
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:50.620]   - Get busy.
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:52.460]   You also can listen to his podcast.
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:55.140]   He's got a whole podcast page there and many, many podcasts.
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:56.980]   But actually, if you just go to sixcolors.com,
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:59.420]   when they come out, he makes that a post there.
[01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:03.700]   So it's an easy way to keep up with what Jason's up to.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:05.340]   Thank you, Jason, it's a real pleasure.
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:07.100]   - Thank you, Leo.
[01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:10.900]   - Andy and Aco, when are you gonna be on GBH next?
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:12.020]   - Got a little bit of a summer break.
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:13.780]   I'm off this week and then the whole show
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:16.900]   was dark next week and repeats for the summer break.
[01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:21.900]   But first week after, first day, first Friday after Labor Day,
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:25.980]   I'll probably be talking about the iPhone news
[01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:27.460]   and other things from the Apple event.
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:30.180]   Go to WGBHNews.org and you can actually see
[01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:32.580]   the last time I was on just last week
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:34.820]   and see all the previous things they've done.
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:39.820]   And of course, Anatco.com, which will soon be blossoming
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:42.620]   into a new host next week. - New host next week.
[01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:43.980]   - Oh, yeah, nice.
[01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:46.820]   IHN-A-T-K-O.
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:50.780]   Alex Lindsey is the Mater D at office hours
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:52.860]   at officehours.global.
[01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:55.380]   You do amazing things over there.
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:56.940]   - We had such a great morning for this morning.
[01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:58.740]   - Synthesizers.
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:01.260]   - So, Karl Asmucin is one of our members
[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:03.260]   from Adelaide, Australia.
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:06.220]   And so he gave us a half an hour overview
[01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:07.540]   of how a synthesizer works.
[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:09.860]   He had an analog synthesizer with a camera over top of it
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:12.220]   and he's just walking through like this is how
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:13.660]   the oscillator works.
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:17.300]   This is the LFO, it had the amp,
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:20.260]   the all the thing, how the envelopes feed into it
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.900]   and he gave us this kind of great overview
[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:23.340]   is the second hour 'cause the first hour
[01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:24.180]   is always just dusting.
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:26.020]   - Yeah, yeah, here's the sixth exercise.
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:28.460]   - But so he's kind of, so it's like a half an hour
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:32.580]   of a breakdown and we're getting ready to do
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:34.620]   workshops in after hours.
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:36.620]   The part that runs 21 hours a day
[01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:39.460]   instead of the only the two hours that office hours runs.
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:42.980]   So he was showing that off and then when we started
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:46.460]   answering questions, I realized we have Courtney Gooden,
[01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:48.100]   who was talking about earlier with her mic,
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.260]   who've done, he goes, oh, I used this synthesizer
[01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:52.340]   for the effects for honey, I blew up the kids.
[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:53.340]   He's talking about that.
[01:59:53.340 --> 01:59:54.180]   - Oh, wow.
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:56.020]   - And he's out of LA and then Nick Bat.
[01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:58.020]   And Nick Bat is, he's from D.
[01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:59.180]   - Oh, wow.
[01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:01.820]   - And he's out of LA and then Nick Bat.
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:05.260]   He's from DNA, they're mostly, they're most known for
[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:10.300]   Tom's Diner, Suzanne Vega's kind of dance version
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:11.220]   of Tom's Diner.
[02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:14.340]   So Nick Bat, who was part of DNA that did that,
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:16.620]   as well as working with Goldfrap and others,
[02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:19.020]   he's on their answering questions about this stuff.
[02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:23.100]   And then Carl was answering it from answering questions
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.780]   from Australia, I was like, we got three continents,
[02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:26.340]   like sitting there answering people's questions
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:28.620]   about synthesizers and we're gonna be doing,
[02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:29.780]   you know, it was crazy.
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:32.820]   I was just like, it was just a crazy experience
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:35.500]   and it was really, it got really geeky.
[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:37.780]   I mean, people kept on throwing questions about synthesizers.
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:40.060]   I was like, oh, they're gonna stump these guys, not a one.
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:43.100]   Like these guys stuck in like, no, actually, you know,
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:46.740]   and they got in these deep philosophical answers about
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:48.900]   synthesizers I'd never heard of before.
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:51.260]   So it was about why this one's good and bad
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:53.260]   and what it does and where it came from and why it was there.
[02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:55.180]   And so it's just, we're gonna do this once a month
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:57.460]   is just synthesizers on our audio days,
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:58.460]   which are typically Tuesdays.
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:00:59.660]   So anyway, a lot of fun.
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:01.820]   If you're interested, officehours.global,
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:04.220]   you can get an invitation to join the Zoom conference live
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:06.860]   or watch it after the fact there's YouTube as well.
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:07.900]   Officehours.global.
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:10.860]   And if you wanna hire Alex to do his thing,
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:15.260]   090.media is the place.
[02:01:15.260 --> 02:01:17.940]   Thank you, all three of you, for joining us.
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:21.180]   We do Mac Break Weekly's weekly on Tuesdays
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:25.580]   at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1,800 UTC.
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:27.260]   You can watch us do it live.
[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:30.620]   Be the very first person to hear Mac Break Weekly
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:35.620]   in your friend group by going to live.twit.tv.
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:38.300]   You could chat live at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:40.460]   Of course, club members can also chat with us
[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:41.820]   in the club twit discord.
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:44.820]   That's a fabulous place to hang out.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:48.260]   Thursday, we're gonna be doing Stacy's book club
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:52.260]   and I am rushing through Clara and the sun
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:56.540]   'cause I wanna be there for that 9 a.m. Pacific on Thursday.
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:57.580]   This is for club members.
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:01:59.900]   We do a lot of interesting things in the club.
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:02.340]   We have shows that appear only in the club
[02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:04.780]   like Hands on Mac with Michael Sergeant,
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:06.500]   Hands on Windows with Paul Therrot,
[02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:09.260]   The Ultimate Linux Show with Jonathan Bennett.
[02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:12.660]   We also do the Gizfiz with Dick D. Bartolo.
[02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:14.940]   Those all appear on the Twit Plus feed.
[02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:17.500]   Also as a member, you get ad-free versions of all the shows.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:21.380]   I think this is a lot of content for seven bucks a month.
[02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:24.220]   And that seven bucks a month is very helpful to us,
[02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:26.220]   both in developing new shows.
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:29.460]   And just supporting the network as a whole.
[02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:30.300]   It really helps.
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:33.300]   So if you're not yet a member of club twit, I urge you,
[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:38.300]   I invite you, I beseech you, visit twit.tv/club twit.
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:41.580]   Ad-free versions of the shows and more
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:43.900]   for just seven bucks a month.
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:45.140]   There's a yearly plan.
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:48.500]   There's also a enterprise plan if you wanna do that.
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:51.540]   We have gift certificates, that kind of thing.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:54.460]   Club twit, twit.tv/club twit.
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:57.620]   After the show's over, we do also have
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.620]   ad-supported versions for you for free
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:03.300]   at our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:05.180]   You can also watch on YouTube.
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:07.420]   There's a dedicated YouTube channel, the Mac, break weekly.
[02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:09.980]   There's also, of course, the option is subscribe
[02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:12.300]   in your favorite podcast player, 'cause it is a podcast.
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:13.820]   We'd love it if you'd subscribe that way,
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:17.140]   get it automatically as soon as it's available.
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:19.820]   Plus subscribers get a chance to do something really important.
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:22.220]   Give us a five-star review, please,
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:25.700]   on your favorite podcast platform.
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:28.580]   Thanks to everybody for being here.
[02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:30.540]   Thanks guys, and we'll see you all next week.
[02:03:30.540 --> 02:03:33.180]   And now another Mac break is broke.
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:37.580]   No, no, oh, oh, get back to work.
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:40.540]   Get back to work, 'cause break time is broke.
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:42.580]   It's over, it's over, break time's over.
[02:03:42.580 --> 02:03:44.540]   Thanks everybody, we'll see you next time.
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.180]   Thank you Alex.
[02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:48.860]   - Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor-in-chief of Ad Astor Magazine.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:50.860]   And each week I joined with my co-host
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:52.380]   to bring you this week in space,
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:54.980]   the latest and greatest news from the final frontier.
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:57.580]   We talked to NASA chiefs, space scientists, engineers,
[02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:00.620]   educators, and artists, and sometimes we just shoot the breeze
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:03.500]   over what's hot and what's not in space books and TV.
[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:06.380]   And we do it all for you, our fellow true believers.
[02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:08.340]   So whether you're an armchair adventurer,
[02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:11.140]   or waiting for your turn to grab a slot in Elon's Mars rocket,
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:12.940]   join us on this week in space
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:15.540]   and be part of the greatest adventure of all time.
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:18.140]   (upbeat music)
[02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:20.720]   (upbeat music)
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:23.300]   (upbeat music)
