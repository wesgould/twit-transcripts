[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.100]   certain sense of humility while hobnobbing with incredibly wealthy and talented musicians,
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.840]   and please for heaven's sakes, don't drill a hole in your iPhone 7. That man on YouTube
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:49.040]   was just kidding.

[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.440]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. I'm Andy Inato of the Scrago Sun Times taking the host
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.840]   chair away from Leo the Port. And we all have been looking at his Instagram over the past
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.320]   couple of weeks. I will say that he is appearing in a lot of photos in which he is in a white
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.360]   tuxedo in exotic signature European locales with a beautiful woman on his arm. So I'm
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.080]   not saying he's a secret agent on a mission we can't talk about. I'm simply strongly
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.000]   implying it. But with us is of course Rene Richie of Imore Rene. How was your week been?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.400]   Oh, excellent. Thank you. I can't believe you blew 002's cover like that. Well, they're
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.800]   not going to track them down without the number, but now they got the number. So that's fine.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.960]   No, he's having a waggle time and I'm looking forward to the reign of Andy. Oh, no, no,
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.880]   I'm sorry. But if the Smursh agents kill him and we're stuck hosting, we're going to
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.200]   switch this off man because it's a lot more work. I mean, we cannot do doing Leo's job
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.240]   once in a while is fun. But weekly, I've got pancakes to eat on Tuesday morning. Speaking
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.320]   of pancakes, pancakes and playing bacon, which is one of the signature products of the
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:02.840]   land of learning your cohorts birth. Jim Dallerim, Jim Dallerimple of the loop. Jim,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.720]   how you doing? How you doing Andy? Monterately, Nito, you're like, you're like so, you'll be
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.800]   so bronzed. You know, it's, it's a thing. I, I don't know. And sometimes I wake up and
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.480]   I'm just so sexy that it, it's, it's hard to explain. It really is. I feel bad for other
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.440]   people. I mean, I feel bad for myself, but that was going to happen anyway. Now, I never
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.800]   occurred to you that like you look, you know, I also have a little bit of, well, okay, my
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.600]   majority of the gray like in my facial hair, maybe like you're actually benefiting because
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.120]   the white in your beard is like acting as like sort of a sun reflector, which is like
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.360]   giving you like that really nice healthy glow all the time.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.620]   Well, it's an antenna too, I think. It's I get, I get amazing iPhone reception no matter
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.680]   where I am, I can be on a mountain or something. It's great. Now, when did you upgrade the
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.120]   beard to five gigahertz? It doesn't have that steering antenna technology too. So we
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.400]   can just locate the beer can locate devices in the room. Can't talk about that. Oh, forgot
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.280]   the beard is also Mike. Sorry. Anyway, we'll let's move past that. And very, very special
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.920]   guest. We haven't had her on in quite a while. Thank goodness we've got her on today. Kelly
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.600]   Gomont from the Mac Observer and app camp for girls. Kelly, how you doing? She's been abducted.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.360]   You've already lost her. Oh, sorry. I'm recovering from all the sexy there full screen a second
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:43.800]   ago. Who? I know. I tell you what. There is definitely a case of the vapors going on
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.120]   and at least two of these chairs. I'm not going to say who's the second. I am saying
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.840]   that I'm going to screen cap some of this for later if you know what I mean. We have
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:03.160]   had quite quite a week. You know, it's the traditional iPhone iOS Apple Watch launch cycle
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.280]   where you get the first week in which only the people who got early hardware or got launch day
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.360]   hardware. I guess to talk about it and it's all very, very new. And then there's the second week
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.920]   in which more people get it and the people who've had it for a week have now had it for two weeks
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.560]   and it's had a chance to break these people's hearts. And then there's the third week when
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.760]   everybody's had it. Now there's 2 million people with iPhones maybe and so a broad swath of experiences
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.520]   and if there's anything that's going to go wrong with these things, it's going to happen in week
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.840]   three and that's when the backlash starts to go. Renee, I think that what most people are going to
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.120]   want to know right now is when are they going to be able to get their hands on iPhones because
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.160]   they are like hens teeth. Yeah, no, I mean, it happens every year and there's always some reason
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.680]   for it or another. Maybe they can't make enough processors, maybe they can't make enough screens.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.800]   And this here, it sounds like the jet black finish is the huge part of constraint where
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.720]   there's just simply not enough yield on those super shiny, super glossy jet black iPhones. And
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.520]   if you ordered one of those, you are going to be waiting a little while. If you like rose gold,
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.600]   though, Andy, you can you can walk in. Well, who doesn't like rose gold? I think it was the one
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.040]   their backup singers in the in the Reneets in 1958 rose gold replacement for the first one.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.120]   But yeah, and that's so I'm reading the stuff Apple insider and the other places are blaming
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:37.240]   part of the shortage on international freight. It was the beavers they built a log jam and they
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.600]   wanted their iPhones so the bullets had to wait. I'm sorry, blame Canada. I will again, another
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.840]   thing we were going to do anyway, but it's good that you're on our side about this. But it's
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:55.240]   Jim, how how responsible is Apple for making sure that demand is kept up with? I mean, is it
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.560]   is it even do you think it's even a priority for them to make sure that everybody who wants a phone
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.400]   the first couple of weeks can at least see the light in the tunnel? Of course, I mean, nobody
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:14.120]   wants to go into a sales season and not have enough product ready. I mean, there's a couple of
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:22.120]   different ways that that you can look at pre orders either they sold so many that they completely
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.240]   burned through the stock that they had, which is a great thing, or that they didn't have enough
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.840]   stock and they just burned through what little pre orders they had typically for Apple.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:40.520]   They they plan very well and they have a lot of product available for pre order and then they
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:47.000]   they catch up and we're seeing that already, but nobody wants to to have a launch a pre order of
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.480]   a product and not have enough available. So I think they take that very seriously and we've seen Apple
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:00.440]   in years past how seriously they take the chain in in getting product to market. So
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.760]   yeah, I don't think it's something that they do on purpose and there's no way to actually tell.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:15.880]   Yeah, there's no way to tell how many they've sold. Yeah, and Apple isn't telling that they kind of
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.480]   I was surprised it was two or three weeks ago that Apple said that, hey, guys, we're not going to be
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.960]   talk we're not going to be telling you how many we sold in the first weekend. And oftentimes, if they
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.600]   had even a marginally really good success with it, they will saying, Oh, we're very congratulations
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:37.560]   to the entire team for rolling out selling 5.8 kajillion in the first three days alone in pre sale.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:46.920]   It's between that and they're beyond that. You know, they've done that in in recent years,
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.880]   not with all products, but they've done it in recent years. And you know, they don't really need
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.200]   to do it. And this time they they said even before it started that they weren't going to release any
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.800]   numbers. Yeah, they were supply constraint, not demand and strained.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:08.520]   Right. It seems like whatever the number is of people who really want
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:17.000]   iPhones or iPads or watches or whatever, it seems like demand is always everything Apple has and
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.720]   then like 10% more. Like every time because there's always a shipping delay after pre orders go live
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:32.440]   and there's always that couple of weeks or maybe a month before they reach what I think Tim usually
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:38.680]   on the calls will refer to as supply demand balance, where you could walk into a store if you felt
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:44.600]   like it and walk out with a phone. And I think there's there's always going to be that demand.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:53.560]   I mean, for as far as I can see to come, there's always going to be slightly more people who want
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:10:00.200]   iPhones than there are iPhones that exist. But at least in the first wave, is it a lot of the press
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.560]   that Apple's been getting admittedly from a lot of publications that like to write negative things
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.880]   about Apple is about how the curve on phone sales is starting to flatten out that have the iPhone
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:18.040]   contributes this huge Pacman shape wedge of Apple's profits every year. It's a bad thing that
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:25.880]   things are flattening out. Do you think maybe there's any possibility that Apple now wants to
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:31.480]   start to tamp down expectations and not try to tip their hat as to how well or how
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.880]   moderately less than well a sale of a particular phone is going now that the stock prices can
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.960]   tumble based on someone predicting that Apple will sell fewer iPhone sevens than iPhone sixes
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.840]   last year. There was an analyst today that was saying that the global market for phones is dead
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.000]   because it's tapped out at two billion and it's not increasing and now people are still switching
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.640]   from feature to smartphones. But oh, we're all doomed because the smartphone gravy train is over.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.840]   Sorry, the phone gravy train is over. It's beyond iPhone, I think it's just in mobile. You reach
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.080]   certain levels of penetration and in lieu of opening stores on Mars, you're sort of stuck with
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:14.200]   the human audience. It's like a Facebook scale user acquisition problem. Well, Apple could do
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:21.240]   what Wells Fargo didn't just pretend to sell phones to people in nature. Make up people and then
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:27.720]   sell them phones. This is a good plan. Or they could do what Henry Ford did was let's build up a
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.640]   prosperous middle class, make them feel secure so that they will be able to afford to buy our products
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.280]   and then eventually get in debt to buy our products so that they have to keep coming back to their
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:44.200]   jobs working for us. So we could be working towards an all Apple economy.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:51.000]   I'm very, very, very, I was buying by the million in which in which all of us are every
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.480]   American is working for Apple and yet 93 cents of every dollar is still going to Ireland for some
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.520]   reason. Renee, you mentioned earlier that part of the problem of the shortage is the difficulty
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:10.520]   the high reject rate with that jet black phone that that glossy glossy black. It seems as though
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   the simplest paint treatments or surface treatments are the hardest. Oh God. So how's yours? How's yours
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.160]   holding up? So you got one of the good ones. There there've been reports saying that Apple is
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:30.040]   the factory is rebits making these cases and making this the surface are rejecting three or four out of
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.600]   every 10 that they produce right now because they're still figuring out how to do it. But you got
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.840]   oh, you got two good ones. Well, no, so this one is the mat, which is not as shiny, which means it
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.800]   is less desirable for humans because we are captured by shiny things, much like small birds and other
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.440]   mammals. And the shiny one is what get you know, oh bright light bright light must acquire.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:55.000]   I was I was surprised. It's okay, Andy. I just looked at it really hard and now Renee's phone has
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.720]   a scratch. Well, it does much like it really is identical to the well, I mean, the effect is
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.880]   identical to the iPhone 3G or 3GS where you will see fingerprints and you will see scuffs. And as a
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:14.200]   fan of the Warren item Star Wars universe things, I like my millennium Falcon with a few parsecs on
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:20.120]   it. I don't want to pristine prequel spaceship. And I'm the same with my iPhone. My iPhone 3GS
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.960]   took a beating. It was never in a case. And I still love that phone. And this phone, I'm sure, I mean,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.120]   during some of the testing we did for the water resistance, I accidentally missed dropping it in
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.560]   the water and hit the side of the rock. And I'm sure if I look hard enough, I'll see the damage
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.880]   from that. But it's it's an object. It's like I have a leather band on this watch and it's petinaed
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.960]   and it's much darker and it's much more weather than it was when I got it. And I like it all the
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.200]   more because of it. So I understand that people are super concerned about the about that they can
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.760]   get a matte black or they can get a case. But Apple is a really weird company. They just never
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.760]   enough is never enough for them. And they get criticized for being boring. And we've talked about
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.240]   this before. The iPhone 5 was boring because it was still around wrecked, even though every on an
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.600]   atomic level, it was completely redesigned. iPhone 6s, the casing was completely redone for a
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.760]   gasket and for seals and for the 7000 series aluminum. iPhone 7 is completely redone again for the
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.480]   water resistance. And they're atomically redoing it, but they put it in a similar shape. And they
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.040]   could just use a similar finish, but they like life to be difficult. They were constrained on
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.080]   AA processors. So they got two suppliers for the A9. And now they're constrained on this finish
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.160]   because this finishes brand new and they're having a hard time getting yield rates in excess of
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   what is it 60% or something, they'll overcome that. And then they're going to be super ambitious and
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.320]   try to do something hard next year. And they'll be written a display was a huge constraint for the
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.240]   first two generations. There's always the if you want to push, you have to you have to be ready for
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.960]   the pushback. Yep. And that but that's what we expect from from Apple. You know, we expect them
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:55.160]   to do the hard things. And so boring, Jan. They're so I think that the benefits of that for the user
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:02.120]   are are very good. And I think they've been very good for, you know, all generations of the iPhone
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:09.320]   when people look at Apple and say, you know, this this phone should be redesigned because it's boring.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.880]   It's the same old design. I don't think that they're looking at it the right way. First of all,
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.360]   it's a big design mistake to redesign something for the sake of redesigning it.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.880]   And what's interesting is that when Apple does redesign it, then people say, Oh, I like the
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.680]   last one better. Why did they have to redesign it? The S is an iconic classic now. It was like
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.240]   iPhone five was boring, but the S is an iconic my hands have not changed. Human hands haven't
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.080]   changed in a few years and phones have to fit those hands. So I'm guessing they're not going to
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.400]   change for a few years either. My Samsung phones are largely the same. My HTC phones are like,
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.760]   no one's making triangular phones. It's a lost opportunity. The the baklava phone. I would buy it
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:53.960]   if we had that nice honey dipping sauce. There's but there's a there's a point there that I'm not
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.400]   really design minded like a lot of other people are it's I don't I don't fault Apple for making a
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.720]   so-called boring design. Bill Maher really teed off on Apple for some reason during a show,
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:09.240]   I think a couple of days ago, but two days before presidential debate of two of the most hated
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.160]   candidates ever to run for president. And this is what he's got on his mind that there's a luxury
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.680]   phone that it doesn't look interesting enough to me. Okay, fine. But I can't I mean, I can't pretend
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.640]   that I could really see the difference between one rounded rectangle and another. In my position
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.200]   has always been that most people, at least that I see around town, they tend to put their phone
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.960]   inside a case of some sort to make it really personal to themselves. Sometimes I do wonder that
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.840]   there there's thousands and thousands of words being published by Apple about here is everything
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:48.520]   we had to do in order to make a glossy black phone. So it's a really, really tough thing to do. And
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:54.120]   here's how we made this special version of white for this other product. And is this the sort of
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:01.640]   thing that customers are really responding to or do they just say cool, it's black? Oh, I'm sorry,
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:07.560]   it's shiny black. Yeah, my my cousin's got a got a plastic plastic blister pack phone. And it's
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.600]   glossy black too with that's really like glossy black. And they're not getting that no, no, no,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:19.000]   they didn't just get plastic and publish it. It was more complicated. Is on some level as Apple
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.160]   putting a lot of money and a lot of their time and their thought into something that people
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.520]   notice for like five seconds and then sort of disregard or is it deeper than that?
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:33.000]   Anybody can I think I think if you look at just what's happening on Twitter, just what people are
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.880]   saying that you'll see that they do care. They do care. And you know, people are
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:46.040]   agonizing over whether to get glossy black or matte black and you know, they're both so beautiful
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.800]   and what they agonize over this stuff. So it does work for Apple.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:58.440]   Kelly, are we being silly? As a group, are we just most about this or in general?
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.160]   Well, I mean, look at how I grew myself. So with that's the answer to that question,
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.440]   people who are watching this on YouTube. But I mean, it's like, it's like,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.200]   you invited me. So I know there's a certain silliness factor here before I ever showed up.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.760]   Aside from that, I think
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.120]   I think it gives people something to sort of focus on because on the outside, it does look the same.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:29.880]   This is the same sort of tick talk we kind of saw previously. It's just not as big on the
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.800]   revolution track, which is usually what the number change means. You know, from like four to four S
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:42.520]   or three G to three GS when we were when we were doing those, the inside was totally different.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:48.040]   It had way more interesting innards in the S model, but it looked the same on the outside. So a lot
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:54.440]   of people were like, eh, it gets the same phone. I don't really care without understanding, like
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:01.640]   Renee was saying that the inside has been redone at an atomic level. And I think having settled
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.160]   kind of on these phone sizes, which like Renee was saying, you know, hands aren't any different.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.880]   And yet, you know, so like I still have a hard time with my six. I certainly wouldn't want to go
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:18.760]   to a plus because I can't reach anything. So like I have a hard time on my success already. So
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:26.280]   I think it gives people something to focus on. Like last time it was rose gold, you know, do I get
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:33.560]   a pink phone or do I not get a pink phone? And if I get a gold phone, what does that say about me or,
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.040]   you know, people who don't care and are going to put it in a case? Like, I think it sort of gives
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.520]   people something to differentiate about when they're looking to get a new phone without
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:48.200]   necessarily understanding, because not everybody sits to do the Apple events. Not everybody gets
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:55.000]   to watch the super amazing how it's made video that we all get to watch, which is a channel I
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.960]   would pay for is if Apple just released manufacturing videos, I would watch that all day long.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:09.080]   I want to see how Johnny I've butters his toast. First of all, when you when you curl it instead
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:15.560]   of slice it, you expect more fat molecules are exposed and the interaction is sealed.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:23.080]   It's the thinnest lightest bread ever. So like I I'm interested in all that stuff, but I'm not,
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.920]   you know, I think that there are certain things that you sort of have to do cosmetically to get
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.680]   general folks excited about it because a lot of people couldn't tell you anything about the
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.440]   processor and the phone they have now. They may not even be able to tell you how much memory it
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:44.520]   has now, because they don't care. It does everything I want it to do. And I know that it will tell me
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:50.040]   when I've taken too many pictures and I have to delete some. And you know, for some people,
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.120]   like this is a thing that I've noticed a lot because I deal with people on every,
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:01.160]   at every stop on the technological spectrum. I have a family member who got an iPhone called me
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.360]   up really excited to tell me about it. And I said, Well, which one did you get? And she said,
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:13.320]   the green one. And that was all she knew. And so, you know, I have everyone from her to you guys.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:21.000]   And the the reaction that people have at different stops along that spectrum is really interesting.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.040]   And a lot of people are pretty honest about it. You know, it's the same thing I've said about
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.560]   the iPad forever. It makes a good computer upgrade for some people because it does everything that
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.760]   they need it to do. And I think that if you know your phone is going to do everything you need it
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:43.000]   to do because you've had two or three or four, seven iPhones, you have a pretty good idea what
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.280]   you need out of it. And you know that everything that you've had previous to this one has been
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.080]   more than capable. So now when you look at the new one, like the shiny black is the thing that
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:59.640]   will differentiate it. So I think on the one hand, it's not necessarily it's not something that would
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.560]   hang me up because I don't want a black phone in the first place. I like having the white face on
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:10.440]   mine. But otherwise, I think a lot of people are looking for a way to have it stand out and having
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.560]   a shiny one is one way to do that. Yeah, but that's a good point. Before we move on, I'd
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:24.760]   really like to hear Jim and Renee talk about to what extent we've all met lots of people who work
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:31.880]   at Apple at lots of different levels of the manufacturing process. Jim, what do you believe
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:41.240]   that the big reason for doing these? I'm sorry, but the reason there was there was hearing ghosts.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.840]   Jim, do you think that there's a big reason why the big reason why they do all these special
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.720]   treatments is it could be because they think they want to make a beautiful product that will last
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:56.600]   the next two years, or is it just they want to make people so interested, so enraptured by our
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:03.240]   Godzilla section of our brains about who shiny, who glossy, just like a Porsche or something.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.200]   Just to get people to buy that phone instead of waiting another year for whatever is coming up
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:14.760]   next. I don't think any company would do the types of things that Apple's doing with metal
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:22.040]   metals, just so the people could upgrade. I think they do it because they feel that they can make
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:30.040]   a better product. I mean, you don't invent new manufacturing techniques for a tiny bevel
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:36.680]   just so that people will say, "Oh, I have to have it because of that bevel." No, it's about the whole
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:43.560]   experience on the hardware. It's about how you hold it and how it feels in your hand. Those are all
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:51.560]   things that Apple considers to be part of the experience. When people look at the phone,
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:59.000]   it looks beautiful because of that tiny millimeter diamond cut that they had to make and come up with
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.280]   new tools and new manufacturing in order to do it. I think everything that they do in hardware
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:14.600]   is all about making sure that people have the best product that they can. I think that they
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:21.320]   make those decisions, hard decisions, for that reason and that reason only.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:26.680]   Renee, sometimes I worry that a lot of these decisions are things that Apple,
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:33.240]   decisions that Apple makes because I believe that they just organically enjoy the process of design
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:38.520]   and manufacturing and that they don't want to make a phone that bores them and they have an
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.080]   insight into it really is about how can we get that mill chamfer edge, how can we bring that edge
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.960]   of the edge of the display as close to the edge of the case as possible, what do we have to invent
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:54.440]   in order to make this all come together? Am I totally off base? Is there sometimes a difference
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:00.040]   between things that Apple does because they just enjoy the process versus things they do because
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.840]   they know that customers are going to enjoy the final product?
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.400]   I think there's a couple layers to that and I think certainly you have someone like Johnny
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.760]   Ive who's won more Black Pencil Awards than most companies. Most in many industries have won
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.440]   and when you have someone like that the worst thing that can happen is for them to get bored
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.280]   because that's when they stop being productive. To some extent, Johnny Ive's ability to play
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.840]   with materials and finishes and manufacturing techniques is what keeps him alive and excited
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.320]   at Apple. Conversely, we always hear this line about only Apple and I think the company has a
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.520]   huge point of pride in that. I know the popular narrative now especially amongst tech pundits
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.800]   is like Samsung is manufacturing as good as if not better than Apple but that's frankly garbage.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.720]   They make a nice phone but when you see that Apple actually builds the machines that build
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:49.720]   the machines that make these phones, they are ridiculously ahead. They operate almost in the
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.600]   future. Now you might choose like they're aesthetic and that's fine or that the build qualities are
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.480]   good. That's great but just in terms of pure manufacturing porn, you can sit and watch those
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.840]   videos. Kelly was talking about and be amazed. They are literally pushing the state of this
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:10.040]   industry so far so fast that when they do something like a chamfered edge, it is only Apple that
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.920]   year that can do it. Two years later everybody is doing chamfered edges. We're about to get new
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.000]   Google Pixel phones. That for all intents and purposes look like the iPhone 6 but two or three
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.880]   years after the iPhone 6 shipped and that's when the technology disseminates. You hear people
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:32.200]   saying Apple is doing a Goldphone O, Kim Cardassian, roll their eyes and they make fun of it on Conan
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.920]   O'Brien but then when they can't get it at the store, why can't I get the gold iPhone or this
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.800]   year? Why can't I get the Jet Black one? To quote Jot Sweden when you scratch our surface,
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.640]   you really do find more surface and we like people to know that we have the new iPhone and Apple
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:53.240]   is hugely cognizant about that. It's why they do the new colors in the off new design years because
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.880]   we care almost as much about having the new colors. We do have the new form factor and I think all
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:05.480]   three of those things sort of play together. I do think we can be silly though. It's cute when
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:12.360]   you have a four-year-old child who just wants to walk into the middle of the park and just spin
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.600]   and spin and spin and it really is adorable but then when the kid is still doing it when they're
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:23.560]   14 or 14, it's like, "Okay, moving on." I'll go ahead, Jim.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:31.080]   For myself, it doesn't matter at all that I have the new color or anything. I mean, I don't care
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.440]   and I don't care if anybody knows. Some people do.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:43.800]   Well, if we're going to be bragging, I have the Craig 4504 floating point calculator.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:52.520]   All right, you win. You win. Stick on this one, baby. But speaking of being silly,
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:28:00.200]   there's a funny story about the iPhone 7 or people doing stupid things, the iPhone 7 that swept
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:08.120]   everywhere and now became a controversy because basically a Ukrainian YouTuber who actually lives
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:14.600]   in Sacramento, Taras Masumik, who quote, "specializes in smashing technology for your
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:21.560]   pleasure." Yes, it is a it is a snuff porn channel. It made a funny video in which he
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:26.760]   posi-- he said that, "Oh, well, actually instead of removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7,
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.720]   they just like, they just like, you know, spackled it over with the case because it'd be too expensive."
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:37.080]   And if you actually like drill, drill through this section of the case, you will actually now
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:43.480]   be able to access the port that has been hidden and resulting supposedly in at least a couple
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.440]   dozen people saying, "Hey, I drilled through it just where you said and all it did was crack the screen.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:56.920]   What's up, man?" Now, and of course, the second part of the news cycle is this can't. This must
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.360]   be people on Reddit, like, or and YouTube commenters just having some fun and saying, "Oh, yeah, boy.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.160]   My dad's going to be so mad because it's his phone. I thought I was doing a nice thing."
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:13.400]   Kelly, do you think people are that stupid and people are actually doing that to their brand new
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.320]   barely were able to get one phone?
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:20.600]   I hope the answer is no. I expect the answer is yes.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:27.000]   I want it not to be true. I want it to be something where, like, Reddit
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.640]   sticked a bunch of people on this video because they thought it would be funny to have a comment
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:39.240]   section, you know, that looks like that. But I have also taken-- because I do tech support most
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:45.480]   of the time, and I spend a lot of time talking to a lot of people about a lot of different things
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.800]   technologically. I've been doing tech support for lots of different companies over the years.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:56.280]   In so doing, I have talked to people who really would believe something like that
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:01.800]   and might actually try it. And the reason that I want it not to be true is because I want people
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.400]   to stop and think because a lot of folks, you know, are not on the two-year subsidy program or
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.840]   the three-year subsidy program anymore with their phone. They're buying them outright.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:17.640]   So do you really want to take a drill to something that's six or seven or eight or nine hundred dollars
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:23.880]   if it all goes terribly wrong? And I kind of want to know what jobs these people have where they're
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.760]   like, well, if it doesn't work, I guess I'm just out six hundred bucks or nine hundred bucks or
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:35.560]   whatever, because that seems like a whole lot of money to me, even still. I'm really--
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.120]   I'm more interested. If it's legit, I'm interested in the demographics of those people.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.160]   That it's totally fine to take a power tool to a piece of technology like that.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:51.880]   I'm with Kelly. I can't imagine that somebody would do that, but then again, I think they would.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.320]   It's the third year in the row, right? Like they've had these prank videos. One was throw the iPhone
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.480]   six in the pool because it's now water resistant and people ruined their phones. I forget what it
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.840]   was last year, but it was something equally phone-destroying. And now-- I think it was.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:10.120]   There's a new charging mechanism where if you just put it in the microwave by radio-based
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.000]   with charge of battery. And three years in a row, congratulations. You've ruined people's
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.760]   iPhones. I hope the lawsuits come fast and furious. I'm going to say that I believe that people were
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:25.960]   actually doing this, and I have a very personal reason why. I had the experience of writing an
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.280]   April Fool's article for the Boston Appear Society, McIntars User Group newsletter,
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:36.120]   in which I thought that, well, the only way I can get away with this is if it's-- I make up something
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:42.120]   so absurd that nobody is going to believe this is real. So I wrote an article about how Apple was
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:46.520]   recalling all the original. This is like when the Mac SE had just came come out. So Apple's
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:52.120]   recalling all the original Mac 128 because it's a fire hazard. And then I explained like the nature
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:58.520]   of the fire hazard and this Rube Goldberg cascade of failures that ended with-- and this is almost a
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:04.760]   direct quote-- the electron gun of the CRT, reversing polarity and firing backwards into the back of
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.440]   the case and trying to erase the names of all of the Mac team that had quit or been fired
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:16.040]   since-- in the three years since the back 120 had been released. And because of the heat buildup
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.600]   resulting, the gasoline soaked rags that had been installed under the motherboard as a vapor
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:28.200]   barrier catch fire, therefore igniting the device. And before long, we got dozens-- close to 500
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.160]   people who were upset or at least had like contacted say, "I called my Apple dealer about
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:40.280]   trying to get the tag that you said that you're supposed to have them send you so you-- I could
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.080]   send this back and get-- I also said that if you send back the Mac 128, they would send you a fully
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:52.840]   loaded Mac SE to thank you for jeopardizing their lives. And I got a call-- that was my first
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:33:00.440]   official interaction with Apple, which they very much wanted to meet the young man who had
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:06.680]   decided to defame their product thusly. And so, yes, I believe that in any statistically
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.640]   significant sample pool, there are people who are that foolish to think, "Whoa, Golly,
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:17.000]   this-- I was upset about no headphone jack, but now I was foolish to ever doubt it.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:25.560]   Where's the DeWaltz stew? I'll do your phone as well." Maybe there's some crackers there and jeez.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.760]   Did you think twice about doing anything like that again?
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:35.720]   I did indeed. And the sad thing was I was the person who was like telling the editor,
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.040]   "Oh, come on. Let's just go ahead with it because they're never going to believe this.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.680]   There's just going to be a good laugh." And then I had to-- yeah, I had to be the one who was
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.560]   dealing with all the blowback. We didn't lose any advertisers, but there were the Boston
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.440]   Computer Society, Mackintosh user group, had a great amount of autonomy because we were the only
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.480]   part of the organization that was consistently bringing in huge numbers of members and money.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:05.480]   So long as we didn't cause Boston Pure Society Central to get any calls, and they got some calls.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.360]   So now I will--
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.320]   I'm just curious, is your fault, Andy? That's all I heard from that entire story.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:22.040]   Oh, it is. It is. It's like-- also, I think that anybody who has done tech support and has seen
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.480]   exactly what people who are unfamiliar with technology think is the right thing to do to a
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:35.640]   good God-fearing computer that never harmed anybody or caused harm to come to another human
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:42.200]   being and doing so committed to its programming, the best disability, and didn't realize that someone
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.720]   is going to fold sheets of paper and jam it through the disk slot because they wanted that paper to
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:53.000]   be printed and no, that was actually-- Wasn't there that classic line of the 10 best Dell support
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.240]   calls of one was like, "My coffee mug holder fell off. I kept pressing eject. It would come out.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.640]   I put my coffee cup on it and then it broke off." It was a whole bunch like that.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.520]   I don't know what kind it is, but it says 24x. Yeah.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.680]   It says, "Press any key to continue. There is no any key on my keyboard. What kind of garbage
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:14.440]   are you selling?" Yeah. It's hard to invent a joke that has not actually occurred to somebody
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:20.360]   at 2 AM who is thinking, "I really am going to go back to college and I'm going to finish that
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:27.480]   polyside degree because I don't like the real world. It's a bad place." But sometimes justice
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:37.080]   is served. I do have to point out that I might have mentioned-- I wore the mask quite well
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.800]   about my disappointment with the deletion of the headphone jack. I decided to take the higher road
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.720]   and just simply case a Ross Iran. I make a big deal out of it. I've gotten letters praising people,
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.600]   praising me, saying that my level of decorum and not mentioning it more than once or twice over the
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:59.320]   past couple of years was-- I'm drilling any holes. I saw Trump's post debate talk and I realized
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:04.760]   that I like his form. I like just simply going ahead and saying what I hope people will believe
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.640]   about me. But I am-- because I'm an imperfect vessel for the perfection of the universe,
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:17.000]   I cannot help but gloat. And when I read that in the first couple of weeks of iOS 10 and the new
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.320]   iPhones, a lot of people were having problems getting their new thunderbolt earbuds to actually
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   stay working. There was a bug in the OS that would cause the sound to keep on going, but all of the
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.840]   controls, the Siri button, the volume, to just die and force them to unplug and plug back in.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:43.560]   Apple did fix it with a OS update. So supposedly that has been fixed. But it does underscore
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:50.600]   what was my big issue in that you plug in a simple two-conductor headphone in. It works. And
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:55.560]   if you have a lightning thing as well as it's engineered, it works if the software that makes
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:02.680]   it work works. And if nothing changes to make that software stop working. So have we learned a lesson?
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:08.680]   Or is this just a regular bump in the road? I'm going to call on Renee because Renee has always
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.040]   put me in my place very hand-
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:17.640]   >> No, not at all. I deserve it. I deserve it. I'm just addicted to these inexpensive,
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:23.960]   affordable, simple-- I'm from a simple Puritan fishing colony called Boston, Massachusetts.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.560]   We drag our nets, we bring in the cats of the day.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:32.760]   >> Yeah, we go on music. We play to an angry and indifferent God. We dance, we kiss our
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:38.200]   children, we go to bed early and stay the other day. We're not like you fancy Canadian city folks.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.600]   >> Do the thing is, Jamie, what's the popcorn?
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.040]   >> That's really about this is lightning earphones are the first thing to make people
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:49.080]   forget about core audio. Because for years, I have had problems with 3.5 millimeter headphone
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.560]   jacks. And the human mind is terrible. We remember current pain acutely and past pain we kind of
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.720]   forget about. Otherwise, we'd never touch technology again. But you'd plug the lightning
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.560]   phone into your Mac or into your iPhone. You wouldn't get the audio out of them. You'd pull it out,
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.720]   you'd put it back in. You'd Google it, say, sometimes it loses track of the state. So just
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.480]   push it back in, pull it back out again. Try that a few times. Then you reboot and suddenly
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.160]   core audio decides that it remembers that it has a headphone jack and starts playing again.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.320]   So I never know, like, is this new technology? Is this just exposing one more crack in core
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.880]   audio? It's carefully shellacked, veneer? Or is this just the fact that whatever you plug into a
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.720]   device is at some point not going to work and they'll fix it as best they can and move on.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.160]   Until the next time it doesn't work. And I know as a nihilistic point of view, but I mean,
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:34.520]   that's sort of what technology has reduced me to over these years. So this may not have happened
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.000]   if we had 3.5 millimeter headphones still. But I'm willing to bet at some point core audio would
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.320]   have done this to me again anyway. >> So Renee, if I can summarize what you've just said,
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:49.720]   have you just said that the stability and design excellence of any iPhone technology is a
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.520]   molecularly thin veneer that cracks when exposed to sunlight? >> I think what I said.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.200]   >> I think that's what you said. That's fine. Kelly, you want to say something?
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:04.120]   >> Yeah, I think there's a really simple reason why headphone jack went away. And I don't, I think
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:13.880]   partly it was we need the space for battery, camera sensor, memory. Because the thing, if they
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:21.880]   had said there's no more 16 gigabyte iPhone because we took the headphone jack space and now everything
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:28.440]   starts at 32, you're welcome. They'd have inhaled as the conquering hero. And I think there's a very
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.680]   simple reason why the headphone jack went away. Where does a raised phone live in their pocket?
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.920]   Even if you don't keep anything else in the same pocket as your iPhone, what else is in your pocket?
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:45.240]   Lent. How many hours and hours and hours of genius bar appointments have been,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:51.560]   have been resolved because somebody had that pair of tweezers from iFixit that you can use to
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:56.200]   get all the grody Lent and everything else out of the headphone jack so people can use their headphones
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:03.400]   again. >> Jimmy, you know more about headphones than I ever will. How do you think, and you've
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:08.200]   talked to a lot of real musicians, but I talked to musicians who've been dead for 40 years, who
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:13.560]   killed themselves because their careers went nowhere. How well do you think that the transition
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:18.360]   is working and how was the alternatives holding up to your point of view?
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:24.120]   >> So you want me to talk about headphone in general or the fact that there was problems with
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.840]   this one working? >> Well, both things. I mean, you're dealing with an analog to digital converter
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:34.040]   inside the cord. You're dealing with software that has to make it run. I realized that I have
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:41.720]   my limitations because I am the person who basically will have four pairs of $12 or free with a phone,
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:46.760]   headphones around the house. I'll just grab the nearest pair. And when I want high fidelity,
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:53.400]   I go to my home stereo and not to my headphones. So I'm not every user and I'm just a very practical
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.480]   person who misses the simplicity. But as someone who knows what they're talking about when it comes to
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:03.160]   getting fine audio inside of your ear canals, how well is this transition working? And is it still,
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:09.480]   if you put aside all of the apple-centric reasons for the switch, is everything going to turn out
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:15.320]   okay for everybody? >> Okay, so let's talk about the fact that there were problems with the
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:22.600]   lightning connector first. Is that a bad thing? Well, yeah, it shouldn't have happened. But
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:32.440]   it's a software bug. The remote part of the Apple headphones stop working when you plug it in and
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:40.040]   certain things happen. It goes to sleep. It's not the end of the world.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:49.480]   Nobody wants a software bug to come out in their new phone and OS. But it did happen and they'll
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:56.520]   fix it and it'll go away. I don't see that as a huge deal. It's an annoying thing that you
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:02.840]   wish hadn't have happened. Not because of Apple, but you wish it hadn't happened as a user because
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:12.280]   it's frustrating from a user perspective. The headphone jack. So I have maintained all along
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:19.320]   that I could care less if Apple gets rid of the headphone jack or not. Now, when I said that,
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:26.040]   people said, "Well, clearly you don't have a decent set of headphones," or you would care.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:35.800]   I have the headphones that I use on a daily basis are future Sonics. They're the best headphones
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:44.840]   in the world and my in-ear headphones. They're molded to my ears, custom made. The guy who invented
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:51.960]   in-ear headphones made my headphones. He started future Sonics as a company.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:57.080]   So yes, I do have a good set of headphones. Yes, I do care about
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:10.120]   good audio quality in my ears. When I look at what would I buy if I was going to go out and buy
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:16.600]   a new set of headphones today, I would march right down to future Sonics to Marty and buy
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:24.760]   another set of those. They are so good. Now, when I was talking before about the headphone jack
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:31.560]   being eliminated, I also made a point to say I believe that Apple will include an adapter in
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:39.480]   the box and they will include a new set of headphones that work with lightning. So everything is going
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.880]   to be great. There's not going to be any problem. You'll have a new set of headphones to you. So
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:51.560]   when people were talking about the fact that Apple wasn't going to have headphones, I'll tell you
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   what in discussions that I had with people, I'll tell you what they thought. They thought that
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.080]   meant that they weren't going to be able to listen to music on their iPhone anymore.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:09.320]   That there was no way to listen to music. The way that certain sites framed this whole discussion
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:17.000]   was Apple was taking away the headphone jack. People were upset because, well,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.800]   how am I going to listen to music? When I said, "But there's still going to be a jack,"
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.680]   and Apple will give you a free set of headphones to use in that jack and they said,
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:34.120]   "Oh, well, what's the big deal then?" Exactly. The majority of people,
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:42.600]   99% of consumers do not care about the headphone jack. They just want to be able to listen to music
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:48.760]   and the conversation was framed in a way, I think, on purpose against Apple
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:54.920]   because they were getting rid of the headphone jack, making people believe that they weren't
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:01.400]   going to be able to listen to music anymore on their iPhones. Now, I also told the people,
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:09.080]   if you have an existing set of headphones that you really like, if you can't get anything better
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:15.480]   and you buy a set of Beats headphones, yeah, I don't like Beats headphones.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:21.240]   You're at a store that sells Beats headphones and a banana and you don't like the fit of the
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.680]   banana on your ear, so you go for the Beats headphones, yes.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:30.840]   If you have a set of headphones that you really like, if you're like Marco Arman,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:37.960]   you know, Marco knows his headphones. I think Marco is like one third gazelle or something.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.200]   He has a sense of hearing that I didn't even have before I saw my first rock concert.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:48.120]   I know. So, you know, I have a lot of respect for Marco's opinion. So, if you're like that,
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:53.000]   Apple is going to include an adapter in the box so you can plug that in and use your
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:01.560]   existing headphones. And honestly, everybody that I talk to said then I don't get what everybody's
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:12.200]   yelling about. Now, there is that 1%, maybe 2% of people that, you know, are such audio files and
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:20.840]   have the absolute top of the line best headphones of everything on their iPhone, they want
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:29.800]   you know, those headphones to be used. But I'd have to argue that true audio files probably
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:36.200]   aren't going to listen to their top of the line headphones music on an iPhone. You know,
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.920]   they're going to have the stereo system at home and they're going to do that. Most people don't
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:47.800]   care if you walk down any street, you see the white headphones. And those audio files were even
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.600]   more upset was a two generations ago when Apple took the tubes out of the iPhone 4. I think it
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:58.600]   was. So you can't get quarter inch Jack. You can't please everybody. Before we get off
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:03.880]   headphones though, I do have to ask you one question that I've tried everything that Apple
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:09.480]   released except for the AirPods. So you and I have one thing in common in that sense of
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:16.840]   signature, if not my my my sideburns aren't as majestic as your beard. Can you wear the AirPods
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:22.040]   and AirPods and your beard does not interfere with in any way, still microphones still pick up
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:28.040]   and the you don't get any rustling from the from the well or even let's let's also acknowledge
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:33.800]   any electric or magnetic interference from the sexual charge that gets thrown off from your beard
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:44.200]   in all directions. I won't comment on the last part of that but the AirPods actually work and fit
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:51.720]   a lot better than I thought that they would. And I'm as surprised about that as anybody because
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:59.080]   the AirPods, the wired headphones that Apple gives you, don't exactly fit me very good. I mean,
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:05.320]   they work themselves out a little bit and you can feel when you push it back in all of a sudden
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:13.400]   you can hear music in that air again. Some people have a really difficult time with the headphones
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:18.360]   just not fitting at all but it's the set of headphones you can't try and fit everybody's ear.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:27.240]   They did fit mine for the most part. Now when I tried the AirPods, they actually fit a lot better
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:36.440]   and I think it's because the wires do put some drag on the headphones and that tends to pull
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:44.280]   on the headpiece, the earpiece a little bit which loosens them. Now in my time with the AirPods and
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:50.920]   I got them the day after the keynote I think. I got them from Apple the day after the keynote
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:58.360]   and I've been wearing them a lot to test them out and people, I mean this is Twitter for you.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:03.160]   People were saying I don't understand why Apple did this, they're going to fall out of your ears
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:07.640]   and you'll never keep them in and they were saying this to me and I said, "Have you used them?" No.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:17.640]   But they'll fall out. Well no, they won't. I have them. I do my exercise with them. I go on my walk
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.840]   just to prove a point. I actually ran and nobody was chasing me.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:28.200]   I don't believe it. That's different. Okay. Okay. No, I believe no.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.240]   Is there a beer truck in front of you, sir? Exactly. Were you chasing a beer truck?
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.760]   Was there a green vehicle in front of you, let's say?
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.840]   A Heineken with a bell. Ding, ding, ding, ding, and Jim's out.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.920]   $20. Mr. Heineken, man. Mr. Beer, man.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:47.000]   Give me a push draft and a sprinkle logger and my mom wants. I'm sorry.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.920]   I will say that I'm going to have them try them myself yet so I can't speak first. I've been
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.160]   very impressed with all the people who have had them and of course the first thing they do is
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:03.080]   try to shake them out of their ears and I think I really honestly think that the leading cause of
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:09.800]   concussion amongst tech journalists is going to be all of the pogoing and heavy metal headbagging
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:15.000]   they are doing trying to dislodge this thing. There was that famous post from that fellow who
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:25.560]   maybe due to excess earwax or ear canal was using a popular plumbing fixture in the house
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:32.440]   and suddenly did not want to have one of his earbuds back again. But that's going to happen.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:37.400]   I just lost the wire. I have a wired in ear and the ear pods and I just looked my head and
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.880]   the wired one fell out first. So I don't know what's real anymore. Again, maybe you should
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:45.720]   clean that other ear. There are there are kids who buy on Amazon that just like a little squirt
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.800]   squirt gun. Jim is right though. Like the lack of the cord is like the regular ear pods don't
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.640]   stay in my ears for more than a few seconds. But these stay I've been walking and running with them
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.320]   every day and I've had them fall out once I think when I actually stopped and tried to shake
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.640]   something off my head. But they've been way better than the regular ear. We're trying to shake
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:07.800]   Andy off. No, it was like a mosquito or something because I was in the woods and I just instant
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:12.440]   fear of vampirism. So I just shook it off quickly and ran but picked it up, put it back in kept
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:18.280]   going. I think people are going to be really impressed when they actually get to use them. And
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:23.880]   then other people were saying that, well, you're going to lose them all the time. Well, no, I don't
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:29.240]   think you will lose them all the time. $160. I'm very good at not losing things that cost people.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:35.480]   I mean, maybe a kid would lose them all the time and maybe you will lose them on the earphone
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:41.800]   one time. But I'm not I'm not a child. I can keep track of my headphones. And if I don't keep track
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   of my headphones, then I'm going to have to go buy a new set. And then I definitely will keep
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.560]   tracking my headphones. I just hope that will sell to the place. I like the links for the watch.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:57.560]   I have a single key from my place. And I don't lose my key. The headphones are the same size as my
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:02.600]   key. I don't lose it. I've been carrying it around for a couple years and I don't lose it.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:12.120]   So, you know, I don't. It'll work out. I mean, I did. I do believe the stuff that I was saying
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:17.320]   that I don't I don't think that that was the best. It was the best choice for Apple to make
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:23.000]   for my personal point of view. But things change, you adapt, you move on. And I will say that I got
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:30.600]   a Twitter follower who was also a reader. I want to tell me about how he never considered Bluetooth
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.440]   headphones because he thought they all stank. And the last time he tried Bluetooth headphones,
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:40.280]   even like the non special Apple kind was like five or six years ago. And now he's bought a $350
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:44.600]   pair of like almost top of the line bows. And he doesn't he doesn't want to take them off. He
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.840]   loves them so much. So sometimes you do need to have the rug pulled out from under you to realize
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.640]   that to take a look and start to question things that you thought that you understood. But
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.520]   the world changed while you weren't looking at this thing.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:03.880]   And I agree. I agree with that that reader that I tried Bluetooth headsets in the past and they
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:09.560]   were awful. They were, you know, either the fit was bad or the sound quality was bad. They were
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:16.200]   really tinny. And you won't find that now I have to make the point that for those audio files
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:22.440]   that are out there, will the AirPod sound as good as my future Sonics? Never. They never will.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:28.920]   But I wouldn't expect them to. You know, it's designed for a different market. So, you know,
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:35.960]   if what you're looking for is that pristine quality of sound, then you go to something like
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:42.440]   future Sonics. If you want the convenience and the, you know, the knowledge everybody can see that
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:47.960]   you have these white headphones, then yeah, that's what you get. Yeah. Well, we'd be curious to see
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:52.120]   how the AirPods perform for someone like me, because obviously I have a slightly different
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:56.840]   hairstyle than Johnny I've does. And I'd like to know if my hair is going to brush against those,
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.640]   you know, because I have one, that means I have a different hairstyle than Johnny I've, right?
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:07.720]   I would be curious for women what it's like if you have your hair down and you're using
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:13.240]   your AirPods and you take a call, what that sounds like. Great. Now I'm going to have to go get a wig.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:18.600]   You don't have a Gene Simmons wig already. I thought for sure you had a couple from Halloween.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:23.960]   And now I got to go get a wig. I'd be surprised if you don't have one of Gene Simmons personal
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.320]   stage wigs. Complete with the hat.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:33.080]   You're going to knock in a minute and just be like, yo, Jim, I say I'm back breaking, go and just
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:38.360]   hand in one. You'll hand in the slash, love the cigarette, the air pod, the guitar, and he'll
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:43.640]   test it for you, Jim. Well, if that happens, I'm going to have to cut out it early. I'm sorry.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:49.480]   Slash would be an honest to God, real world test. I've gone to slash a couple years for Halloween.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:53.960]   It would be that who I want to know. Do they work for him?
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:59.960]   Well, that's the damn shame of it, because that's the sort of input we really need. But he is the
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:05.240]   sort of person that Apple marketing will not give a free pair of AirPods to because with that long
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:10.920]   hair, nobody's going to see this influential person wearing the product. So it's kind of wasted funds.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.800]   We really do need to go to we really need to go to add right now.
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:23.720]   So fortunately, fortunately, we heard this is why I I I I miss Leo, but I love it when we have like
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:29.880]   other people on where it really is. It really is like, you know, mom and dad are away. We're
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:33.320]   going to drive the Porsche, even though we're not supposed to, we're going to have the house party
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:37.800]   because we're pretty sure we can killing the place up before they get back from Paris.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:43.400]   But we do really do have to go to commercial right now. Fortunately, before dad left,
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:48.920]   he he stock the fridge with pre recorded ad reads, which we will now just put one of them in the
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:54.360]   microwave and put it on high for four minutes. Leo, we'll be right back to Mac break weekly.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.440]   And just a bit, but I want to tell you about Squarespace, the place to make your new website,
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.960]   love Squarespace. That's where my blog is Leo, the port.com. Lisa put our new business up there,
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:11.080]   artisanal agency.com. You know, she did a smart thing. She Squarespace is such a great platform,
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.600]   both the best hosting and the best software together. But there are a lot of Squarespace
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:18.680]   developers. They have a whole directory of developers in every price range. She found a
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:24.600]   developer. She could afford that did a great job and set up a site that was unique, specific to her
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:29.720]   desires. And then he'll maintain it on a regular basis. It's just, it's one of the many reasons
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.920]   Squarespace is a great place to create your website. They have some beautiful templates.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:40.200]   And all the Squarespace templates combine the best engineering, everything from mobile responsive
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:47.080]   design. So one site works on all size screens to e-commerce. Every site has e-commerce built right
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.720]   in. In fact, it's the only platform that gives you a kind of commerce that matches the look and
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:56.840]   feel of your site. It's all part of your template. But they also have templates for a variety of
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:01.240]   uses. As I mentioned at the beginning of the show, if you've got a wedding coming up or a special
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:06.840]   event, maybe a birth, great place to make a website and choose a template that's, you know, looks just
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:12.040]   like you want it. Put your pictures in there. They have site templates that give you what we call
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:18.360]   full bleed. The images fill the screen. They look gorgeous. And they work even on a smartphone
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:23.560]   to a 50 inch display. They just, they just work beautifully. They've got a new magazine style
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:27.960]   templates, which are really cool grid style landing pages. You know, all like the Verge and these
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:34.440]   other, you know, state of the new Yahoo verticals, all these grid style pages with the infinite scroll.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:40.840]   You could do that so easily with Squarespace. I hate to think with the Verge and Yahoo paid
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:45.000]   to get that engineering. You get it as part of your Squarespace, a very affordable Squarespace
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.760]   account. There's a related posts, a thing at the bottom. So it makes it easy for your viewers,
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.880]   your readers to find more stuff on your site, author profiles and integrated search rate at the
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:01.320]   top of the page. They can find your content. It is exactly what you're looking for. And it's been
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:05.880]   done by the best designers and the best engineers in the business. I want you to try Squarespace.

[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:28.120]   registrar. So you could buy domain names there. And I'll tell you why you would want to do that.

[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:11.800]   They've been with us a long time now. We're just big fans. But we now must continue on with MAC
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.960]   break weekly. Gentlemen, guys, never believe it. I was driving the Porsche really carefully.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.320]   Like you said, I was going to, but then I didn't set the parking brake and I fell into the lake.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.240]   And the guy says, going to take a $62,000 in order to fix it. We only got four days. What are we going
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.440]   to do? Man, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:32.120]   and I don't look half as good sliding across the living room in my inner pants as a young Tom
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.040]   Cruz does. Now what nobody does, you look at least two thirds as good. And you don't sell
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:40.520]   yourself short. It's worse two thirds though. It's mostly internal organs. But thank you.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:47.880]   You're very with that out. I did want to before we move off of iOS and the iPhone for good.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:53.560]   One fun thing happened. One that people couldn't figure out one feature that was demonstrated
[00:59:53.560 --> 01:00:00.440]   during the launch event. And that is the wonderful fake bokeh effect of the portrait mode shooting
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:05.560]   that you get with the two lenses. However, the beta of the next version of iOS that includes
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.760]   that feature was released. And so we've been seeing in lots of people's Instagrams.
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:15.080]   Never have so many people I know been so interested in photographing things that are near to them
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:20.120]   in front of something that is very far away. You've been shooting a lot of this stuff. What do you
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.160]   think of the feature so far? Well, first of all, I loved all the early hands on where people like
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:29.480]   me just couldn't find another human being to try it on and had to get the videos up immediately.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:35.400]   So it was like my BB eight or this the spoon that I had lying around or this, you know, action figure
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.160]   because that's what that's a look behind the curtain of how tech blockers actually spend their
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.560]   days. But no, I mean, it's super interesting right now because it is in beta and what it's
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:49.320]   basically doing is using a 28 millimeter wide angle lens to pull in picture data. And then the
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:54.520]   other lens telephoto lens quote unquote to pull out depth data and then it's trying to build a
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.720]   3D depth map from that and apply a Gaussian blur. It's not doing a lens blur because that's too
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:04.840]   computationally expensive. And the Gaussian blur right now is pegging the a 10 processor like it
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.640]   gets hot when it's trying to do this at least on the beta. And then it's trying to do all this
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:15.160]   intelligence to figure out nine different layers. In fact, of of distance and apply
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:20.520]   selectively the different amounts of blur to each of those layers. So it's it's designed for faces,
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.920]   you'll see facial recognition fire when the mode is engaged. And if you have people on it'll lock
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.880]   onto one or two or or several people. And that's really what it's optimized for right now. It'll
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.960]   do other stuff like that flower was an attempt there. It still has a lot of problems. I'm sorry,
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:38.120]   Jim with with beer glasses and other beverages, because there's a lot of reflection. Anything
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:43.160]   with reflection will give it fits right now. A lot of people have a problem with beer glasses too,
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:48.120]   if you know what I mean. But no, totally fair. But I mean, like it is a totally like that was
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.800]   my attempt to take a selfie of it there as well. And you have to hold it around because it doesn't
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:57.000]   work on the front facing camera. Of course, only the rear facing camera. But I love that we're in
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.920]   one of these eras. It's like the original Apple watch as many shortcomings as it had. It was one
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:05.080]   of those exciting new parts of technology where people are trying and experimenting with it.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.000]   And it's different than what the Honor 8 does because it has a black and white camera and
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.640]   they're further apart. It's something uniquely Apple again controlling the whole software stack
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.120]   all the way from the camera sensor to the image signal processor to the camera app.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:22.840]   In here this photo that if you were watching the video now, you can see it on my Instagram feed.
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:27.160]   There were so many reflections on the iPhone that it was absolutely giving fits to the image
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:33.480]   detection. But you can preview it and move things around. But for a beta, you know, the first iteration
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:37.640]   of it, I thought it was great. And we're doing a bunch of product shots with it now that we
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.880]   just wouldn't have been able to do with a smartphone camera before. So I'm looking forward to seeing
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:47.800]   how it doesn't release. Jim, you've been playing with it? I have been. And you know,
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:55.240]   what's interesting about the camera for me on the iPhone is that I suck at photography.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:03.160]   But I take a lot of pictures. So I'm one of these people that the iPhone camera is
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:10.040]   designed for. You know, Apple may not be able to satisfy me in music, but for the camera, they do.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:15.720]   And I've actually told them that anything that you can do to help me take a better photo
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:21.560]   is appreciated. I really do appreciate it because I can't take a decent photo. So
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:32.680]   things like the depth effect or the blur of the background actually makes my photos pop a bit
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:41.480]   more. And you know, I'm sitting there, I'm delighted with them. So I do enjoy it. I do enjoy taking photos.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:49.960]   And unlike you, Andy, you take cameras and you know, you can sit down and take some great shots.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:57.480]   I can't. Giving me your camera, I might as well just throw it in the ground and put it in the
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:04.840]   garbage or something because I feel more comfortable with my iPhone. So being able to take a better
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:11.720]   shot is is perfect. And the depth effect does do that. And just just to add one more thing to the
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.320]   now that we're talking about camera, I have one more thing to the headphone jack.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:22.120]   Without removing the headphone jack, Apple wouldn't have been able to put in a larger battery. They
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:27.400]   wouldn't have been able to put in optical image stabilization. And there are other technologies
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:34.440]   that are going to come that we're talking millimeters that Apple has to work with inside the case of
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:41.800]   the iPhone. I would rather that they move on from a technology that was embedded a hundred years ago.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:51.720]   And and I think that the the smaller headphone jack was actually done in 1964 maybe. So you know,
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.680]   still long time, I'd rather them move on and put new technologies in the phone. And there I'm done
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:05.320]   with headphone jack. Do you have the new iPhone yet? I don't. So I'm I do not have a success.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:17.000]   Excited about it now, actually, is iOS 10 because a lot more people are spending time with the 3D
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.320]   touch and the four such interaction and sort of making everything on your phone right clickable.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:30.280]   And for me, that's been fantastic. And the raise to wake is also something that's very, very cool.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   Whenever I've delayed on getting a new phone, there's always a couple of things in the new
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:42.760]   version of iOS that makes that not quite so bad to have to wait. And those are the two things
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:49.880]   that I've really enjoyed is the new unlocking method. And then lots of people going, oh, hey,
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:54.680]   3D touch that's like been around long enough that maybe we should like address that in our app or
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:01.480]   whatever. And so finding things that I can I can 3D touch and having stuff happen makes it
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:05.720]   easier to use my phone, makes it more fun to use my phone, makes it more efficient when I'm trying
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:11.720]   to do things when I'm out and about. So I've enjoyed actually the software upgrade quite a bit,
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:16.840]   even though I have yet to get a new phone jet blacker otherwise. Yeah, I do think the camera
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.840]   on the on the iPhones are just brilliant, both in a way of Apple continuing to distinguish the
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:28.520]   iPhone from competitors that in many ways, it's hard to tell the functional difference between A and
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:35.240]   B. It seems to be a stylistic difference in so many categories. But the iPhone, as I'm a guy who
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:41.640]   tests like 12 to 18 different camera phones a year still is head and shoulders above the rest.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:47.800]   And mostly because it's the one camera that if I take it out of my pocket and I press this big
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:52.680]   run button to take a picture, it takes a picture instantly. And it's going to be almost always a
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:57.720]   really good picture. So that's why we've been I didn't link to him in the show knows because I
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:03.320]   didn't want to talk about him this week. But there is inevitably they will I I took I took them
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:09.560]   the Samsung Note 7 and this new HTC phone. And I've proved categorically that has despite the
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:16.520]   marketing hype that Apple would like you to believe it's not as good as the simple working class
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:22.680]   Android phones. And it's like, okay, I can I can I can I go through my flicker feed and I sometimes
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:28.680]   can't tell the difference between great photos that I I'm very proud of that I shot with a $300
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:33.640]   phone once I shot with an iPhone and things I shot with my really expensive, like for real camera.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:39.720]   It really comes down to the great camera is, will it act the way it's supposed to act in every
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:45.240]   situation? Will it let you down? You can't really cherry pick here is a brilliant picture that this
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:50.600]   one other camera that he put them side by side. Okay, I guess the sky is a little less blue in this
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:56.600]   one, because that's kind of useless. So yeah, I'm super excited. I'm hoping that I get my my
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:03.320]   loaner phone by next Tuesday, because on Wednesday, I go to New York Comic Con for four or five days.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:10.600]   And you got all of your demo photos of portrait mode are really, really lovely, but you don't have
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:16.840]   Harley Quinn or Superman or Captain America or Black Widow in portrait mode. So I think that
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:23.480]   that's where my that's if I can't have additional insights or brilliance, I can at least have comic
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:30.920]   book cosplayers as my demo images. Now, we're gonna move on to Apple music steel everybody.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.160]   Steel to drink drink if you got them, we're gonna talk about Apple music for some reason.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.400]   There's a lot of activity this week. Jim, I really want him as being typecast.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:48.760]   It's he's just so good at talking about this stuff. And so when there's when BuzzFeed gets
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.960]   another one of these, I don't know how to put it there there's been sort of a category of
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:09:01.560]   interview interview. Let's say articles that include conversations with high Apple executives
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:07.320]   that aren't the back and forth Playboy style interviews where it's a conversation that goes on
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:14.440]   for pages. It's the article itself is maybe 1400 to 1600 words. The actual direct quotes and
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:21.000]   answers to questions are maybe two or 300 questions. So the articles feels a little bit like a host
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.560]   organism for these five or six really good quotes they got in whatever time the Apple made available
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:34.120]   this executive to this reporter. But it is a it is a it's called BuzzFeed had an article called
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:41.160]   Inside Apple's Apple Music Second Act. And it shows kind of a contrite Apple that is willing to
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:47.560]   admit that they made mistakes and they're not necessarily back pedaling but they're not going
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:52.280]   to pretend that the launch has been a success total success and that everybody's really happy
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.600]   with it. They are really admitting that we're rethinking a lot of things and we try to make
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.080]   Apple music be way too many things to weigh many people. This is these are direct quotes from
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:06.040]   Jimmy Iovine. He's a quote saying, I don't know how to do this any other way except to help make
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.200]   really good music, get exposed and get it handled and treated the way it deserves to be treated.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.680]   And you use all the tools you have to do that. Jim, is this is this a ray of sunshine that
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:22.520]   the maybe the cold winter is about to about to break and that we will gamble and romp and play
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:28.600]   in the verdant fields of iTunes once again as happy citizens? No. Okay. No.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:42.280]   I mean, I think that what what Apple did in the beginning was just a right lie to us.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.520]   There's no other way to put it. They said that you could do all this wonderful stuff and you
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:57.480]   couldn't. Now, since then Apple music has made some marvelous vast improvements in the service.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:06.040]   But what I don't think that Apple really gets in as far as music goes is that what we want and expect
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:17.240]   from Apple music is an app and a service that is the best, the absolute best, not second best,
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:22.280]   not third best, not that oh, if I want to do this, I should go to Spotify because they can do it
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:29.160]   and Apple music can. We want the best app and the best service. What Apple views that or what it
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:34.840]   seems like they view that is you want more celebrities. So we'll give you more celebrities.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.920]   Don't look at the app. Don't know look over here. Look over here with the celebrities that don't
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:43.640]   look at the app because you don't want to look at the app. And that's what it seems like to me.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:51.320]   Every time you hear something about Apple music, it's with a celebrity. There's a celebrity here,
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:57.880]   there or everywhere. That's there's a celebrity somewhere. When you hear about other products,
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:04.680]   it's about a product. It's about the iPhone. It's about iOS. Look how good this is. This product
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:10.040]   is going to change your life. This is what we can do. Look how we built this. And Apple music is
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.160]   still over here. Look over here. Over here. Look at the celebrities. See how pretty they are?
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:22.600]   Nice celebrities. And I don't think that they, at first I thought maybe it was that they didn't
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:29.800]   really care about the product. But I think that's what they feel that people want. And I personally,
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:36.280]   I don't think that that's what people want. I think people want the same product out of Apple
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:43.960]   music that they want from an iPhone or an iOS iPad Mac. They want a brilliant product. And I don't
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:51.080]   think that they've delivered that to a shit. And I have, in saying all of that, the service has
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:57.880]   gotten a hundred times better than when they first launched it. The actual behind the scenes
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:04.840]   service is brilliant. It works. You can actually download music. You can do all kinds of different
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:12.840]   things. Excuse me, the song choices, great, great song choices. iTunes match still doesn't work for
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:19.640]   me. It may work for other people. Not sure. But when a song plays, it doesn't know that I already
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.840]   have this, not only this song, but the entire album in my library. When I check on Apple music,
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:30.760]   it'll say that I have three of those songs. Well, no, I have all 10 of those songs on the album.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:36.680]   Some of these albums I've actually purchased from Apple. And it still doesn't know that I have them
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.480]   in my iTunes library. So that kind of stuff is frustrating because I'll look at it and say,
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:46.200]   you know, maybe it's an old song, I'll look at it and say, I thought I had this. So I'll add it.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.200]   And then when I look at my iTunes library, now I have two of those.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:58.440]   You know, so I mean, there's very few things at this point. I think that need to be fixed with
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:07.480]   iTunes with Apple music. iTunes matches certainly one of them. The team working on Apple music is
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:17.320]   doing a great job. I think Apple needs to refocus what is important in Apple music. I think that
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:24.840]   it should be the product. They think it should be marching celebrities around to show off Apple
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.320]   music. And I don't think that's where it should be. Yeah, that's certainly a good point. I was
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:36.520]   really surprised. I wasn't surprised when Drake has this album views and it's been according to
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:41.720]   Apple and Apple music. It's the first album to reach one billion streams on Apple music.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:46.440]   And okay, it's a nice round number. Our brains are wired up to think that nice round numbers
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:54.200]   are impressive. But not only that, but Tim Cook and Eddie Q presented personally, Drake with a
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:15:00.520]   plaque celebrating his achievement backstage after one of his concerts. And you can see it on his
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:07.720]   Instagram actually pulled the full resolution. And yeah, it's a big it's a big bus ad like
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.800]   posters saying first album to achieve over one billion streams on Apple music. I wonder who designed
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:17.880]   that poster. You don't obviously it's not a record or a CD. So they can't have like the gold
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:23.800]   record. But they have the way they did it looks like they took a bunch of electrons and had them
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.120]   titanium plated. I stopped counting, but I think they're at least 18 to 20 of them
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:33.080]   mounted there in a nice little fan arrangement. But it's weird. It's not like a big press release
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:38.520]   sort of thing. It's like they just went to the concert to Eddie threw the thing in the back of his
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:45.800]   wagon, wagon arrow, and I can finish framing it. Right. Exactly. They went to pottery barn to
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:51.880]   you know, get the decided, no, let's splash. Let's not go for the 11 by 17. Let's go for the 18 by 24.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:57.400]   Drake will really appreciate that. And that's a weird thing to have such high level executives
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:04.680]   going that going that far for what seems to be just a gesture to tell Drake, we love you. Boy,
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:10.760]   do we love you? Oh my goodness. Are you valuable to our organization? You are so important to us.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:15.400]   Holy cow here. Do you want to have the new iPhone eight? It's taped. It's taped to the back of the
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:21.240]   plaque. This is I mean, this is old fashioned when you've got to when you've got a hit artist that
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.280]   is helping your business, helping your record company be a success. You have people on staff
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:30.600]   whose job it is to make sure that if they want the next Harry Potter book, that's not going to be
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.240]   published for a year and a half that dammit, you will find a copy of the next Harry Potter book and
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.200]   make sure that he or she has it because you have to keep them happy and keep making them feel loved.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:46.920]   It just felt a little bit off to see again, Tim Cook taking that stance. I don't know if he's
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:55.240]   particularly a fan of Drake. I'm sure he's a fan of the six. I have to admit that I saw Drake
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:01.160]   and I added the phrase coffee cake to the end of that. So I'm not that the Intel processor. That's
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.640]   not Drake. I mean, those are very easily confused. Coffee cake is an Intel fab. Drake is a singer.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:11.160]   So did this affect you the same way? I wasn't hurt or offended by it. It just seemed odd.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:16.760]   No, I mean, so yeah, I mean, the whole thing to me is odd. And I don't get the music business.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.360]   Music is one of those things that I have no insight into. I watch Netflix. I don't listen to a lot of
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:26.280]   music and I can feel Del Rumpel shaking his head already. So I don't understand this business at
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:30.360]   all. When Apple bought into it and they brought Jimmy Ivey in on it and it seems like Eddie
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.040]   Q is more involved with this. But iTunes is its own organization. They've got their own events
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:40.280]   team, their own marketing team. They run iTunes festivals. And I just don't know. I think I
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:45.080]   understand a little bit of what Apple's business is. I don't understand the streaming music business
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:50.120]   at all. And I understand that Apple feels they need to be relevant in music because it is part of
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.760]   their DNA. And that means now streaming music. I still don't understand how streaming music is a
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:01.320]   business because the profits seem almost nonexistent for both artists and for intermediaries. And the
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.800]   whole thing is baffling to me. But if James Corden and Tim Cook are still in that little car and
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.800]   they're driving around and they have a poster that Craig framed in the back and they want to drop
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:15.640]   it off for Drake, I mean, more power to them. I don't understand either, Andy. I'm sorry.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:21.240]   Yeah, it's a little strange to me there. They when they in this article previously, of course,
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.160]   they underscore something that we've known for a while, which is that Apple is not just interested
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:32.600]   in being another vendor of an artist's catalog, but also helping them creatively. Another piece of
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:39.480]   another Drake news this week. Drake debuted a 23 minute short called Please Forgive Me exclusively
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:45.000]   on Apple Music. And we keep hearing about Apple Music working with and working with these artists
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.360]   and helping them and bankrolling them when they want to make these short films. And also having
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:56.040]   creative input and just a level of involvement that dare I say goes into the selection of the
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:02.360]   chamfer angle on an iPhone charger. I was another thing that kind of surprised me. At the end of
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:08.360]   the presidential debates last night, at least in the streaming version, there was a promo from Apple
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:15.640]   Music for a show called the 411 with Mary Blige and Mary J. Blige is talking to Hillary Clinton
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:23.960]   in a very Oprah show, Ask Sort of Set. And she it gets super awkward. It's because she starts
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:31.640]   singing to Hillary Clinton. And Hillary is a wonderful candidate. I think she's great. She is not
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:37.000]   really she's not really wired for being sung at by somebody sincerely three feet away from her.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.120]   And she has this facial expression that makes me think that she's already pushed the secret
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.840]   button on her wristwatch. And she knows when she counts to 12 Mississippi, the Secret Service will
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:52.680]   burst in, leap her, pick her up off the chair and Greg Mrs. Clinton to safety. It's a very,
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:59.720]   very awkward thing. But it shows that how involved Apple is in creating brand new content. Kelly,
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:07.240]   I mean, you're I mean, you and all of us here are kind of old timers with Apple. And I mean,
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:13.160]   but we have this idea of engineers who are building computers. And it's hard to think of Apple as
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:20.600]   a diverse company that's also interested in putting on a what looks like a very slightly,
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:27.720]   I shouldn't judge 30 seconds, but there's 60 seconds clip. But it was a very I find this clip
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:33.000]   is a very odd clip. It's hard for us to start for me to think of Apple as a company that is
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.920]   as involved in something like that as they are and something involving involving things that have
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:44.920]   a system clock and involve a little ram. Yeah, how do you navigate this?
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:51.720]   Um, well, partly the thing that sticks in my head, and I know that it shouldn't because it
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:59.960]   didn't stick around anywhere else is paying anything. Apple makes beautiful
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:08.280]   hardware and really nice software. And people use that to create other stuff. And it feels
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:15.000]   like when Apple tries to get on the other side of that, you know, that it doesn't go as well as
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:22.680]   it should. And that's kind of where, where what I feel like with it, um, like I, I want it to be
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:28.520]   cool in me and interesting, but I think, you know, the part that sort of gives me a little bit of
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:37.240]   faith in Apple is that they went by us. We're going to let James Corden, you know, do his show on
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.320]   Apple music. And we're going to do that instead of, you know, us trying to create something
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:46.120]   ourselves. And because it seems like whenever they've tried to build something, themselves, it hasn't
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:51.960]   gone as well as it should have, because I think of things like paying and the initial version of
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:58.840]   Apple music and the difficulty Jim had with it at the time. And the different things like that,
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:04.600]   where it seems like as soon as they step a full step away from hardware and software,
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:11.480]   you know, it's all, it's all kind of a mess. And I want that to be better, but I also sort of
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:20.040]   want them to stay in their own lane a little bit. So I find it very sort of curious to watch. I
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:24.120]   sort of watch and go, well, huh, like that's not a company that I know anything about that I have
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:29.640]   any history with, that I follow very closely at all. When I watch that kind of stuff, that's sort
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:35.320]   of what I think about is, huh, because I remember in the old days when you could get Apple documentation
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:40.120]   that would have very good ladies in it. And it was like this secret in joke that you knew why
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:45.720]   there were two partitions on the hard drive and one was shoebox and one was the old apartment.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:52.360]   And I got why, you know, some of those little references were around, but then as, you know,
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:57.800]   like you too gave an album to everybody and, you know, that sort of stuff, I look at that and I
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:03.160]   kind of think I don't have any idea who this company is at all. Renee, do you think that Apple
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:08.040]   can might be confronting a perception problem of how people think of them? Like again, not as a
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:13.960]   bunch of engineers that focus on deleting, on reducing the I-seat count on a music player,
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:18.200]   but as someone who wants to have their picture taken backstage at a rock concert with a famous
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.200]   celebrity. I mean, I think that, you know, in Jim's been to a lot of these festivals,
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.000]   you can probably speak to it better, but I think Apple's, you know, they've as long as they've
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.600]   had iTunes, they've had close proximity to the music industry and this is just making it
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:34.520]   front-facing. But it's one of those things where there's this balancing act. And I think it's the
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:40.760]   same with iMessageFX, you know, like you get it right and it's like the slam or the emojification
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:45.160]   and it just feels like you're hip and you get it wrong. And, you know, maybe it's like the 18th
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.960]   time someone sends you lasers and it feels like your dad is trying to make his own version of Snapchat.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:55.480]   And I think this is similar. You have Apple Music and on one hand, if they can nail it,
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:00.920]   then they're the young, hot, hip, trendy, new, happening music thing. And it's the iPod Halo
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:05.960]   all over again. You get it wrong and it really is like, like, like your mom trying to reinvent
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:11.240]   Spotify. And that's the danger is like, it's a very, very difficult note to hit. And you go
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:14.840]   too much the wrong way and you're alienating, you go too much the wrong way and you're observed.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:20.600]   And Apple has been sort of weaving back and forth between those two things now. And some people
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:23.560]   really liked James Gordon. Some people really didn't like it. Some people really liked Drake.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.400]   Some people really didn't like it. And that's sort of a really hard
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:33.560]   road to navigate if you are only ever in that business. And Apple is not Apple is an iPhone
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.880]   maker that is trying to annex this as its next nearest neighbor business. And I think we're
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.440]   seeing sort of the struggles with that. Jim, do you think there'll ever be a day when someone
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:48.360]   will tell some really talented engineer? I don't think you can work at Apple. You're not good looking
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:55.240]   enough to work at Apple. You know what? The great thing about about Apple over the years is that
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:03.160]   they like to hire the smartest people that they can. And I don't think that, I mean,
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:06.520]   Apple would tell me that you can't work there because you're not pretty enough.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:14.760]   But I have so much respect for the engineers that work at Apple because I think that they're
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:22.680]   they all want to make the best products that they can. And we all know engineers at Apple.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:27.240]   And I don't think that we could ever talk to any of them that they just say, "Oh, you know,
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:33.160]   I show up, I do my job, and then I go home." There's middle managers I know like that, but not
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:42.280]   engineers. I mean, these guys really want to work hard. And for the most part, when you see an
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:50.760]   Apple product come out, whether it's a big one or a small one, they take the hard tasks and make
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   them seem so simple. You know, even look at the music memos that came out for iPhone earlier in
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:06.600]   the year. And just an amazing little app, but they put so much into it to make it work so well.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:13.240]   And sometimes when things like Apple Music happen, we forget about all of the great stuff that Apple
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:24.520]   does. So I hope that at some point, some executives at Apple just say, "Enough." And let's focus on
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:32.920]   this product and make it the absolute best product that Apple can make. And if they do that,
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:38.520]   they will blow everybody else out of the water. That's what they need to do. And I know
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:44.440]   that that's an easy... It sounds easy coming from me. I'm just saying, in my opinion, that's what
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:51.080]   they need to do. And instead of getting your picture taken backstage at every concert that you can
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:27:00.120]   lay your hands on, to me, that's not as important because I still wake up in the morning and open
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:06.520]   up Apple Music and start playing music. There is nobody in the world that wants Apple Music to work
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:13.640]   more than me because I have invested thousands of dollars in purchasing music from iTunes.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:20.920]   I am a subscriber to Apple Music. I want this to work because I am a customer. And I know a lot
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:29.000]   of musicians and I want them to be successful. I want Apple to be successful. Mostly, I want to be
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:38.120]   satisfied as a customer. And they're going, and in the past year, have gone a long way to
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:45.080]   making sure that I am. And every other customer, for that matter, that the service is working a
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:50.040]   lot better. But they still have some work to do. And that's where I would like to see the focus of
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:56.040]   Apple Music. I will say, though, that if I saw a picture of Tim Cook's office and I saw that on
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:01.000]   the back of his office door, he had just this sheath and bushel of backstage laminates from
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.200]   every concert he's gone to. I could definitely respect that. We're here with Jim Dallerable from
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:10.680]   the loop. We've got Renee, of course, from Imor and Kelly Gamont from Mac Observer and
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:15.080]   Appcamp for Girls. And now we have another message from the way fairing Leo Le Porte.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:19.480]   We'll have more Mac break weekly. Just a bit. Thank you, gentlemen, for filling in for me on
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:25.000]   my vacation here, though, I have to talk to you about something that changed my life
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:33.160]   in about 2004, 2005, when I was going down, going up, I guess, to Canada every month to do the TV show.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:38.920]   Billing was the biggest hassle. Nobody gets nobody starts a business. Somebody comes a freelancer
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:45.240]   because they like doing invoices. That's not the fun part. The fun part is doing the work.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.120]   But you got to get paid and you don't get paid unless you bill and you got a bill.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:54.840]   And come to the end of the month, I would just it was just a fire up excel, fire up,
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:29:01.000]   you know, the word, create an invoice, print it, mail, and all that stuff. It just was a lot of
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.320]   work. And I would put it off sometimes. And then, of course, I wouldn't get paid, which is no fun.
[01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:10.440]   That's when Amber told me about FreshBooks and I love it. Now 10 years later, more than five
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:16.920]   million small business owners have had their life saved by FreshBooks. FreshBooks is the dead
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:22.280]   simple cloud accounting software that is transforming how small business owners handle their paperwork.
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:26.120]   It'll help you do your invoicing. It literally takes 30 seconds. Your logo's on there.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:32.200]   You could set up recurring invoices. So it even happens automatically. If you do receipts,
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:38.120]   expenses, which I did, you can take pictures of the receipts with the FreshBooks app. It goes
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:44.760]   right into the FreshBooks invoice. I mean, it just couldn't be easier. And it's easier for your
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.400]   clients too. And clients will pay you faster when they get their FreshBooks invoice because there's
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:53.880]   a big button there that says, "Pay Leo." And they press that button and then they can use many,
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.160]   there's a variety of different online payment services they pay you. And it's off their mind,
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:02.840]   it's off their books and you get paid faster. On average, five days faster with FreshBooks.
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:08.600]   You can even set up auto payment reminders. And should people be slow to pay, they'll handle that too.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:13.320]   There's a super handy. This is new since I used it. There's a super handy deposit feature.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:18.280]   So you can invoice for payment upfront. I wish I had this when you're kicking off a project.
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:24.920]   And FreshBooks will arrange the payments all automatically. You can also import expenses
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.720]   automatically. It works with a variety of different other programs. It actually works with,
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:35.400]   they have an EMV card reader, which is cool. So if your business takes you to people's houses,
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.480]   you can do the whole thing on the FreshBooks app. You can create an estimate,
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:45.480]   create an invoice. They can pay the invoice using the EMV reader and you're good to go.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:50.680]   That's pretty amazing. FreshBooks. Go to freshbooks.com/macbreak. You can try it

[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:20.520]   Well, thank you so very much, Leo. When Kelly agreed to come on, there is one thing I really
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:26.440]   wanted to hear her talk about. Kelly is one of the many hardworking people doing such wonderful
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:35.480]   work with Appcamp4Girls. Just teaching people how to code. And I would be a very rich developer
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:41.480]   today. Instead of a very proud of my humble existence journalist, Ted, I had the sort of
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:49.000]   education that you give kids on a regular basis. I've got Appcamp4Girls stickers pretty much on
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:55.800]   every surface that will adhere stickers. I'm so jazzed about it. And so I really wanted to hear
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:01.880]   what you have to... What your reaction is to swift playgrounds. That's, of course, Apple's
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:07.560]   iPad app. It requires iOS 10. So it's finally out the past couple of weeks. That is called
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:11.800]   a revolutionary new app for iPad that makes it fun to learn and experiment with code. You solve
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:16.040]   interactive puzzles and the guided learn-to-code sessions to master the basics of coding while
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:19.960]   additional challenges let you explore code and create programs that are engaging and unique.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:29.400]   I've played with it. It certainly makes it... Hello World is that I wrote an AppleSoft basic
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:33.000]   when I was 10 years old is not nearly as cool as the first piece of code that people are going
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.600]   to write with swift playgrounds. But as a seasoned educator who works with the people who Apple's
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:45.960]   trying to benefit with this app, do you think it hits the mark? I do. One of my favorite things
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:54.600]   about it, one of the great things about it existing is that it reaches a lot of places that
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:03.400]   Appcamp doesn't reach right now. We're in six locations. And we do get a fair amount of email
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:09.960]   from people who say, "You're not where... You don't have a session where I am," or "My daughter is
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:15.240]   much younger than the girls that you have at camp because we have girls who are going into
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:22.200]   grades eight or nine." And my daughter is a fifth grader or I live somewhere on the East Coast or
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:29.960]   I live somewhere in Vancouver or somewhere in Canada that isn't Vancouver. And I want to get my
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:36.680]   daughter started on doing something like this. And all you need is an iPad with iOS 10 and you can
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:43.800]   get cracking on that now officially in Swift. There's been other things there's scratch. You can use
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:50.440]   which is cute and neat. Pixel press floors is a fun way to learn some basics about developing games.
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:59.240]   And this looks amazing and I'm super, super excited. I know a couple our founders, Gene
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:06.680]   McDonald and Gray Osen were actually there in the keynote at WWDC and were able to see this happen
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:12.760]   in person. And they were unbelievably excited about how this was going to work and what this could
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:24.200]   do for us. As a community of people who really want to teach anyone to learn to program, the way it
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:31.720]   could possibly democratize, being able to build something very basic for yourself if you need a
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:38.280]   particular tool to get something done. And I know I've talked to a lot of developers in my life,
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:45.560]   with developers, Mac developers, Windows developers, all kinds of people who build things with code.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:53.880]   And almost all of them said I learned some flavor of coding or scripting because I was trying to
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:59.640]   solve a problem that I had and I wanted to automate it or I needed a tool to do something in particular
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:06.600]   for me. And so I learned to build something and then that was kind of fun. So I built another thing
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:14.200]   and another thing and now here we are. And I'm unbelievably pumped about this. I am so excited
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:21.480]   that there are going to be so many people who will have a more basic understanding of technology
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:27.480]   in the first place. Like in the old days, you know, with an Apple IIE and basic, you didn't really get
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:34.760]   that. And with Mac OS and before there was Xcode even where you could actually do some development,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:42.920]   being able to develop stuff on the Mac was not easy to put it very diplomatically.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:50.040]   So I think it's fantastic. I don't think there's any things that should keep people
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:56.040]   who are interested in learning about code or how to code from doing so. And I'm really glad that
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.200]   Apple has brought this to the iPad in order to make that happen primarily because when we talk
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:06.520]   to people at AppCamp, we have a lot of people who still have PCs at home but maybe have an iPad or
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:13.080]   everyone in the family has iPhones but the computer at home is a PC. And so for some of those girls,
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:19.400]   after a week of camp, after being a software developer for a week because they build two apps
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:25.480]   in a week, that screeches to a halt because the PC is the limiting factor and now it doesn't have
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:31.160]   to be. And I'm super excited to see what people build with this. I'm super excited to see if
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:36.040]   you can build something basic and Swift Playgrounds and put it in the App Store.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:41.160]   And then people could be real life developers by building something really interesting strictly
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:47.480]   on the iPad for the iPad and now other people can have it too. The possibilities of this to me are
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:53.320]   just unbelievably exciting. I can't wait. When you're teaching these classes and you get to see these
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:37:01.080]   people, these kids, write their first code, do you have any opinions on the idea of building
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:08.920]   things as a team versus learning on your own and working through a workbook versus, as you say,
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:13.240]   just the idea of I want to build something that does this and I'm going to learn what I have to
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.920]   learn in order to make this happen. I'm sure there's no wrong ways long as you're learning but when
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:23.000]   all the experience you've had in those classrooms, what really engages kids and really
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.360]   gets their, gets the spins into a higher orbit about learning the stuff.
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:33.720]   Well, it usually depends on what they're working on. There's always one girl who sits in front of
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:42.520]   Xcode and goes, "Oh, it's beautiful." And then there's one person we worry about her a little.
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:47.400]   I'm kidding. Then there's somebody who realizes when you load the app on an iPad,
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:55.160]   on an I and you turn it sideways and it breaks and they go, "Breaking stuff is awesome." And then
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:02.440]   that person is fantastic. And then there's somebody else who gets really excited about designing the
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:08.360]   artwork that goes into all of the applications and there's somebody who gets really excited to get
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:11.960]   to build slides to tell everybody about it because there's a presentation at the end of the week.
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:18.280]   A lot of it is that we do put them in teams very early on so there are groups of four
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:26.040]   and the great thing about it is that the team dynamic really seems to help and we have them
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:32.360]   teach each other. So one person sits at the computer and learns as someone in the front is
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:37.000]   explaining what's happening and then the person sitting at the computer teaches the next person
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.800]   how to do it. So we know that they understand it because they were able to explain it to the next
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:49.880]   person and then so on down the line. And so for us it's a really fantastic opportunity
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:57.960]   to see all those different learning styles to find out what really engages people. And really
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:04.440]   the thing that I think does the most to help them is that at the end of the first day on Monday
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:09.880]   morning when they come in and may know some other people that are at camps with them that week and
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:15.480]   sometimes don't. Every developer goes home on Monday afternoon with the iPod touch that we
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:23.640]   loan them for the week and it has a calculator app on it that they built. And getting that physical
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:30.520]   thing to go and hold up at home and show people I think that that is a huge motivator. I think
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:35.960]   that's the thing that really gets them. It's sort of you know playing in your garage for years is
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:41.320]   one thing but hearing that song on the radio is quite another and that's sort of what this is.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:46.280]   It's like my song on the radio. And then at the end of the week we take all of the they build quiz
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:52.680]   apps. Each team builds a quiz and then we compile all the quizzes and release that in the app store.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:57.880]   And so all these girls who spent a week at camp in the summer have an app in the app store.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:07.800]   And I really like giving that opportunity to people. And I really like like that doesn't even always
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:11.320]   seem to be the part that really engages them. It's just really being able to see it on the screen
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.400]   that makes them go oh yeah this is totally something that I'm very interested in.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:21.960]   You're doing a great thing. I was just gonna say that must be an amazing blessing. When you see
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:27.880]   a kid realize that hey I made that that didn't exist before I thought of it and made it. Even if
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:33.080]   the kid who got in trouble at school for making a clock and bringing it to school it didn't matter
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.080]   that. And you look at it you see okay I can see that he kind of took apart a clock and built it
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:42.840]   inside a new case. That doesn't matter because this freak of nature looking timepiece didn't exist
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:47.800]   until he decided that it would be nice if this box would be nice if it had a clock in it. And
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:53.640]   it's it must be amazing to see kids at a time of their life where they have no control over their
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:57.480]   environment because they're always being told what's the time you go to school and here's your lunch
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:02.760]   that you're gonna eat. And the first time that they have that act of creation saying that I can
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:08.680]   have an influence over the world around me and it just it's just me coming up with an idea and
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:14.600]   executing it and working on it. That must be such a such a jolt in the arm for you. As soon as.
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:20.920]   Oh absolutely. As soon as you have a app camp for grumpy old men. I mean because I can't build
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:27.880]   anything so every app for grumpy old. Exactly. That's that's that's the rest of the app.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:34.680]   Stanford. Yeah that's all the other app camp. So that's why we have the girl one. Really like
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:40.040]   one of the moments that I love is when we get to the artwork portion and people have some of the
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.920]   developers have drawn stuff and then fed it to the scanner so it shows up on the screen and then
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:52.760]   they drag it into X code into the storyboard and let go and now the app has a panel with the text
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:57.640]   of the question and the buttons with the possible responses and it's got the all the stage of
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:04.360]   you 10 minutes ago dropped in behind it and watching their faces when that moment happens and seeing
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:10.440]   that that's something that that you know now let's build it you know I always encourage our project
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:15.240]   team leads to once that first image is in to load it again on the iPods and let them play with it
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:21.240]   and then they get there and can see in their hand what they were doing 15 minutes ago and that is
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:26.920]   super exciting and and getting that physical manifestation of the thing that I just drew on
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:32.600]   paper and now it's in part of this app is really fantastic. Have you ever taught classes to people
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:37.000]   who have already whether kids are adults people who have already learned some kind of a programming
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.040]   language and now they're new to Mac development and how is that different from when you starting
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:46.760]   with kids who are an absolute clean slate I imagine they can just smoke people who have no
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:54.520]   bad habits to to expunge before they can start building apps. We have had a few developers who
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:43:01.960]   show up to camp and have done some work in some other language whether it's JavaScript or spent a
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:09.720]   bunch of time in scratch or done something you know with a computer club and a lot of times it's
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:16.760]   for them it's almost harder because they have to sort of unlearn the specifics of doing it in the
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:21.480]   other language even though like if they sort of let go of that they have all the concepts down
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:27.480]   like certain things work and what do you do when they don't and how do you make how do you make
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:33.000]   allowances for that and how do you figure out when to draw the line and just throw an error you know
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:41.240]   if there's something else going on and it's interesting to see how some people who do know
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:46.680]   something already some people really take to it they just sort of like can can flip the switch in
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:51.240]   their brains and go all right I can do this and swift now it's the same thing I was doing in this
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:57.160]   other language that I knew before and I'm having little flashbacks because I was there for all the
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:02.520]   pictures so I'm like oh I remember her that was really great and oh look I want you know and I
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:08.680]   wonder what she's doing now and I want to share a story of one of my favorite campers in our first
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:15.400]   year she was one of our campers in our first year she was a beta session person and she has gone on
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:21.880]   to join the computer club at her high school which built a a mobile app both an iPhone version I
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.680]   think in an Android version for looking at books at the library and it was a very basic thing but
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:33.160]   they really sit and it was awesome and she has gone on to intern with a company out on the west side
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:39.880]   of Portland and built a security conference security is cyber security is totally a thing that she's
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:46.520]   into and she put on her she was one of the people who helped organize a security conference for high
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:53.000]   school kids to go attend just this summer and so I'm really excited because I feel like even if it
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:58.760]   was a teeny tiny bit like we helped with that by showing her that that was a possibility yeah
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:07.000]   it's it's like the best gift you can give a kid is to point them to a door to a room or a world
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:12.440]   that they did not know exist you know because sometimes you know childhood kind of stinks on
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.240]   many levels and most often because you feel as though you're trapped in an environment that is
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:24.200]   that you don't like and when you first realize that oh if I go in here there is something that is
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:29.240]   where there is color and there are there's the fragrance smells and there are wonderful
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:36.760]   wonderful things to see and wonderful things to hear it's it must be a great a great gift a great
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:41.720]   gift we need to get to our picks of the week but before then I just want to touch on an interesting
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:49.720]   piece of government public information from the FCC last week I think on the 16th of September
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:56.360]   Apple received FCC certification for something described in this document as quote a wireless
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:02.920]   device with Bluetooth and NFC capability and as part of the FCC certification they have they
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:09.560]   reproduce the regulatory label that appears on this device and from that we can only ascertain
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:16.520]   that it has at least two rounded corners that are secured by Torx screws it is registered as
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:24.840]   app as Apple model a 1844 I'm trying to figure out from the documents what this thing could
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.960]   possibly do all the testing you can see tables and tables and charts of frequencies basically
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:35.560]   it's there to make sure that's not going to create interference and wreak havoc on on any other nearby
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:40.840]   devices with its radio emissions and almost all the frequencies that it's being tested for are
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:46.600]   simple and NFC recognizable NFC frequencies but interesting that it has power the power
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:54.440]   requirements are minimum of 5.5 volts and 100 milliamps which is next to nothing it also has a on
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:47:00.520]   again printed on the bottom of this is a wiring diagram for a four pin connector that is referenced
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:06.360]   somewhere else in that document that I saw and all that it's just a simple four pin connector that has
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:16.520]   plus volts DC a ground and a and two RS 485 serial data signaling lines it's just a half duplex
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:24.200]   really dirt simple serial connection meaning that I can't even talk back and forth at the same time
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:28.680]   it has to one device talks the other and then when that communication is done the other device
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:34.120]   talks back RS 485 is again the simplest way you can have one device talk to another it's often
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.840]   used for like if you got an irrigation system and you want to know how wet that part of the thing is
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:45.080]   and you don't have wireless yet that's what you use I'm kind of baffled as what it could be
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:51.480]   it could I'm wondering if it could be just something that Apple's playing with and because
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:57.400]   they're letting partners have them to test out they have to get certified I did also did some
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:02.520]   Google searching the senior the under underwriters laboratory laboratory the usual you know the famous
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:08.920]   UL logo on the bottom of it the senior engineer on this test was a man by the name of chin pang
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:17.880]   and he his name also appears on a lot of other apple FCC certifications and not surprisingly
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:23.880]   it will be documents much like this in which anything that identifies exactly what this thing
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:29.880]   is is censored but there are model numbers and typically they'll be like last year he tested a
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:36.200]   batch of five model number devices and which all turned out to be the iPhone 6s and everything
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:41.960]   else that was released just two or three weeks after this certification certification testing
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:50.280]   was completed so maybe it is an actual device that's going to be released at the event that some of us
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:58.200]   seem to think is going to happen in October I I I I I paste it in these details and I'm really
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:04.440]   curious to see what Renee thinks about it because you often really know about a lot of the nuts and
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:09.320]   bolts of how Apple goes about the business of developing something and pushing it through
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:14.360]   the pipeline towards towards the shelves eventually yeah I didn't have too much time to look into it
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:21.240]   I saw the note and you know 1600 A 1600s and A 1700s are the model numbers for iPhones and iPads
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:27.800]   and I don't know what is the A 1800 series whether it's you know power cable series remotes
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:34.360]   or some other thing so I'd be curious to know what this is too Andy yeah I mean I was also
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:40.840]   thinking about maybe it's uh it's uh again all the the areas that were tested yeah I mean well
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:47.880]   Bluetooth and it Bluetooth and NFC so it could be a form of Ibacon that's not meant to be like a
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.520]   commercial consumer product but something that they sell to a shopping mall or a business so that
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:58.440]   they can help people locate locate themselves on a map somewhere I mean it could be so many things
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:06.520]   it's just such a a tantalizing half pile of information and then you really want to get out your crayon
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:10.760]   and try to fill in the rest of it and so that two weeks from now you can claim to be clever or
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:15.320]   hope that people forget about the stupid things you said during that podcast based on partial
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:22.120]   information what have we heard about December we still think there's going to be at least a
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:28.920]   Macbook event anybody I think October they'd have to do it by October I think they'd have to do it
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.760]   before Black Friday because that's going to be the last you know big launching for the holiday season
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.360]   okay well yeah okay it's okay Jim already has a new Macbook so he doesn't care
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:49.080]   yeah I'm waiting to see how good these things are to find out if I have to arrange another
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:55.960]   accident so to speak with my now one year old Macbook you enjoy your OLED function row Jim
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:51:02.360]   we'll just wait for it like regular people I like having pretty new things I'm not pretty or new
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:09.960]   using it right now we'll be right back with our picks of the week after this our final appearance
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:15.160]   by the definitely not a super secret agent Leo Laporte.
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:20.680]   Gentlemen if I may squeeze in here for a moment as you know I am on vacation and I can tell you
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:27.560]   one of the things I loaded up before I went I fired up texture on my iPad and I loaded up with
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:34.040]   magazines all the latest issues of the best magazines over 200 magazines everything from us and people
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:38.600]   entertainment weekly because yeah I got to keep up with my gossip to popular mechanics popular

[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:58.760]   to food magazines recipes it's great and you probably could not or would not want to subscribe to all
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:03.960]   these magazines just imagine your coffee table buckling under all those magazines you probably
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:07.640]   don't even want I really don't want to buy it on the newsstand because those are expensive
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:14.200]   the easiest most affordable way to do it it's like Netflix Netflix for magazines texture I get
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:19.160]   notifications when articles and arenas that I'm interested in come in they have a new and noteworthy
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:25.160]   section they have top stories sections they have stuff you can't even get on the newsstand like video

[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:24.440]   of Mac break weekly now back to work gentlemen Mac break weekly continues and it is time for our
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:30.920]   picks of the week things that are sleep-addled brains have told us are wonderful things that
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:34.840]   we like to stand behind and recommend other people start with Renee Renee what's your pick this week
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:41.000]   so I have it's an interesting pick it's not something that I actually use but it's something that I
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.200]   think would be super informative for people to try one of my favorite things one I think is you know
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:50.840]   undersold in the new iPhone is the new taptic engine and it's that because it's one of the things
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:57.640]   at the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack gave its life to create extra space for but is significantly
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:01.720]   improved not just because it's handling the home button but because it is far better at creating
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:07.160]   specific and more targeted vibration effects which our fingers lie to us and tell us his actual
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:12.040]   emotion because physics are lie and fingers are liar liars so this is an app called noise and it's
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:18.280]   available on the app store and what it does is as you move your fingers over it you can feel sort
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:23.480]   of the taptic engine firing behind you and giving you an almost strum-like effect but then when you
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:30.920]   press deeply into it it sort of presses back and lets you feel uh i'll do it a little bit here but
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:38.040]   as you as you play with it if you press into it I can actually feel the vibration on in the sort
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:43.320]   of area where I'm pressing on it and yeah the iPhone 6s had a taptic engine and it did interesting
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:47.720]   things like it gave you the forced feedback when you did the 3d touch actions but this is both
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:53.880]   subtler and again it seems more location specific and and a better range of effects there's also a
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:58.440]   zombie gunship app where you can sort of you press the shotgun and you feel a boom effect but you
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:02.040]   press a little machine gun and you feel like a da da da da da da da da da da da effect and
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:06.920]   apple has opened up all these apis to developers and I'm really excited to see this because there's
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:12.280]   you know obviously accessibility implications for this because being able to feel the screen is
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:17.880]   much different for people who have lower no visibility but you know for everybody the time was you
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.360]   had like the rubber banding effect when you would scroll too far in a list view and now apple
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:26.440]   accompanies that with a little firing of the taptic engine and it doesn't feel like you're
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:30.040]   actually pulling something the wrong way because you know they can't do that yet but your brain
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.040]   sort of doesn't care it just it feels something and combined with your eyes it creates an even
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:38.120]   better perception that you've zoomed too far or scrolled too far and it's doing it for the
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:43.800]   little pickers when you rotate the number choose a little rotational dial you get a little tic-tic-tic
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:49.880]   tic-tic-tic feeling and all these things sort of create this extra sensory perception in iOS and
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:56.360]   that's great like the the unce unce unce lasers in iMessage well now you'll get a sort of a buzzing
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:01.560]   feeling from the taptic engine which makes it i can't say i'd watch it five or six more times but
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.360]   it makes it more interesting than just the visual one or two times but i think it's really the
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:10.760]   developers now they just got their hands on these apis when apple announced the new phones and
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:15.000]   they're only the people who have been doing sort of the prototype apps have fielded them but i think
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.600]   as developers chew into these we're gonna have a whole range of new apps and in particular
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:25.160]   exciting if you go to pick an accented character or an alternate punctuation and you move your
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:30.440]   finger over the the little cho- chooser pop up you feel a tic-tic-tic for every one of those and it
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:35.080]   used to be that you would give up the tactility to get the flexibility of a virtual screen but we're
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:39.800]   getting these hints that that's no longer trade-off yeah it won't be a little ticklet or tick-tac
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:45.960]   keyboard like a blackberry but we'll have sort of this this tactile feedback in a lot of the
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:51.240]   interactions that we do and it's way better than sort of those early buzzy phones that i tried you
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:56.440]   know three four years ago this is a much more specific action so whether you try it out on you
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:00.920]   know noise which is a pretty cool keyboard app or one of the other apps to come i think
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:06.680]   that the taptics are going to be a huge story yeah you're running me of i think an app that came
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:12.200]   up when uh apple either first-head or up seriously upgraded the gyroscopes it was just a shooting
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:16.520]   game where you would tilt the the phone to like move it's like shooting gallery just to move your
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:22.280]   target and it was the most fun game because it was just a developer who said it was this would be a
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:26.760]   really good way to use this new gadget we have inside the phone and sometimes you need these
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:31.880]   busy box sort of things and instead of waiting for the killer app that really shows the power and
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:38.200]   the the vistiness of the of the taptic engine no i just want to tap things and feel buzzes and
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:44.040]   really enjoy the different sensations that i'm getting uh very good pick uh kelly what's your pick
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:50.680]   this week i actually have to um the first one i'm gonna hold up and you're not gonna be able to see
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:57.240]   but it's the gin earth of action figure from rok one they're out now um i'm inordinately excited
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:04.360]   about this because she's freely available on shelves at my local grocery store um this is very very
[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:11.800]   different from one year ago um up until the present day trying to get my hands on a ray action figure
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:17.640]   which still has not happened so um i'm gonna plug that one i did look it up on amazon and amazon
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.360]   says it's not coming out for another week or so but i was able to commonly find it like i said at
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:27.480]   my store for admire and then um i know other people have talked about seeing them at walmart
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:32.280]   and twizzer us and things so you can get them there um that's exciting to me and that's a very
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:41.160]   small thing uh a larger thing which is um i'm gonna put this in the category of uh as best i understand
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:50.200]   it uh women and occasionally gym on alternate saturday nights and that is uh there's a skirt
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:58.760]   from think geek that has led light in it and you wire up the battery pack and it will twinkle
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:07.640]   in a dark room i mean not even in a dark room but it it lights up and it has a battery pack in it
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:15.480]   that takes a couple small batteries and all you have to do is plug them in and you're ready to rock
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:21.480]   and this is so awesome and i love this because uh this is the intersection of where i live
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:30.840]   which is a nerd who wears clothes and i would be willing to make an exception and wear a skirt
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:38.920]   if it lit up like this so i may actually purchase one um it's it looks amazing and i'm i'm really
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:45.400]   glad to see that there's more uh nerdery coming to close particularly for women uh so i'm
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:49.400]   really excited about like the her universe stuff made me very excited because i could buy a star
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:56.680]   wars shirt in a women's cut i didn't have to go buy kid shirts anymore and uh just seeing that more
[01:59:56.680 --> 02:00:03.160]   people are recognizing that there are women who want skirts that want clothes that light up and you
[02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:09.240]   know then making them awesome and you know also like making star wars action figures that are freely
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:13.160]   available you know when it so happens that the main character in a star wars movie is female maybe
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:17.880]   you should make sure that people can buy those toys too and so that's uh my picks for today
[02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:24.280]   yeah it's it's amazing that the biggest movie of that genre of the entire year and they didn't
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:29.720]   have an action figure of the lead character and and say the same thing with the avengers movie
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:34.600]   where the only action figure you could not get was the black widow and i'm sure that's i'm sure
[02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:39.640]   that sexism did not play a role in that choice iron man three when they changed the villain for
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:46.600]   toy sales not not Jim i did but before you we get to your pick can i borrow your skirt on the
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:52.040]   alternate weekends when you're not using it i really like that that's a good yeah
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:01:00.520]   what do you got for us this i killed so i don't know if i can do it without you know trying to beat
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:08.360]   Renee with all his sound effects you know i i always do music and you know lots of guitar
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:12.600]   with no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no taptic stuff though
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:23.160]   so i'm going to pick a band called clutch great band and and typical of the type of bands that i
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:34.520]   listen to a lot um kind of hard rock but bluesy and um the the psychic warfare album it's it's on
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:42.040]   apple music all other stuff it's on apple music just a tremendous band if you if you just there's
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:51.880]   nothing fancy it's just straight ahead uh really good bluesy rock um so i i really enjoy them i i
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:56.840]   think that they they do a phenomenal job and i've seen them live a couple of times
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:04.280]   um they put on a great show but again it's just it's very straight ahead type music you know there's
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:13.560]   nothing fancy they just do their thing and go and it's it's wonderful very very cool now i have my
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:19.960]   my pick is a little bit different um a lot of people do what i do yet you have a need for a
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:24.600]   terabyte of storage or 500 gigabytes of storage but we're not talking about live storage where it's
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:30.680]   where your your photo library is going to live for for a project we're talking about you've got
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:35.880]   lots of cruft in your hard drive and you just need to move some files off and back them up and just
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:41.800]   put them elsewhere and so that's why a lot of people like me uh they will just like buy a raw you
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:47.880]   know a raw hard drive dirt dirt cheap without even bothering to buy the wrapped it in enclosure
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:56.040]   and you have even not even a transport as as fancy as this this one has uh SATA it has
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:00.920]   firewire it has usb it has everything and then you just you know it mounts like any other hard
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:06.440]   drive you format it and then when you're done with it you if you're me you're like oh now it's
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:11.960]   all exposed and stuff okay i'll find a manila envelope that i can label and put it in a file
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:17.240]   folder and every time and i know that you can buy like special hard plastic cases for these
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:24.120]   but every time i'd look on amazon or whatever for them they'd be like for people who have a budget
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:29.240]   and they're being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for this gig and the people who make
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:34.440]   these plastic boxes know that and they know that i bet they'll pay 13 dollars for that i bet i
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:39.160]   bet if they're billing this all to the client there's no need for us to not set our hot fire for for
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:44.200]   us not to have a jacuzzi next to the hot tub in the place we're building let's charge them an armor
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:51.160]   leg but then it went on ebay and found these just cheap simple little plastic boxes this
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:54.440]   could cost like a buck and a half each i bought they actually just arrived this morning i just
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:04:00.200]   bought like a whole big bag of them uh and so this is exactly what i needed it's just a simple
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:07.640]   plastic box uh and all you got to do again i'm just using it for the first time you undo
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:12.120]   there you go you undo this clip it flips open you slide the i got in there
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:19.320]   you flip the top back closed and voila your drive is nicely protected and against dust and
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:23.400]   fingerprints and stuff like that and obviously you're not going to frisbee it but you're responsible
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:28.120]   adults you're not going to frisbee it anyway uh but the great thing is that for this price i can
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:33.560]   protect every one of these uh every one of these drives i've got so many now i just bought a dozen
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:38.600]   because again they're literally like a buck and a half each they only took like a week to get here
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:44.360]   by packet delivery from china uh but i also suicide of extras there are times when you're sort of
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:49.640]   helping out friends with uh problems or having with their machines and sometimes you do have to
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:56.120]   tell them that the best way to get your son's computer up and running so he can go to college
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:01.880]   in two days is to just swap out the hard drive that has been shattered with a new one and sometimes
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:06.440]   you want to send them back home with uh with parts and so i just have this for buck and a half go
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:11.400]   ahead you can keep the case i i just think it's looks really nice and once again the these raw
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:17.240]   these these drive mechanisms these notebook mechanisms as cheap as your base it for the price
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:26.280]   that you would pay for a low speed usb 2.0 drive in a pocket drive in an enclosure you can get a high
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:33.320]   speed uh one and then you'll plug it into this and you'll be able to get access it at the usb 3.0
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:38.280]   and again assuming that you're not what you're not going to need to travel from your to albacurki
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:44.760]   to sacramento to a high one back again for that you do want to self-contained drive i think but for
[02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:49.000]   this solution it lets you save money get the better hard drives and still have the protection
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:54.120]   that you need so i did paste in a link but that was sort of arbitrary it was just hey look for
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:58.840]   for a buck and a half i'm willing to take a gamble and they really did come out really really nice
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:05.800]   i'm now i am a big fan of cheap plastic chinese boxes in general you will find bags with them because
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:11.640]   it turns out that if you uh i don't know if i showed you this i'll wind this up but uh this is
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:19.720]   this is the box of dongles that uh that is in my backpack in my laptop bag wherever i go it is
[02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:26.600]   every dongle i need to have handy just in case i'm going to need to uh communicate
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:33.560]   and do do anything i had this out because i needed to have the the ethernet adapter and the usb
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:40.280]   adapter for my ipad and i used to have these in just random kind of little bags and i found you know
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:44.920]   what i know what i need i need a little plastic clear box about the size of an altoids case but
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:50.280]   thicker and if you pretty much type in those search terms in ebay you will find a chinese
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:55.400]   site that's selling cheap little plastic see-through boxes about the sides of an altoids box only
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:07:00.440]   thicker so really great solution specifically these are great but anytime you find that i really
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:06.360]   wish there was a little box that would have that would hold uh just my charge my uh my ipad charger
[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:11.720]   and a cable you will be able to find that uh and dirt cheap too and you'll be helping the economy
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:19.560]   of one of our financial uh competitors so whatever i mean you'll have the plastic box and that's really
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:25.640]   all that matters that's going to be it for uh mac break weekly this week uh first let's say goodbye
