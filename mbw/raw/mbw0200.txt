[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.160]   How did this happen?
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.520]   Joining me now around the table, Fred Rick Van Johnson.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   Hello, Fred.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.080]   He's a high-LPR40 with custom pop filter, which you could see
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.880]   I lack.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.880]   Also joining us on his new PR40.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.640]   Mr. Andy Enovko.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.880]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.480]   Yes, I feel more professional now,
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480]   although with this much presence on the microphone,
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.440]   I almost feel as though I need to take down
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.720]   my own enthusiasm level.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.680]   You sound so NPR.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840]   And we're going into some tips right now.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.280]   And now in a dingy motel room somewhere in the South Bay.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.880]   I'm actually in the San Jose Convention Center.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.280]   Salesforce is doing their new chatter launch, which
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.440]   is kind of their Facebook for business.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.320]   And we're streaming it right now upstairs.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.560]   And I found a quiet place that I can do this while the other guys
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.680]   are actually doing some work.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.160]   OK.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.880]   You do sound like you're at the bottom of a salt mine,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.040]   because everybody else has a PR40, and you have just a headset.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.920]   I have some serious mic envy.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.560]   Really, with the background and the audio,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.760]   it really does look like Alex.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.080]   You're about to show that your hostages are still alive.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   Just hold up today's newspaper, and we'll know it's true.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.440]   I want to 747.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.680]   And I went on no brown eggs and any supermarket in the San Jose
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.680]   San Francisco, Olkin, Nemdasino, or others in the Trelton areas.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.440]   And I only want it half full of fuel.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.040]   What?
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.000]   Oh, really?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.920]   Oh, yeah, don't ask.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.320]   I want tickets to the World Cup.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.760]   Yes.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.920]   That's what I want.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.080]   But only the finals.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.640]   Only the finals.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.680]   And no kazoos, please.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.240]   They're not kazoos.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.240]   If we would ever--
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240]   They sound like kazoos.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.720]   They'd kill me.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.800]   They do sound like kazoos.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.960]   Somebody sending me one from South Africa.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.680]   Actually played at a plate, if that's the word you use.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.920]   At a World Cup game, so I'm very much looking forward to that.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.200]   Is she going to pull it out of the butt of the person that got it
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.960]   rammed in there by an ivory fellow family?
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.000]   They keep saying this is like a traditional South African soccer.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.440]   We had those when I was a kid.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   Exactly.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.520]   And our parents were smarter than saying, OK, that's
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.880]   being thrown out of the car on the way back from the parade.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.160]   You're not getting this back.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.760]   Exactly.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.640]   Enough, right?
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.080]   Enough.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.520]   We had them, but we called them horns.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.360]   We didn't have a fancy name, the vuvuzela.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.480]   We didn't have a fancy name.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.880]   They just called them annoying.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.400]   Jaws.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.880]   They're just--
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.400]   They're just--
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.920]   Oh my god.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.720]   So I guess there's really one big story today.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.520]   And that is that day after tomorrow, Thursday morning, 7 AM,
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.560]   Apple Store's open.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.480]   I presume-- and I don't know.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.240]   Maybe you guys know that this means also Radio Shack, Best
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.440]   by Walmart.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.520]   And who else?
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.400]   I'm leaving somebody else.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   Oh, AT&T, I've heard of them.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.920]   We'll be opening their doors presumably early.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.120]   I don't know how that's going to work.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.320]   The deal is if you were one of the lucky few who
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.880]   got through on Monday, last Monday, one of the 600,000 lucky few.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.920]   I did not.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.400]   And I came back Tuesday and found out
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   I wouldn't get my phone to the July 15.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.360]   But if you got in on Monday, you had two choices.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.000]   You could buy it for delivery on Thursday.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.240]   And folks, enough with the stories
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.080]   that Apple said it's going to come today, liars.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.120]   It's not going to come today.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.360]   Apple does this every time.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.040]   You will watch.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.520]   There'll be a magic hold put on your phone.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.120]   And it will arrive Thursday with everybody else's.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.280]   What is nice is at least they're making sure
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.120]   that it really is going to arrive on that day.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.000]   That's the thing that always makes me nervous about ordering
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.200]   online is I feel like I'm going to be going somewhere.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.480]   I really want it that day.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.840]   And so that takes some of the pressure off.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.200]   They've done very well with this.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.040]   They did that for the iPad launch.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.960]   And I remember getting that email saying, oh, yeah,
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.360]   it's going to arrive three days early.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.920]   And of course, they hold it.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.520]   They did it with a last 3GS.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.080]   That's how I got my 3GS.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.200]   Why would somebody--
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.480]   I mean, what is the reasoning, because you
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.360]   like to wait in line that you would say, I'll go pick it up.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.120]   You don't trust it'll arrive.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.520]   Do you want something people could get it?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.040]   Right.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.560]   Go ahead.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.280]   Sorry, Fred.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.440]   You want the experience, Fred?
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.480]   Yeah, I was going to say people like that the camaraderie
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.120]   of waiting in line and being beat over the head with, hey,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.200]   you might get something cool at the end of this wait.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.160]   I don't know.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.200]   For me, as I get older, I'm getting more into the--
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.920]   I'm going to let the fools rush in and get theirs.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.960]   And then I'm just going to wait.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.720]   Even though I have to wait because I didn't get mine early.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.160]   But I'm OK with my iOS 4 on my 3GS.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.120]   And I'm just going to hold out and wait for mine to show up
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.440]   one day.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.640]   When it does, I'll be happy.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.480]   But I don't need it right now, is what I'm saying.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.980]   What?
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.480]   I think it has more to do with some people just
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.900]   don't want to have to wait at home all day long for the truck
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.840]   that's going to come.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.640]   Because you talk about the heartbreak.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.680]   When you see the post at note, because you walk your dog
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.840]   for five minutes, then that's when UPS came and tried
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.920]   to deliver your absolutely wonderful new toy.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.280]   But if you're really committed to the iPhone,
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.680]   you will stay home all day.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.840]   Come on.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.600]   Oh, yes.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.640]   That's a lack of commitment.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.320]   I'm sensing.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.160]   iOS flu is going to be sweeping.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.480]   Most tech sectors do not try to get tech support for anything
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.920]   before 1 PM.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.320]   I'm somebody's telling me, iPhone repair,
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.160]   who is just north of here, is saying some people have already
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.400]   got them.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.800]   Mm.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.080]   Really?
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.560]   I think it makes sense.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.960]   I would say that for Apple's point of view,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.840]   it really makes sense for people to get it.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.600]   If you order it online, you actually
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.880]   get it before everybody else.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.800]   Because then that would push a lot more people online,
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   put a lot less pressure.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.960]   I guess maybe that was a mistake.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.960]   No, that's exactly what they--
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.600]   No one.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.400]   All right.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.600]   So according to Engadget, which has a picture--
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   so I guess it must be true--
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.440]   iPhones are, in fact, starting to arrive now.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.720]   Well, Apple Insider had a story about some people getting
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.280]   an email from Apple that not only said,
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.680]   you'll be getting yours on the 23rd,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.000]   but also reiterated twice that you might see later shipping
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.520]   dates and other pieces of information.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.080]   We promise you that will be available.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.760]   That will be arriving on the 23rd.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.400]   So check the delivery site and plan accordingly,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.680]   if you need to be home to sign for it.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.600]   I haven't checked it since.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.800]   I saw this story this morning.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   I haven't checked it out myself.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.680]   Somebody on Mac Rumors says he's got his eye--
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.200]   [SIGHS]
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.400]   Well, man, there's pictures.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   They got the pictures to prove it.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.000]   All these stories just hurt me, you know,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.360]   because I want mine right now.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.400]   So here it is from Apple Mojo.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.600]   He posted this at 1.09 PM his time.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.080]   I don't know why.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.600]   Maybe that's like an hour ago.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.400]   FedEx just dropped off my app-- and by the way,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.080]   we're recording this on Tuesday, the 22nd.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.440]   FedEx just dropped my iPhone for just a few months ago.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.720]   Activation was snapping smoothly.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.520]   Of course, you're one of three people who has one.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.440]   Impressively cool FYI, as of last night before bed,
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.880]   my delivery date was still the 24th.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.560]   Somebody screwed up, I think.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.760]   Well, also, keep an eye on those square corners and sharp edges.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.920]   This is going to be the easiest one to model in SketchUp ever.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.840]   So if you want to see like King John,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.280]   you'll not hit his weak girl lead.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.920]   That's the exam of the pixels on that shot.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.680]   It's King John.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.880]   I like it.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.680]   So how many of you have installed iOS 4 on your 3GS?
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.080]   I guess that's the question I should ask,
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.400]   because that did come out yesterday.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.120]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.600]   Lovely, lovely, lovely.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.840]   I'm trying to figure out if it's--
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.120]   I have-- unfortunately, I only have one 3GS.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.920]   So I've been trying to figure out if this is actually faster.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.840]   In addition to all the other features that have been listed,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   if it's actually faster than the stock 3GS.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.080]   Because it feels a lot snappier.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.880]   Interesting.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.600]   Well, why not?
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.040]   I mean, you could make the software be more efficient, right?
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.920]   And already, it's changed the way that I use the iPhone.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.960]   Rest the springboard screens to be the home position of where
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.960]   you go, the concierge to the entire experience.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.960]   Now it is the application switcher, because after using it
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.520]   for about an hour, you find that all the applications that you
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.240]   commonly use anyway, those icons are just right there
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.920]   in the app switcher.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.640]   So there's almost never an excuse to go back into springboard
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.480]   anymore.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.400]   And I really think that your 20 minutes spent in the iTunes
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.280]   application organizer creating new folders
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.160]   and just burying every single icon after page 2 in a folder
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.480]   is going to be time really well spent.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.280]   I'm really pleased with iPhone 4.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.600]   So will you do everything in a folder
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.120]   and just have like two pages of applications?
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.160]   I really do think so.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.560]   It's solved one of the biggest problems
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.480]   that I've always had with the iPhone, which is that you just
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.040]   have to go page after page after page after page
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.440]   and try to keep track of where you're organizing these things.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.920]   There's no way to name a page so you
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.840]   don't know where it's going.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.320]   Exactly.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.760]   It just gives you a level of control.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.840]   But in terms of like one line sort of comments about iOS 4,
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.800]   I was making jokes back in Macworld in February
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.680]   trying to push my iPhone book at my publisher's booth
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.680]   about how this is the first book to cover the iPad Nano.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.600]   Everything you need to know about the iPad Nano,
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.840]   getting the most out of your iPad Nano with all the secrets
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.000]   in this book, iPhone fully loaded.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.440]   And really, after using iOS 4, I really
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.440]   think that it does turn an iPhone into an iPad Nano.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.640]   There's so many of the features that I really, really
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.920]   like about the iPad from simple things
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.720]   like being able to use a Bluetooth keyboard
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.840]   to more complicated things like being
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.560]   able to email yourself a file as an attachment
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.760]   and then have mail open it in a specific other application
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.480]   and then have the application be able to edit it
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.240]   and save it in its own storage space.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.400]   That really elevates what you can do with an iPhone.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.440]   Now correctly, you might say that these are things
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.360]   you could do in a Sony RX and phone five years ago,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.640]   but it's Apple and they're doing it a different way
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.000]   and a better way and it's Apple.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.120]   It's Apple, shut up, shut up.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.800]   It's Apple, it means it's better.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.240]   So yeah, Apple is sending out an email.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.840]   I'm seeing us now on Engadget that
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.560]   says you recently received a shipment notification
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.360]   from Apple advising you your phone has shipped
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.480]   this email to confirm delivery will occur
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.880]   on June 23rd, Wednesday, a day before it's available
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.780]   in the stores.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.800]   So this does, you're right, Alex, this kind of
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.160]   indicates that maybe they would be pushing people
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.360]   to order online and get them out of the stores.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.040]   Although the line experience is an experience.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.840]   - I think it was an experience and I think it was
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.360]   an important part of their progression,
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.440]   but I think at this point it requires some,
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.200]   I mean, it's so much setup for every Apple store
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.720]   and the reality is that it's not generating more.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.480]   I mean, it is generating some excitement,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.040]   but it's not generating more revenue
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.640]   and it does, it kind of blocks up the whole store.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.480]   - That's true.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   - You know, it's a very expensive--
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.320]   - As long as there are iPad sales.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.840]   - They're opening early so that's, you know,
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.720]   when you're talking about thousands and thousands
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.200]   of employees coming in three hours early
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.840]   and then all the planning beforehand
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.800]   and then all the extra man hours and all the other things,
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.400]   you know, it turns into a lot of money
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.800]   that Apple's spending on just excitement.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.320]   The question is they already kind of have that now.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.680]   It's not clear whether they need it
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.200]   and it seems like it'd be much more efficient
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.360]   for them to keep on moving people towards,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.760]   you know, just go online, just handle it there.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.200]   - Well, if you're watching live
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.880]   and you're in the Petaluma area,
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.040]   you have one hour to bring us your iPhone 4.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.440]   (laughing)
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.080]   You've already got one.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.880]   - Or else we kill a hostage, right Alex?
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.720]   (laughing)
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.880]   - Yes, bring the little girl to the camera.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.200]   - You're just making Frederick and me feel worse
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.760]   because we aren't gonna get ours now.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.160]   I mean, if we had managed to get in on Monday.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.480]   - Mm-hmm, yeah.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   - I'm looking at my screen now.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.320]   - I'm always too.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.080]   - I'm flipping July 2nd for delivery, July 6th to July 8th.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.440]   - I'm in the same boat.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.000]   - Yeah, so it means I have to listen to all these reviews
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.480]   and all these people with their phones
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.880]   until at the latest July 8th.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.240]   - But you are gonna upgrade to OS 4, right?
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.400]   - I have, I have upgraded it.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   And I agree with Andy.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.560]   I'm, and I may, I may, I hated paging through app pages
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.400]   and pages of apps.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.840]   So I have two screens.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.360]   I have one with all my apps on it, you know,
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.480]   the ones that I use every day and then another screen
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.400]   of nested apps.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.000]   And, you know, I'm happy with that.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.760]   So I was just two screens back and forth.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.160]   And if I really can't find something,
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.720]   I'll just dive into the, you know,
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.520]   into the search and dig for it that way.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.720]   So it's a much easier way to use the phone.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.120]   And like, you know, Andy, I agree with you.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.000]   It has changed the way that I'm using my phone
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.240]   and I cannot wait.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   It's almost painful to go from iOS 4 to the iPad now
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.360]   because now I have pages and pages of apps there.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.960]   And, you know, there's that disconnect.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.280]   So we won't get the iPad till this fall for some reason.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.120]   I know.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.640]   So I have to deal with that, you know?
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.360]   - How about the multitasking guys?
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.280]   - It's hard to test because--
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.240]   - I've tried Pandora, but I haven't, you know, it,
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.080]   I don't know.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.640]   Alex, you tell me, I haven't really,
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.440]   it hasn't really kicked in for me.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.840]   You know, what the multitasking--
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.600]   - It's not really multitasking.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.480]   - Well, so what would we-- - Yeah, multi-positive.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.560]   - Okay.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.280]   - None of it is real multitasking.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.960]   I think that the number one line
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.400]   in all these mobile operating systems is to say that
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.720]   none of no mobile operating system multitasks
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.040]   in quite the same way that most users expect
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.560]   multitasking to work on a desktop.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.200]   It's always a way of, it's always a little bit of a shell
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.600]   game and a little bit of an illusion
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.240]   that you have all these applications totally active
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.560]   and totally alive in the background
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.600]   doing lots of productive things while you're using,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.000]   using the web browser or using mail.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.440]   Unfortunately, there just aren't a whole lot of apps out there
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.400]   in the App Store right now that can really exploit
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.600]   not just multitasking, but I, basic iOS 4 features.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.080]   Pandora is the one that I think Apple must have helped
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.680]   them a little bit 'cause that's the one app
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.680]   that was definitely out the door on day one.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.040]   And it does work really well.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.600]   In that, well, what do you know for the first time
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.160]   in the life of this device, Pandora Music does indeed
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.680]   keep playing.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.600]   The iPhone is not screwing me as it usually does
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   out of Pandora Music.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.200]   The really cool thing is gonna happen when we do,
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.040]   when we have things like Flickr uploaders
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.760]   where we can simply say, please upload these nine pictures.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:57.200]   Right, then we use the ability to keep a thread open
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.160]   and simply say, I know that you're closing me down
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.120]   but keep this one thread open and then notify
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.480]   when the thread is done.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.360]   That's when we're really gonna start to think
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.880]   whether or not this is a reusable thing or not.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.040]   I mean, there are, I would disagree that
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.760]   there are true multitasking operating systems.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.600]   I know this piece of crap, no kid, no 900,
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.400]   which I'm using is multitasking 'cause it's MAMO.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.320]   And I'm pretty sure the Android's multitasking.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.360]   In fact, one of the things that kills the Android battery
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.280]   is Google talk in the background,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.920]   which is always checking to see if anybody's chatting with you.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.080]   But there's always a certain level of the operating system
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.400]   having the power to decide that this app doesn't seem
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.240]   to be doing very much, so I'm just simply gonna suspend
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.960]   all those operations for now.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.280]   So it's not gonna be in the same sense of a desktop
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.120]   where if you run an app, it doesn't need to be specifically
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.680]   set up for multitasking, it just simply runs sticks
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.240]   and does whatever it has to do in the background,
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.200]   grabbing however many duty cycles.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.680]   Yeah, I think that, you know, actually,
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.040]   having looked at the Android SDK,
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.680]   they do it quite intelligently, which is that you can
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.280]   remain in the background until your resources are needed,
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.160]   but everybody understands that a mobile platform
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   has less memory, less CPU, and so has to have the ability
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.240]   to say, "No, no, I'm sorry, you can't keep running
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.460]   in the background, we got other things
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.080]   that we're doing here."
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.480]   And to Android's credit, it's not that Apple makes
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.080]   a big deal about how they did it this way,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.440]   because if you don't do it this way,
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.320]   you're gonna drop power, if you don't do it this way,
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.640]   it's gonna destabilize the platform.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.400]   And even when I was trying really hard to destroy
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.200]   my Android's battery with background processes,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.080]   the worst thing you can say about it is that
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.760]   all these background processes just make your battery life
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.240]   awesomely unpredictable.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.400]   Right, that's exactly right.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.600]   I mean, I do like the fact that on other platforms,
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.520]   I can count on getting three and a half hours
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.960]   of really heavy use out of it.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.240]   There have been times when I forgot to close a certain thing
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.920]   or I should have forced quitted something,
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.840]   and then, sure enough, 45 minutes later,
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.600]   I'm at like 10%, I have to shut it down
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.440]   so I can make a phone call three hours later,
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.480]   which is kind of a problem, a bit of inconvenient.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.920]   I'm really curious about iPhone for battery life,
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.160]   'cause they don't make a big deal,
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.520]   they say more talk time,
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.200]   they didn't make a big deal about more battery life,
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.560]   but it sounds like more battery life,
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.720]   and a faster processor, which nobody's really
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.280]   talking a lot about, but it's the same as the iPad processor,
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.760]   that should make a big difference.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.160]   - During the keynote, they did have a whole screen
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.360]   up there for battery life.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.040]   I think they were saying something about,
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.120]   across the board, something about 10% to 15%
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.360]   greater battery life, nothing spectacular,
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.480]   but at least enough to convince you
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.720]   that you weren't gonna be paying a really bad battery life
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.240]   price in this huge display,
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.480]   in this more powerful processing.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.280]   - And I think that the RAM is gonna make a big difference.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.120]   I mean, that's why-- - 512 meg, twice
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.640]   what the iPad has.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.040]   - Yes, and that kind of, you know,
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.800]   we're back when we had G3s and G4s,
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.600]   the reason that G3s were going so much faster than the G4s
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.840]   was a larger L2 cache,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.760]   no, it's not exactly the same, but RAM is always
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.080]   one of the cheapest ways to speed up an operating system
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.840]   because it just gives it a lot more to work with,
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.320]   it's not constantly checking stuff in and out,
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.800]   and I think that's gonna make a big difference.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.880]   I think we're gonna see some of the performance there,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.240]   and especially it also means when you're talking about
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.160]   games and so on and so forth,
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.360]   it'll affect the number of texture maps that can be loaded,
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.040]   the number of, you know, there's a lot of things
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.920]   that that type of thing, you know,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.200]   how much, what can be cashed up.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.720]   - Yeah, and video editing and photo editing
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.840]   is what I'm most looking forward to,
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.760]   is being able to actually edit high definition video
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.080]   with all the-- - In your camera?
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.720]   - In your phone, you wanna do that, huh?
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.840]   - Yeah, I totally wanna do that.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.520]   - Mark, you imagine you're on a trip somewhere
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.680]   and you wanna put together just,
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.760]   you just wanna put together a podcast or something,
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.000]   you could do it, right from your phone,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.400]   that's mind boggling.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.800]   - I have to say, I shoot tons and tons and tons of videos,
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.640]   like I just have these funny little videos I shoot at NAB,
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.720]   and then also the stuff I shoot in Africa,
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.160]   and what slows them down from me posting them is that,
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.680]   there's a little mess on the front and the back,
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   or there's a little bit of a mess,
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.240]   or there's some stuff I'd like to cut out in the middle,
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.400]   and I go, "Oh, I'm gonna cut that out,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.640]   "I'm gonna put it on my computer,
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.280]   "and then I'll do it, and then I'll upload it."
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.640]   And if I could just do it right there,
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.560]   like I just wanna snip this out right here,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.760]   or I wanna snip something out real quickly,
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.280]   being able to do that really quickly
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.360]   and easily on my phone, I think,
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.120]   from a newscaster's perspective,
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.480]   from someone who's blogging.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.680]   - Well, we'll see, it'd be interesting,
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.920]   suddenly all of a sudden we're seeing a lot
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.800]   of edited in the phone stuff.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.640]   - Yeah.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.800]   - From the point of view,
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.960]   but can you use iMovie on a 3GS,
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.840]   or does it, you have to have a fork to do the iMovie?
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.800]   - Four, four, only have to have a hardware.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.200]   - And I think that's part of the ramp.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.040]   I think that's an issue of--
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.040]   - Scram also, sure, sure, sure, sure.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.240]   Yeah, sorry, that's wrong.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.800]   No, what is it?
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.360]   - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I misspoke.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.320]   I said it was part of the OS,
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.680]   obviously it isn't, it's something you have to purchase
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.760]   my bike stick. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.880]   It's five bucks, right, something like that.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.080]   And you do purchase it, but okay,
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.920]   so that was the question.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.680]   So you do need the new hardware.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.520]   And you know what, it makes sense,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.720]   you need 512 makes a ram.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   I mean, it's kind of amazing to think how little ram--
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.560]   - Well, I mean--
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.960]   - This, by the way, I was thinking about this last night.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   When you're talking about computers,
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.800]   Max or PCs, you always talk about how much ram,
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.040]   how much ram to get,
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.920]   you always talk about this, you know,
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.240]   processor speed and things like that.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.640]   And as we get to with both the iPad and the iPhone
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.080]   and appliance computer, it's no longer,
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.680]   nobody knows that the iPad has 256 megs of ram.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.920]   I didn't know until I was reading the iPhone 4 reviews.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.080]   It doesn't matter, does it work?
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.560]   Yes, so then you don't care anymore, it's an appliance.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.400]   - I think for the type of--
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.520]   - They don't talk about, they don't want to get into numbers,
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.800]   they want to get into features.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.720]   And no one really cares about how much memory it has,
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.760]   they care about how fast it is,
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.120]   how responsible-- - And I've made this now.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.960]   - A little absolute run.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.000]   - It's analogy before, but that is a sign of maturing
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.520]   of the industry, it's something happened with the stereo
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.720]   industry in the early days of High Fire,
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.280]   everybody's talking about total watts RMS per channel
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.040]   and you know, how much distortion and blah, blah, blah.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.080]   And the music was secondary for the High Fireheads,
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.560]   it was all about speeds and feeds,
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.880]   then content started to take over.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.400]   And nobody now talks about total watts RMS per channel.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.280]   It's about the content and that's what's happening now
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.200]   with the computer industry and that I think
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.560]   is a sign of a maturing industry,
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.360]   an industry that people, real people use,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.080]   are not enthusiasts.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.240]   - Well, and I think also that when you're not talking,
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.280]   today, I mean, this changed over the last five
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   or six years, but today if you're not doing video,
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.880]   if you're not doing 3D, if you're not doing scientific
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.480]   heavy calculations, you know, anything that you buy,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.040]   all of these things are plenty fast to run
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.120]   just about anything that the average person's gonna use.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.600]   Those trucks are only necessary for the larger operations
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.000]   today. - The trucks, that's Steve Jobs analogy.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   - The one we see is our trucks.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.400]   What about iPhone updating?
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.880]   Apparently there are two ways the iPhone can be updated.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.960]   The simplest is to do a direct update.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.200]   Tell me if I'm wrong, I'm reading this
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.800]   from the unofficial Apple web log.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.920]   Apparently some people might've had trouble updating
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.920]   on a 3G to the iOS 4, not 3GS, 3G, it's a big update.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:35.360]   You could do the update button on the devices information
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.520]   page and iTunes or simply letting iTunes continue
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.520]   with an upgrade when it automatically detects.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.280]   The other option is of course to do a full restore.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.800]   And apparently in some cases the update in place
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.040]   is not as, it will get stuck on a 3G
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.240]   and you'd be better to do a full restore.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.000]   And Frederick or Andy or Alex, if you had trouble
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.680]   with the, I haven't done an update, my 3GS is lost.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   - Mine, I've actually failed.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.040]   - The update for some of you has failed downloading
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.000]   to iTunes three times now.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.360]   - How big is it?
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.600]   - It's got 374 max.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.040]   - Geez, Louise.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.760]   - And it's failed three times and I don't know exactly why.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.440]   It gets a certain distance and then it just stops.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.120]   And so hopefully sometimes today I'll get it.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.080]   And it's different places, it's not like the same place.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.760]   So I'm not sure whether it's my connectivity,
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.920]   whether it's, I've been in three different places doing it.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.600]   So it's not the same network, but every single time
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.480]   it gets certain point I seem to have a connection
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.720]   but it's not downloaded anymore.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.080]   - I suspect that's just 'cause a lot of people
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.880]   are downloading it all at once, right?
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.680]   - Yeah, I updated mine last night
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.960]   and it went flawlessly, I gotta say.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.760]   It just zoomed right in there.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.200]   I docked the iPod.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.960]   - You didn't do a restore, you just did the regular update.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.200]   - I did the regular update, yeah.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.280]   And I left the house and came back and it was ready to go.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.240]   But one thing I will say, I will say,
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.080]   when I was playing around joyously nesting folders,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.880]   the device seemed to heat up.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.320]   I got really noticeably hot in my hand
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.280]   and then it froze.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.120]   Then I restarted it and it's been fine since.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.520]   But that was kind of weird.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.360]   TUAW is saying that 3G users should do a restore.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.200]   And of course, you sync before you do the restore
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.080]   so you're not gonna lose anything, it'll all back right up.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.600]   I think it restores, like a clean install,
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.160]   it's probably a better idea in general
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:29.040]   on any machine, on any computer, including a phone.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.640]   - It's also a good idea if you wanna use the new
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.240]   encrypt all contents feature.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.480]   - Ah, that's cool.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.440]   - Because you can't do that institute,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.320]   you have to obviously start up by removing everything
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.720]   off the device and then re-incrypting it
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.000]   and then putting it back on.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.400]   It's a very simple process, but if you don't do a restore,
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.600]   it's not gonna work that way.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.640]   - Computer World is pointing out that as part of the iOS
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.960]   for upgrade Apple patch 65 vulnerabilities
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.200]   on the iPhone, half of them critical.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.880]   I guess they didn't wanna release their patching them.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.720]   - Yeah.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.160]   (sighs)
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.640]   - You need to hear about those after though.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.200]   - Well, and if you have a really old iPhone,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.680]   the 2007 iPhone or iPod Touch or an iPad,
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.480]   you have to say, hmm.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.280]   (laughs)
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.280]   Hmm, what are those 32.5 critical vulnerabilities
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.840]   that I should be aware of?
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.280]   35 bugs, 54% of the total were tagged with the phrase,
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.240]   tagged with the phrase arbitrary code execution.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.520]   Does anybody else listen to security now
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.960]   or Steve Gibson at any time knows
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.760]   that arbitrary code execution is not good?
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.400]   That is a series you could be used to hijack your phone.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.280]   This is something we did,
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.200]   there's not talked a lot about,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.840]   but as phones turn into computers,
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.360]   they're gonna have the same vulnerabilities,
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.800]   they're gonna be air to the same vulnerabilities
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.560]   computers are air to, yes?
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.120]   - You guys are scaring me, I'm gonna re-
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:51.960]   - You better update.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.760]   - You better store, you better update it.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.840]   Fred, what are you doing?
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.080]   What are you crazy?
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.000]   - You better send me your iPhone and your iPad,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.840]   Fred, right?
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.960]   - Good thing they're in mail now.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.040]   - I'll send you my Kindle.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.880]   How's that?
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.000]   (laughs)
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.040]   Since now we were with 189 dollars per hour.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.400]   - Did you see the price war that's going on?
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.840]   - That's, no, that's the Apple Ripple effect,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.880]   both Amazon Kindle reader and the Barnes and Noble Nook
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.160]   are in a race to the bottom,
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.920]   to 189 for the Kindle, 149 for the wifi only version
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   of the Nook.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.240]   That's just such great news just for e-publishing
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.680]   in general, because I think that was the magic price
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.680]   that everybody has been waiting for,
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.800]   not just the geeks who are really into this sort of stuff,
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.160]   but someone who wouldn't buy it for themselves,
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.400]   but 150 bucks is cheap enough that they might actually
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.160]   get one for their birthday or for Christmas,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.280]   and then that would be the last time
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.840]   they went up buying paper books.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.960]   That's a huge, huge thing.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.520]   - My wife is become a Kindle fanatic.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.040]   You know, I gave her my wifi iPad when I got the 3G.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.520]   She put it aside, and I also gave her the Kindle
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.440]   when I got my iPad, and she loves the Kindle,
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.040]   and she's buying books on the Kindle,
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.800]   and my mom who has an iPad still reads on the Kindle,
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.840]   so there's still a market for the e-ink screen.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.200]   People, there, a lot of people,
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.120]   especially if you're reading in light, in sunlight,
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.640]   want an e-ink screen.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.920]   - Yeah, is that the main reason,
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.520]   or if you're gonna read it in light,
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.000]   or, 'cause I, you know, once I got my iPad,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.480]   and I got the Kindle app installed on it,
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.080]   and all my books got sucked into it,
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.880]   I haven't, honestly, I don't even know
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.320]   if my Kindle is charged right now,
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.760]   so it's, you know, I don't see the reason to go back.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.560]   - I know that my Kindle DX is somewhere inside the office,
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.320]   or the bedroom, or the living room,
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.880]   or maybe the car, or maybe a piece of luggage
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.640]   from two months ago.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.240]   - Exactly. - I'm confident that I can,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.160]   I can say where it is within,
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.480]   let's say, a 40-yard radius of where I am right now.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.280]   Not within 30, but definitely within 40.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.200]   - I know within 40.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.560]   How big is your house?
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.840]   I think you could say, with some confidence
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.440]   that everything in your home is within 40 yards.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.120]   (laughing)
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.280]   - Unless you-- - I'm, I'm, I'll say that
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.480]   I'm pretty sure that if I left it in an airport,
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.560]   things would have been charged with by now for one mile.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.560]   - You know what's funny? - No, it's funny.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.160]   That was the first thing I thought would have happened
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.960]   when I lost my Kindle, I left it on the plane.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.760]   I waited to see if anybody buy a book,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.720]   and they didn't, so I don't know what happened with it.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.560]   - I don't know.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.280]   - I think that the issue is, for me,
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.560]   is it's not so much money, it's not so much the e-ink.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.400]   I think that the thing that I get concerned,
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.240]   it's just space.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.640]   I mean, it's just another thing I have to carry around.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.680]   If I'm gonna carry something around,
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   I just don't wanna carry it around a unit-tasker.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   You know, I just wanna, I want something that's gonna--
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.120]   - Ooh. - It's a unit-tasker.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.480]   - No money. - It is.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.840]   It's like a unit-tard.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.640]   It's like the worst thing you can have.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.480]   - It is.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.160]   - The thing is, it only does one thing.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.200]   I mean, you know, my phone now does a lot of things.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.800]   - Stupid lip balm, I can't get an email on this.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.640]   (laughing)
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.960]   - Oh, screw you, lip balm.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.720]   Screw you, lip balm.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.920]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.440]   What you can use, you know, you can use lip balm
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.440]   for a lot of things.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440]   (laughing)
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.640]   - It's a lip balm.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.600]   Is there anything it can't do?
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.800]   - I mean, that's the concern.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.520]   It's a big item to have, to only have one use
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.360]   in my backpack.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.160]   That's the thing that I have a problem with.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.800]   - The price drop, though, has to have been driven
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.640]   by the fact that Apple is starting to eat
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.520]   into their business a little bit with iBooks or no.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.920]   - I think it probably has to do with,
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.040]   it took a while for them to see what the iPad business
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.400]   is going to be like.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.560]   They weren't gonna do anything that was arbitrary
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.680]   or speculative.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.560]   Now that they have three months worth of data to see,
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.040]   here's how our business has been affected by the iPad.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.000]   Now we make our plans for the next two years starting now.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.840]   - Yeah.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.560]   - I think that's also the reason why we haven't seen
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.400]   these anywhere.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.240]   - Maybe they're dumping it.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.080]   Maybe, you know, there haven't rumors,
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.560]   there's a Kindle 2 just around the corner.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.640]   Maybe they're dumping them.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.240]   - Maybe, but it's just too smart for them
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.800]   to have a seriously sub $200 Kindle.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.640]   I think this is getting all your armies on the border
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.280]   for the Christmas season where they can say,
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.640]   we have the Kindle 2 that costs $289 and has a color screen,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.840]   it has all these other cool things.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.160]   And the 3G is always free, unlike with the iPad,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.320]   where it's 30 bucks a month.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.840]   And for those of you who are just getting into it,
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.880]   we also have the $150 model, or excuse me,
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   in case of the Kindle, the $189 model,
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.040]   which is a good way to get you introduced,
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.160]   introduced into the one wonderful world of giving us
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.000]   all your money for our books.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.760]   - I'm sorry, I meant the wonderful world of e-public.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.600]   The share, we'll talk about it.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.120]   - Is there a market over $300 with the iPad there?
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   I mean, can you make something?
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.000]   - No, no, no, not just iPads, but netbooks.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.440]   I mean, there's just too many things.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.400]   $300 is now expensive.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.520]   - Yeah, it's the ceiling now.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.480]   - Yeah, the big loser, I mean the sense of losing a war
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.120]   not being a bunch of losers is the people
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.080]   who are making the Alex e-reader,
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.440]   because it was an interesting idea,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.760]   the idea of having an e-ink screen up top
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.720]   and an Android sort of PDA sort of thing up down the bottom
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.840]   with a color screen that has a really good browser on it.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.000]   Interesting concept, but as soon as Apple announced
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.720]   a price of $500, the idea of this hybrid device
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.280]   that costs 400 bucks, because $400 is now
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.360]   pretty much the third rail.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.880]   If you step one toe over it, everyone has to start thinking,
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.440]   well, why don't I just wait another couple of months,
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   save another 100 bucks and get a real,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.120]   multi-touch, really cool computer that Stephen Colbert
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.480]   is using as opposed to having this odd hybrid
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.000]   sort of thing that's only black and white most of the time.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.200]   - Lots to talk about, lots more to talk about,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.320]   and we will in just a little bit,
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.880]   but before we get too much farther,
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.240]   I know there are a few of you who are saying,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.040]   I want the new iPhone, but how am I gonna pay for it?
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.960]   And I've got a solution for you, it's Gazelle.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.640]   Gazelle, don't just sell it, Gazelle,
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.320]   get some cash to pay for your new iPhone
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.440]   when you sell your old one at Gazelle.com/iPhone.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.880]   If you go there right now, Gazelle.com/iPhone,
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.680]   you could select your, they have a special page just for it.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.680]   You know, the amazing thing is you can get,
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   you can almost certainly get that 200 bucks that you would need
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.720]   unless you have a really old or beat up iPhone.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.400]   Go to Gazelle.com/iPhone,
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   you're gonna select, wait a minute, wait a minute,
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.160]   wait a minute, hold on.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.720]   - I am rather Gazelle like that.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.080]   - You are Gazelle like, that's not the shot I was looking for.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.200]   There it is, and I don't know why it's a double box.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.280]   For those of you listening,
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.360]   pay no attention to the idiot behind the camera.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.480]   Gazelle.com/iPhone there it is,
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.760]   get cash for your phone so you select your model.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.200]   Hey, trade in now, first thousand customers
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.560]   get a ZAG iPhone screen protector, that's cool.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.320]   2G, 4 or 8 gigs or 16, so you could,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.720]   I have the 3GS32 gigabyte, that's the,
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.280]   yeah, I would if Abby hadn't lost it,
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.160]   let's just see how much Abby cost me.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.640]   Makes a call successfully, yes, free of water damage,
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.480]   well, it was when we lost it.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.840]   Perfect, now let's say good condition.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.160]   AC adapter, original cables and they will pay me $189.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.880]   Now they send you a box, you put it in the box,
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.960]   they get your iPhone, they check it out,
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.280]   make sure it matches your specs, and then you get paid.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.560]   You could select the payment,
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.760]   the method you want, by the way, PayPal, check,
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.440]   or get a Amazon gift card, you'll get a 5% bonus,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.560]   or get a Walmart gift card,
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:38.000]   just bring it down to use, get the phone at Walmart.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.800]   You could also donate your phone to charity,
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.320]   and I like this is one of the thing Gazelle does,
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.160]   I think it's really, really cool.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.680]   You can just say, give the value of the iPhone to charity,
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.680]   and they will take care of it.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.080]   Now, because you're listening to Mac break weekly,
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.360]   you're gonna get a 5% bonus if you Gazelle your iPhone
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.980]   before July 15th.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.840]   Here's how, here's the super secret way to do it.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.440]   When you're checking out, enter the word iPhone 5,
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.360]   IPH-O-N-E number 5, all one word,
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.520]   iPhone 5, check out, and if you're one of the first thousand
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.200]   audience members to Gazelle your iPhone, a free,
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.040]   zag iPhone screen protector will come your way along
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.600]   with your check.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.120]   Gazelle isn't just for iPhones, of course,
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.200]   you can Gazelle everything.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.440]   GPS's, Xbox's, PlayStations, Wii's, your ex-wife, MP3,
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.440]   but no wait a minute, that's wrong,
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.480]   I didn't see the ex-wife.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.600]   ebook readers, laptops, cameras, your ex-husband.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.640]   Gadgets in 20 product categories,
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.320]   over 200,000 unique items,
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.960]   and do check it out, if you have a charity,
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.680]   you're trying to raise money for better than a bake sale,
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.200]   have a Gazelle sale, they'll even get a dedicated page,
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.920]   just for your group, Gazelle.com,
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.720]   and by the way, when you have something that you send them
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.000]   that they cannot sell, if it's really old, beat up,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.800]   or useless, they will help you recycle your gadget responsibly,
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.200]   they use Cloud Blue as their primary recycling partner today,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.080]   one of the most respected domestic recyclers,
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.560]   BAN certified, they'll guarantee they'll be using
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.520]   a documented environmental management system,
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.800]   independently audited,
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.960]   they care a lot about no landfill, no export,
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.760]   no use of prison labor, no kids, of course,
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.560]   you know, they do it in the US,
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.280]   responsible, reliable recyclers,
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.840]   so it's great for recycling and selling.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.880]   But right now, Gazelle.com/iPhone
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.280]   and use iPhone 5 at checkout to get an extra 5% bonus
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.920]   on your iPhone, this is a way that you can afford
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.920]   that new iPhone.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.960]   Eliminate the complaints from your spouse.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.400]   - I just went through the process
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.240]   and it says it'll pay me $99 for my Kindle.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.280]   - Wow, that's pretty close to what you'd pay today.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.440]   They gotta be careful there because if, you know,
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.600]   the lines could cross, people could be buying Kindles
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.840]   and sell them to Gazelle.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.040]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.200]   - You should, they do, notice they have a graph.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.040]   - I don't know if you've noticed that,
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.600]   of the value as the value goes up or down.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.440]   - It's going down.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.360]   - Yeah, it's plummeting.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.560]   This is so cool, I really think it's a neat business.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.400]   I had lunch with their CTO a few weeks ago
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.200]   and it's just, it's out of Boston.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.600]   It's just a great little business.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.000]   Gazelle.com/iPhone, don't sell it, Gazelle it.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.760]   Let's see, are we, anything else?
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.200]   Oh, let me ask you this.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.560]   Okay, so Thursday, by the way, we're gonna do special coverage
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.440]   of the iPhone launch 'cause we like to do that.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.400]   Breaking news coverage, 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.840]   We will be starting our coverage as 1300 UTC.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.920]   For those of you on World Cup time.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:41.320]   And Alex, you're gonna be at the San Francisco store.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.680]   - Yep.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.640]   - The Emeryville store, which is a store
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.960]   in the San Francisco East Bay of San Francisco,
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.200]   that's where Tom Merritt will be.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.680]   And Sarah Lane, we're gonna send her to the mothership,
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.640]   the Palo Alto, they call it Steve Jobs Apple Store,
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.440]   the Palo Alto store, with live coverage.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.720]   And then I would like, if anybody's at an Apple store
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.840]   at that hour of the morning, I'd love to get you
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.880]   Skyping in, we'll give you a special tweet hashtag
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.000]   that you could Twitter us and tell us that you're, you know,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.560]   ready to be, and we'll Skype out to you
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.400]   and get you on the show.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.680]   So we did this when the iPhone 3G launched,
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.120]   and we started in New Zealand and went all the way around
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.080]   the world, 24 hours of iPhone.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.800]   I won't do 24 hours, we're just gonna do a few hours.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.640]   - It was fun though.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.280]   - It was, it wasn't, it was a lot of fun.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.120]   - It was a good time.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.320]   I think I got there like four, 30 or five o'clock
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.200]   in the morning, it was good.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.000]   - You saved my butt 'cause that was, I was really fading.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.840]   - Okay, I whacked it.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.200]   - You're like Jerry Lewis at hour 27.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.400]   - Yeah, if I'd had a--
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.240]   - If I'd had a--
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.080]   - I was on the phone.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:38.920]   - I would have.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.320]   - You're berating the cameramen,
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.920]   you're making the little kids cry.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.280]   - It was fun, it was really fun.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.440]   So here's my question.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.440]   I'm worse than you, Frederick,
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.600]   mine's not gonna come until July 15th at the earliest.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.400]   You're at least gonna get yours in a week.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.440]   - Yeah.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.200]   - Mine's not gonna come for two or three weeks.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.360]   Could I, do you think, I mean, they're gonna sell it
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.600]   on Thursdays and not only at AT&T and Apple,
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.720]   but also Walmart and Radio Shack and Best Buy.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.160]   Could I walk into a store, do you think, and get one?
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.800]   - You know, I was thinking the same thing.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.400]   If I could just show up at a store today,
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   get one and cancel my order online.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.520]   But knowing the fiasco that happened with the pre-ordering,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.640]   I'm afraid to even touch the lab work.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.520]   - I ain't canceling, I ain't canceling that pre-order.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.760]   - I'm gonna let it ride.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.600]   - Yeah, let it ride, baby.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.360]   - You put all your chips on red.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.320]   - Yep, they're all in red,
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.600]   I'm gonna wait till the thing shows up,
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.440]   then I'll be happy.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.040]   - I'm gonna be black 'cause you can't pre-order the white,
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.880]   can you?
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.720]   - That's right.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.440]   - Who wants a white iPhone and why do they even make those?
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.360]   So you can put the pink bumper on it
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.160]   and then it'll be really, really--
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.000]   - Oh, it's for-- - It'll be for--
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.840]   - It'll be for-- - It'll be for--
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.080]   - Yeah, it's for Paris Hilton.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.560]   I almost said it's for girls,
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.320]   but I know I would get a lot of email if I said that.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.320]   - That's why I said Paris Hilton--
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.760]   - Thank you, you're so smart, you're a wise man.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.120]   - As for the 3GS, everyone has to make the choice.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.240]   Darth Vader or Stormtrooper, it's up to you.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.280]   - Oh, I get it.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.120]   - Exactly.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.480]   - Oh, it's an Imperial thing.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.720]   Or Leia in episode four.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.560]   - So?
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.480]   - That would be brass.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.360]   They would need a brass iPhone for that.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.080]   - Now it doesn't seem so shabby now, does it?
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.480]   - No, that's kind of attractive.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.480]   (laughs)
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.560]   Although, since Jason Snow pointed out that the white one,
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.600]   especially with the new lines, those new sharp corners,
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.760]   it's such a positive throwback to the original iPod
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.000]   that was all flat,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.080]   (groans)
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   chrome and white and nothing else on hard edges
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.560]   and rounded corners.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.720]   - Well, if nothing-- - Which is kind of interesting.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.240]   - If nothing else, you'd be special, right?
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.640]   I mean, I have a white iPhone, the first one I got,
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.560]   or the second one, one of them is white.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.880]   And my son mocks me.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.720]   He said, "Dad, why do you have a white iPhone?"
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.400]   - And he was gonna do that anyway, so.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.240]   - Yeah.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.080]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.280]   He'll mock me no matter what I do.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.120]   So, I don't know.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.840]   You would be special if you had the white.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.880]   - Anyway, that's why people want it,
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.040]   just because everybody's going with the black one.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.880]   You gotta be non-conform.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.720]   - You gotta be different.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.720]   So, what is the consensus?
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.360]   Should I try to go to a womp?
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.520]   Okay, let's see, we're done.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.920]   We'll do our broadcast six AM to 11 AM
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.760]   and then Windows Weekly.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.360]   Should I just get up in the middle of Windows Weekly
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.160]   and run over to Radio Shack just to see?
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.680]   Is there any chance in the world
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.960]   that they'll have an iPhone?
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.160]   - I'm not going to run over to Radio Shack,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.720]   but I think that I'm probably gonna go walk over,
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.920]   I'm gonna be in the city and I'll probably walk over
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.320]   to the Apple Store later and just see if I can just walk in
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.720]   and see if there's anything left, but I doubt it.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.280]   I mean, I don't even know how many days sold,
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.440]   there must be a million.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.520]   I just don't know if they're gonna have any left.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.800]   - It's gotta be a million now.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.080]   - Save yourself the disappointment Leo, just wait.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.560]   (laughing)
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.840]   - Hi, it was like shopping for the Wii in the first two years.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.480]   Hi, do you have any iPhones now?
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.160]   - Yeah, like Tiny Tim, can I have some more?
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.760]   - Do you have any iPhones?
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.600]   - Oh, I feel like--
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.560]   - When the 3G came out, I thought,
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.400]   oh, I'm just not gonna go to the opening thing,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.520]   I'll get it the next day and then it was sold out
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.080]   and then it took me three weeks to get it,
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.720]   or go in different Apple stores.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.040]   And so it can get, you know, painfully back-ordered.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.200]   - So I should just be happy that I've got it July 15th
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.800]   and just leave it at that.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.560]   - I have the additional complication
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.120]   that I'm upgrading an existing phone,
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.880]   and so I don't even know what's gonna happen.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.640]   You can't take the sim out of the old phone
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.800]   and put it in the new one, it's a micro-cent.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.960]   - Exactly, 'cause it's a micro-cent.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.280]   That's gonna be a problem for some people.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.800]   But then again, if you're doing it the legitimate way,
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.040]   that wouldn't have been a problem anyway.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.800]   - But I think it's remarkable that we're talking about,
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.000]   it's a phone, and we already have,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.360]   you're already gonna get about 80% of the awesomeness
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.080]   of the iPhone 4 by getting just iOS 4.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.520]   - Thank you, that's an upsetly.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.560]   - Although, that's it.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.120]   - Although, see, although, I do have a little sympathy
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.360]   for you because there have been times when,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.480]   as we previously seen in this very show
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.240]   about my Kindle reader, I know I have a Firewire 800
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.920]   to Firewire 400 adapter somewhere in the house.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   Even if I were to pay myself $8 an hour to look for it,
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.280]   it would still be cheaper just to buy a new one.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.360]   So if you really don't know where your iPhone is,
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.960]   maybe it will be cheaper for you just to buy a new iPhone.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.800]   - Yeah.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.360]   I'm just breathing deep.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.560]   - Okay, go see Train Spotting.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.720]   That's a good primer on how to get through
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.640]   these withdrawals, so.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.000]   - Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:39:59.840]   I'm getting shamed.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.680]   - The question really is, what are you gonna do
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.120]   with your old iPhone?
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.560]   - I don't have it, my daughter lost it.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.400]   That's the real problem.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.200]   If I had my 3GS, I probably wouldn't be,
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.160]   well, I'd retired it for the Nexus One, which died.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.240]   This is the top, okay, go ahead fanboys, go, yeah,
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.400]   gleefully, gleeful gloating, go ahead.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.560]   It's more like the CEO who resigns before it knows
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.080]   that everything's gonna start to tank really, really fast.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.440]   - It was a little too quick.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.360]   Rather than be fired, he just wants the dignity of resigning.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.080]   - Well, if you see me carrying around a brick
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.600]   the size of a pack of playing cards, it's the Nokia N900,
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.560]   that's the phone I've been using.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.600]   - Your Nexus One left to pursue other opportunity.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.680]   - It did, it said no.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.000]   - Liam, I'm not gonna continue to work.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.040]   - The best of his luck is future endeavors.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.160]   - I'm not gonna continue to work.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.520]   If you're gonna make all this big deal about this.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.840]   - You're flirting a lot with that new phone over there.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.560]   That new phone's pretty cute.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.800]   I'm just gonna win the Nexus One left to take it.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.880]   - You know, though, okay, plug for HTC, I called them.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.040]   Not no hold time, maybe I called it the right time,
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.520]   although it was a Monday morning,
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.240]   which is notoriously bad for call centers.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.960]   No hold time, they said, oh, no problem.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.800]   You have two choices.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.280]   You could send it, we see yours is engraved.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.440]   You could send it back and get it repaired
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.520]   so that you wouldn't lose the engraving,
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.680]   or do you have another hand,
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.520]   they were very nice.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.840]   Do you have another handset you can use?
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.120]   I said, yeah, they said, well, you could send it back.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.800]   It'll take seven days, or if you want,
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.160]   we'll just send you a new phone and you'll lose the engraving,
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:27.960]   but you'll have a new phone
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.240]   and then you could send us the old one back.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.400]   And I said, oh, okay, so they're over-kniting me in Nexus One.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.720]   So I won't really be, you don't care about this, do you?
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.920]   - Apple has sold three million.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.960]   I could just hear the stony silence from the fan.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.160]   - Oh, no, no, see, I think the Nexus One is,
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.920]   I've had a lot more respect for the Nexus One
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.800]   ever since like switching to it for--
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.120]   - I love it. - Cold 30 for 10 days.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:49.960]   - I love it.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.600]   - I really think that once people start downloading
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.440]   Froyo 2.2 and start seeing how good Android can be
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.400]   without any of the third party add-ons
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.440]   with some very minor interface tweaks,
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.520]   it makes it more useful.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.960]   It really was a reinvention of this old phone
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.720]   that was just in a drawer for about a year for me.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.560]   - Yeah.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.800]   And I can use it to tether free with T-Mobile,
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.600]   so I can use it for Wi-Fi, I don't need a Wi-Fi.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.160]   - Oh, you're using it to wait.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.600]   - I'm getting messages in on Skype and Twitter
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.200]   that folks are having issues activating
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.280]   these pre-release phones, so--
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.120]   - Ah.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.400]   - Maybe it's good to hold off for a little while.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.240]   - Oh.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.680]   - Maybe you get the phone, but you don't get to turn it on.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.520]   - Oh, that'd be almost worse.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.920]   - That's the way worse.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.760]   - Two days?
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.040]   - Oh, two days?
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   - Oh, wait.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.600]   - Wait, telling you good things come?
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.120]   - I am gonna win a bet.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.480]   Actually, when I win two bets, I made a bet
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.200]   but when the iPad was announced with John C. DeVore Echo
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   for a bottle of Bordeaux and a stranger in the chatroom
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.200]   for $100, that Apple would sell five million iPads
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.280]   in the first year.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.200]   In the first 80 days, they've sold three million,
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.840]   unless something terrible happens,
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.400]   I think I'm gonna win this bet.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.120]   - Well, I still wanna reiterate,
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   my bet was 8.6 million.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.920]   - You still think 8.6?
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.760]   I guess you're on track.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.600]   - I think they're tracking.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.440]   - They're tracking.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.280]   - I think that's too many.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.120]   - It's awful.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:09.960]   - I think they need to be half that.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.560]   - They're tracking.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.400]   They're tracking.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.080]   There are 11,000 iPad-specific applications
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.840]   in the App Store, specific to iPad.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.680]   And Apple said that it is announced today,
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.600]   that it has sold its three millionth iPad,
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.880]   it did it on Monday, just 80 days after the introduction
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.840]   of its revolutionary and magical product.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.000]   - Has anything in the world ever sold that much?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.160]   - Oh, yes, come on.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.800]   That's not something, I suspect.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.280]   - I mean, a consumer electronics device
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.920]   in this price range, though.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.440]   - Three million in the first 80 days.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.280]   - Yeah.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.120]   - What?
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.080]   I can't think of anything that sold that many
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.160]   at that price point.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.400]   - Well, Windows sold that many in a week
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.480]   when it first comes out.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.400]   - If you're talking about one specific model
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.640]   of one specific thing, the car wire.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.480]   - $800.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   - No, probably nothing.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.120]   - You might be right.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.960]   - Yeah.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:09.360]   Next round of international launches coming up next month.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.360]   Austria, Belgium, Hong Kong, that's Group C.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.040]   Group D is Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.840]   No, no, I'm in a FIFA mode.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.320]   Netherlands, New Zealand, and Singapore.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.920]   No pricing announced yet for those countries.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.780]   Although I think the prices are pretty aggressive.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.720]   They're pretty close to these same prices in the US.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.960]   Wow, so that's a big hit.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.920]   You gotta wonder why even sell computers anymore
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.560]   when you've got an iPhone and iPad in your product.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.160]   But it doesn't really make you wonder
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.960]   like what kind of reinvention is in store for Mac OS
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.920]   and the Mac hardware.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.960]   - I have a crazy prediction.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.600]   - Okay, good.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.440]   - In the next five years,
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.080]   I think Apple's going to open source OS X.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:55.920]   - I like that.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.760]   You mentioned that before.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.720]   I think I love that idea.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.400]   It is open source kind of at a true star one.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.240]   - Well, the thing is,
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.560]   - All I'd have to do is open source Aqua,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.080]   you know, the top layer.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.720]   - Well, and the thing is, is I think Apple,
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.600]   when hardware sales reach 10 or 20% of their revenue,
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.520]   I think that they could license and say,
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.280]   this is what we're licensing as an approved Apple,
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.360]   whatever, and they'll still make money on that.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.640]   Open source, the operating system,
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.080]   and what you end up with is a mature,
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.440]   cultivated operating system
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   that people can then build on.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.120]   More importantly, even if they licensed it out,
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.360]   it means that we can have the computers that we want.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.720]   I mean, I love the Mac hardware,
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.240]   but it really frustrates me that Apple doesn't put USB 3 in.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.280]   They don't, they have these little computers
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.560]   without the express cards that we don't have enough cards
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.600]   in the larger hardware.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.840]   All those things would go away
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.360]   because Apple doesn't have to think about that anymore.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.480]   They're just gonna give us the operations.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.640]   Of course, there's the complexities
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.760]   of lots of different systems.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:49.600]   That's what Windows has.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.080]   - The good news is they are working on Xcode,
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.000]   because you need Xcode to develop for the iPad
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.560]   and the iPhone.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.720]   We're starting to leak out.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.080]   Now they showed it at WWDC,
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.680]   but you know the developers are supposed to sign an agreement.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.720]   They won't talk about any of this,
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.360]   but we're starting to hear about Xcode 4 now.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.120]   It's starting to leak out.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.800]   Then a major redesign,
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:11.640]   one big window in effect.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.200]   It sounds like, you know,
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.360]   the fact that they're revving it
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.200]   means that they're still paying close attention to it.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:24.560]   - Well, I think that they're paying close attention to that,
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.000]   but I think Xcode is the only thing
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.240]   that Steve cares about when it comes to the hardware.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.600]   And so I think, and eventually you could do that on an iPad.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.320]   You know, there's nothing about the,
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.160]   you could do all of that.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.120]   - Yeah, and I could develop on an iPad though.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.440]   - Eh, not yet.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.400]   I mean, we don't know where the iPad's gonna be in five years.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.240]   - Right.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.080]   - But the machines, but the--
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.120]   - But again, if you open source the system,
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.120]   you would still be able to have that platform.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.720]   And as I said, at first I was scared
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.720]   when I started thinking about that.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.880]   And then I realized for editors, for 3D folks,
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.920]   it would actually give us a lot more of what we want.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.080]   You could have the professionals have the crazy,
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.880]   tricked out systems that they want running OS 10.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.600]   And everybody else has an iPhone and iPad, and that's fine.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.120]   - They're integrating interface builder into the project builder,
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:05.960]   which is kind of cool.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.400]   Used to have to go out to a separate program
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.160]   to do the interface stuff, the widgets and all that stuff.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.880]   This is starting to look like a very slick development environment.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.040]   And they need it too.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.200]   Developers have to, you know, love it, right?
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.000]   - The only thing they get to use, so of course, is the--
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.840]   - Right.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.360]   - The ones that have to be totally,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.000]   they just, they can't develop for user number one.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.920]   They can't just be for Steve Jobs, because if the,
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.760]   oh, they're their entire success on development
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.960]   for every software, for everything that they make,
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.680]   is based on developers all being happy with Xcode.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.720]   What a juggling act.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.000]   I would not want to be the manager of that product at Apple.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.480]   - Subversion-- - Sharing the entire company.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.320]   - Subversion and Git support built in.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.960]   Those are the version control systems
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.720]   that are most commonly used by programmers.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.680]   There's a new fix it feature that fixes misspellings
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.520]   and errors.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.560]   It's kind of like a spell checker for programmers.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.880]   It even does the red squiggly underline.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.960]   Version control is using Git and subversion,
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.640]   but it's done like a time machine.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.400]   What they're really doing, and it's interesting,
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.600]   is making it easier and easier to use.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:15.240]   Hoping to encourage, I think, new programmers
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.080]   to come to this environment, get comfortable with it,
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.360]   'cause that's really what's gonna power all of these apps.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.520]   It's very important.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.680]   So you're right, I agree with you, Andy.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.520]   This is the last thing that Steve Jobs cares about
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.520]   at this point, or maybe that was Alex's point.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.600]   No, I meant it's the most important thing
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.600]   that Apple makes at this point.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.680]   - It is, isn't it?
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.080]   - Because, again, if they disconnect this product
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.920]   from the developers, or developers have complaints
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.760]   about Xcode that go unanswered,
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.240]   that's the feeder system for software, for the iPhone,
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.400]   for the iPad, and for desktop applications.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.840]   And Apple has already emphatically stated
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.040]   that they are a company that's based on the software.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.440]   They make margin on the hardware,
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.360]   but the reason the cherry on the top
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.800]   that gets people to buy the hardware
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.760]   is the experience of their operating systems
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.080]   and the third party software.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.080]   - Yeah, it's more important than Final Cut.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.760]   I mean, it really, it's the bread and butter at this point.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.520]   Apple has asked the FCC to keep the details of iPhone
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.100]   for under wraps.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.440]   The company, just a couple of days ago,
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.120]   even though the phone comes out on Thursday,
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.560]   and in fact, we're gonna have,
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.120]   iPhone repair says they're gonna come in here
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.200]   and take it apart on camera for us.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.280]   - They bring a blender?
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.240]   - I would not do that.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.160]   I think that's sacrilege.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.520]   I will not blend it.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.040]   I might blend this Nokia in 900, however.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:27.880]   (laughing)
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.720]   - Not that you're bitter.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.520]   - Not that I'm bitter or anything.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.320]   The company's requested the FCC keep photos
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:37.240]   and information of the handset secret for 45 days.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.920]   Pattonley Apple once again has the scoop.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.640]   The letter was addressed to the FCC signed by Robert Steinfeld,
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.000]   who is the wireless compliance manager with Apple.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.480]   Apparently there is a procedure at the FCC to do this.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.520]   It says, quote, "Although Apple has begun to market
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.720]   "the device publicly, these documents reveal technical
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.040]   "and design information that has not yet been publicly disclosed
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.120]   "in such marketing and that is protected by Apple
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.800]   "as confidential and proprietary secrets."
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.680]   So they want a short-term confidentiality agreement
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.840]   so that the test setup the FCC uses the internal
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.760]   and external views of the hardware,
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:16.200]   as well as the user's manual will be kept confidential.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.440]   It's interesting.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.640]   I wonder what's going on here.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.400]   Apparently they've done it before.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.320]   I don't know.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.280]   What could be so secret in there that we don't know about?
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.000]   I guess you can't really look into the A4 chip.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.360]   There's no way to look inside there.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.280]   That's why we didn't know how much RAM was in the iPad
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:41.720]   or the iPhone until Apple actually told developers that.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.720]   - And I think a lot of it is that if you're gonna let
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.440]   that information out, Apple just wants to get that head start
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.840]   as much of a head start as they can.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.200]   People are gonna, I mean, obviously some of it's patented
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.480]   but people are gonna do it anyway.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.640]   They're gonna do stuff that's like it
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.160]   and Apple wants to sell five or 10 million
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.320]   before everyone gets to that point.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.480]   - Clones it.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.120]   - According to appleinsider.com,
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.040]   things that Apple might be trying to keep secret
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:08.560]   is the Pentaband support, five band support
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:15.760]   in the cellular radio, 850, 900, 1700, 1900 and 2100 megahertz.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.880]   The 800 is for Japan and New Zealand.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.800]   Apple advertises quad band support
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.360]   but in fact it looks like the iPhone 4 is in fact a Pentaband
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.920]   possible support for CDMA, right?
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.640]   Or EVDO.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.280]   What if that's built in?
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.600]   - Oh, well that would be really interesting.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.840]   - That'd be a scooplet
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.880]   'cause that means sprinter Verizon.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.360]   - That would affect AT&T more than an affect Apple.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.880]   (chuckles)
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.440]   - Not that we would wish it will.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.440]   - You'd have a lot of people,
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.360]   you'd have a lot of people like me
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.240]   that are just, that we were re-signed
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.200]   in two year agreement that if we knew
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.400]   that Verizon's available, we would have gone.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.000]   - Yes, that's what you want 45 days on.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   - Yep.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.840]   - That's important, you're not gonna sell this phone
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.040]   if there were the slightest hint
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.080]   that Verizon would have it in two months.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:07.640]   But on the other hand, let's say they do announce
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.720]   a two months Verizon's got it.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:12.280]   How pissed off are you gonna be?
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.160]   Aren't you gonna feel like Apple's actually ripped you off?
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.520]   - I feel moderately, I mean, I have to admit
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.720]   that my pragmatic view of AT&T is that I think
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.320]   that any cellular network would have been brought
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:29.120]   to its knees by this many iPad and iPhone users.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.960]   And so I think Verizon will just be able to pain
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.960]   when they get it.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:35.440]   And so I'm not sure at this point,
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.760]   whether Verizon would be that much better than AT&T,
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.040]   I think AT&T has had to really build up their network.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.840]   And even though it's not very good,
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.360]   I think that part of that's just because
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.920]   it's getting hit so hard.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.400]   And so I think that they've built up a lot of muscle
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.520]   and even though it doesn't look like they've succeeded,
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.920]   I don't know if anybody else can handle that.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.480]   I mean, it's, as I said, it's just,
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.680]   I think an iPhone user is eight to 10 times more network
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.000]   intensive than everybody else.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.800]   And that's just gonna, you know,
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.000]   that's gonna hit the network,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.040]   whether it's Verizon or AT&T.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.160]   - Because there's so much custom,
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.800]   ASIC stuff in this phone,
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.000]   there could be stuff inside that we just, you know,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.760]   like CDMA receiver that we just wouldn't know about.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.920]   - Yeah, right.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.320]   - I don't know that I would switch right now,
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.400]   unless it was a really compelling price point
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.840]   to the Verizon plan,
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.640]   I don't know that I would switch even if it was available.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:27.240]   'Cause, you know, I know there's a lot of AT&T hatred
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.360]   out there, but, you know,
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.080]   at least in the circles that I move in,
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:35.000]   my phone works, you know, a good 50% of the time, 51,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:35.840]   so I'm okay.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.440]   - Wait a minute, I gotta see this.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.720]   This is from CNN Money.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.360]   The Apple Store, the guy first in line at the Apple Store
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.720]   right now in New York City has a sponsor.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:53.080]   - Oh no.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.560]   - Greg G-R-E-G Pack, or P-A-C-K-A-R.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.960]   - Oh, it's the same guy, isn't it?
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.560]   - I'm here in line, wait for iPhone 4G on Thursday.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.640]   - He makes a living doing this, apparently.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.400]   It's not the guy who's been first in line
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.400]   for every one of these things.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.240]   - And the going well.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.080]   - Yeah.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.840]   - And sometimes he's there, sometimes he's not there.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.920]   And if you think he's camping out there 24,
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.840]   he's not, he's just, look who his sponsor is.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.680]   - Yeah, there you go.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.520]   - It's Giselle.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.440]   It's the time that we come on.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:22.440]   - I was a website that's similar to eBay
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.440]   for electronics.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.400]   - Leo should you be getting a guy down there?
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.000]   We have a few undercount them by like 10 bucks.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   - That's freaking brilliant.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.840]   - We spoke toward their facility.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.240]   - And not only are they getting an ad
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.480]   with this clown in the front,
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.320]   they're getting this on CNN.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.160]   - They're probably on the front.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.480]   - I wanna meet their marketing people.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.560]   That's brilliant.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.400]   - It's brilliant.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.920]   I would have educated the guy a little bit more
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.320]   about what Giselle does.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.160]   - I know.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.080]   - If I was gonna, you know, I know I could give you
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.280]   some copy, dude.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.800]   - iPhone camper.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:53.640]   - Exactly.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.000]   (laughing)
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.400]   - That's pretty funny.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.480]   - Well, it definitely does send the message
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.440]   to the mass media and the public at large
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:05.440]   about how actual and genuine this enthusiasm is.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.040]   That goodness gracious, I guess all those people
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.440]   are waiting in line really do like this phone
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.800]   and really are excited.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:15.400]   - There is a Wikipedia article about Greg Packer.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.200]   He's an American highway maintenance worker
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.160]   from Huntington, New York.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.520]   Went to Huntington High.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.720]   He has been quoted in more than 100.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.040]   This guy makes a living doing this.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.440]   100 articles of television broadcasters
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.560]   as a member of the public, a man on the street.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.800]   He's been photographed at least 16 separate times
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.040]   by the Associated Press, 12 times by the post.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:39.200]   His strategy is to appear at likely news events
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.920]   and offer short statements to reporters.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.920]   He's like our version of the John 3 16 guy.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.400]   All he needs is a rainbow wig.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.720]   He doesn't have much to do.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.560]   - Leo, shall we shun him?
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.400]   - Let's shun.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.560]   - We shall shun him.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.120]   - We are shunning Greg Packer now.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.720]   He's a phony.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.560]   - He is shun.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.160]   Congratulations, Greg, you haven't been shunned.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.320]   - The tribe is throwing you out.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.800]   - That's hysterical.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.200]   - Take a logo off the torch
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.040]   and hold it over to us.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.760]   - His first quote was in the press
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.240]   in the Tampa Tribune in 1995,
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:14.040]   quote, "The Jewish people are fans of John Paul II."
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.480]   (laughing)
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.600]   - He just bites a line.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.880]   He's a professional man on the street.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.200]   - Wow, that's quite a business.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.760]   I didn't know that was possible.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.080]   - Who would have thought?
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:28.920]   Isn't that hysterical?
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:29.880]   - That's the nicest I've ever heard of one.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.160]   - But you caught it, Andy.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.000]   You said, "Oh, wait a minute.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.920]   "That's that guy we saw last time."
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:34.760]   - Yeah.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.280]   - That is very funny.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.120]   All right, well, I'm gonna--
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.400]   - I'm gonna, just goes to show you kids.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.320]   You know, whatever career you think you're gonna have,
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.360]   your ideal job probably doesn't even exist yet.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.320]   Did he think that he's gonna be a professional loafer?
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.160]   No, he didn't.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.320]   And yet he chased that dream
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.200]   and now that dream is like a right pair
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.400]   right in his hand, right for the eating.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.640]   - Just follow your bliss, friends.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.400]   Do what you love and the gazelle advertising will follow.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.920]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more,
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.720]   lots more Mac news, but before we do that,
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.560]   go to meeting.com has a word for you.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.480]   The folks at Citrix make online meetings easy
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.000]   and I use it and I love it
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.640]   and there's a great iPad app for this.
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.360]   If you haven't used it, it's free,
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.120]   but before you can use the iPad app,
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.920]   you have to set up GoToMeeting on your Mac
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:17.960]   or Windows machine.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.800]   So here's what you do.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.200]   You do this for free too.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:24.880]   Go to meeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.880]   Go to meeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.800]   It'll take you a minute to it, not even that long.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.600]   If you're, you know, 30 seconds to install this thing.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.080]   Now, the next time you're on the phone
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.960]   you say, oh gosh, I wish I could show you my keynote
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.040]   or I have the spreadsheets right here,
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.520]   or we could work together on this document.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.840]   If only there were a way, a little light will go off.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:44.800]   You go, wait a minute, there is a way.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.880]   I got GoToMeeting, it's installed.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.000]   And you tell your client or your colleague
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.040]   or the person you're pitching,
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.760]   you say go to go to meeting.com.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:55.400]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.520]   You can send them a link, make it easy.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.720]   In an email, you can do it ahead of time.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.040]   You can invite them to a meeting.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.000]   It'll show up on their Outlook calendar, whatever.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.840]   Or you could say here, go to GoToMeeting.com.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:04.680]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.920]   Now they're seeing your computer.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.520]   You can, they can show you their computer.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.760]   It takes some seconds to install
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.520]   and all of a sudden you're collaborating,
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.080]   you're training, you're presenting.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.880]   It has to be easy, by the way, or client.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.960]   You know, you're not gonna make somebody
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.240]   your pitching jump through hoops
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.520]   and they make it very easy.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.440]   It includes for one low flat rate,
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   as many meetings as you want,
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:29.360]   as long as you want plus phone and voice over IP conferencing,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:33.200]   free, and it's 30 days free for you, a $49 value.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.800]   If you go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak, try it.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.720]   I know you'll find lots of uses for it.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.800]   We have several accounts.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.800]   Ooh, somebody's just completed their iPhone upgrade.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.520]   No, no, no, I just, I got,
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.120]   my mutual friend Clayton Morris got a note
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.760]   that he talked to Gazelle today
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.560]   and they're gonna be their live on Thursday
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.480]   at the Apple Store.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.600]   Talk to taking iPhone 3G and 3G
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.920]   and things for cash right there, but in there.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.600]   Just have a box out front.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   Here, we'll give you cash.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.760]   (laughing)
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.920]   These guys, this, they told me when I had lunch with them,
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.400]   and he said, yeah, this is our busiest time.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.840]   Every year is this iPhone thing.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.280]   This is because Apple has conveniently staged
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.360]   a yearly update for a product
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.920]   that you continue to pay for for two years.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:23.800]   So people need to do this kind of somehow upgrade thing.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.560]   Frankly, Apple should have done it.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.840]   They could have saved themselves a lot of time.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.800]   I don't know because iPhone 3s and 3GS
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.360]   are always useful and valuable.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.760]   I would you want to treat it in.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.960]   Hey, you know what?
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   Let's commend Apple though,
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.880]   that they did not charge for the OS4 upgrade.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.720]   They pushed it out ahead of the phone.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.640]   I mean, that's a nice refresh.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.720]   That's a good gift to people who, you know,
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.160]   saying, look, we'll keep your 3GS, or even your 3G.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.120]   We'll keep it relatively up to date.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.160]   We'll give you this upgrade.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.040]   That's a pretty good deal.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.720]   They could have charged money for it.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.640]   They could have blamed accounting practices
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.080]   and charge them 10 bucks.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.480]   Is it free on the touch?
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.320]   Do you get it on?
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.240]   It is. It is free.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.560]   And I presume it'll be free on the iPad.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.320]   Hopefully.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.760]   I wonder why it takes longer on the iPad.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.760]   I think it's partly because they have to rethink
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.280]   of how these interfaces are going to work in the iPad.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.280]   I don't think it necessarily follows that the same mechanisms
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.800]   for application switching would work as well
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.920]   on a huge, incredibly wide screen as it would on the iPhone.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   So OS4 iPad may be different.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.120]   I think I'm really not sure.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.920]   I mean, there are a lot of reasons why it could be different.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.720]   I think the primary one is just that iPhone,
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.760]   iOS 4 heading out in time for to be shipped on every single iPhone
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.560]   for what's so important that let's not even waste any time
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.680]   where we're already burning through 40 million iPads per month.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.840]   They don't need this incentive of wait for iOS 4.0 for the iPad to come out.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.960]   So I think it's mostly, I would guess it's mostly
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.720]   a problem of manpower rather than technical things.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.680]   But I do, I wouldn't be surprised if things worked a little bit differently
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.120]   on the iPad than on the iPhone.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.960]   Hey, Clayton Morris.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.360]   I don't want to see Greg Packer on Fox and Friends.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.640]   Right.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.200]   He is shunned.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.600]   The community is shutting him.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.640]   You must join the shutters.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.480]   As a matter of fact, they'll be a good visual,
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.560]   like the line of people behind him to ceremoniously one by one
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.200]   in sequence turn their backs.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.440]   Oh, yes.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.160]   He reals as he realizes that, oh, oh, no, no, the CNN truck is pulling in.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.560]   I better go for my hotel room, two blocks away and run back to my place in line.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.320]   Sir, monously, the last person line turns around
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.360]   in the next person, the next person.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.000]   And then that'll be the story.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.600]   So, gee, why is everybody turning their backs?
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.160]   Oh, we've shunned him because we believe that he is just one of these publicity
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.120]   how are you?
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.600]   Or as they as they say, New York, a ho.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.080]   And therefore he has been shunned, not banned, but shunned.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.400]   He's welcome here.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.120]   His money is good.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.200]   If he wants to wait in line, he can do that.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.360]   We are simply shunting him.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.840]   According to CNET, one analyst is predicting that by 2012,
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.080]   16 and a half million iPads will be sold.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.400]   So that's the first two years.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.120]   37,000 iPads a day have been sold.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.000]   I would not have guessed that.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.960]   I was asked to predict it the first week.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.240]   And I said, more than three, I would say about five.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.720]   And I thought I was being a little because I didn't because everyone was so
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.640]   excited about the iPad.
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.080]   I thought, well, how many computers could they sell of these?
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.680]   This thing that never existed before, where everybody has to be sort of taught
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.880]   what this computer is and what it does.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.920]   I would never have guessed that many so.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.600]   Yeah, I felt what I felt like I was out on a limb when I said five.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.520]   I didn't feel absolute confidence.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.920]   I thought, well, that's the most possible.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.800]   But what I think neither of us, only anybody realized is how I've watched now,
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.560]   you know, my father-in-law, my mother, both in their 70s,
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.360]   my CEO, Lisa, who is a dying in the wool windows user.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.240]   I've watched so many people just fall literally in a way that you don't
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.640]   normally fall in love with technology.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.320]   It's so intimate.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.560]   It's like an iPhone in that sense.
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.960]   It's personal and they literally have this emotional relationship with it.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:08.560]   And that's, I think, a very good sign for a product when people get that
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.480]   emotional about it, you know, I'm shocked that it's is now officially been
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.880]   months since this has been released.
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.280]   And still, if I'm using this in public,
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.760]   if all I know, I'm saying, if I'm using this in public, there is a one in three
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.280]   chance that I will be given, I will be giving a five to ten minute demo of it
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.760]   from someone who is just incredibly excited to simply be seeing an iPad.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.000]   That's actually being, you know, that I've heard about this.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   I've always wanted to see one.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:32.640]   What is it like?
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:36.080]   You know, it's like bringing many celebrity in and I'm surprised that there's still
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.520]   that level of excitement just three months later.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.880]   It happened to me last night, checked in at the hotel and the desk clerk said, Oh,
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.000]   I haven't seen one.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.800]   I was, yeah, it was like, what?
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.160]   Really?
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.480]   Just let me see it.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.120]   And she's touching it.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.280]   Now, what's interesting, so many people are familiar with the iPhone.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.120]   She was instantly comfortable with the metaphor and she's touching it.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.520]   She's and I thought that was very telling.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.440]   You know, one of the things that I thought was interesting is my son, who has
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:02.760]   been playing with the iPhone and the iPad, he walked up to my laptop and he
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.320]   touched them, he touched my screen and then he just looked very disappointed.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.040]   He was like, I don't understand everything to be touching.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.360]   That's exactly right.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.400]   And that's why your prediction is probably true, Alex.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.160]   It's something's going to happen with Mac because we have that standard now.
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.960]   I think I've written this play on my next iMac.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.640]   Well, that's for sure true.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   I need a million pixels and a touchscreen.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.920]   That's for sure true.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.200]   We need 300 DPI plus, but also I found myself touching it.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.760]   I did two days ago, Ken Shepherds, and showing me something on his netbook.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   And I touched, I really just had to touch it.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.960]   So even I am doing that.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.200]   So I think that that's a sign.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.640]   Last week, Alex, I wasn't here.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.480]   Did you talk about the new Mac mini at all?
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.320]   We did.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.160]   OK, so that's I don't have to worry about that.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.160]   Here's a story.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:55.440]   So I get I get yesterday, I'm starting to I'm buying an application of my
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.600]   my wife's iPhone, not my iPhone, my wife's iPhone.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.600]   And I see, oh, you have to agree to the new Apple terms of service.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.360]   Forty five page terms of service.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:09.280]   Like I'm going to sit here and read forty five pages.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.800]   They said, well, we can't email it to you.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.200]   No, I agree, whatever it is.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:16.200]   So it turns out inside that forty five page terms of service, here's a little
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.760]   paragraph, Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies and mobile
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.040]   advertising services.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:24.920]   Oh, actually, that's not the one I want to read.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.320]   This is the opt out, which I love.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.080]   But I'll read this one.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.360]   This is this is actually good.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.440]   To control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.720]   interests and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.720]   If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.600]   device, you can opt out.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.360]   I'm thinking somebody reads these things.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.320]   This is from Apple insider.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:52.560]   Oh, I'm sorry, MacRumors.com, Erica Silvka by accessing the following link on
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.400]   your device.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.720]   You're ready?
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.280]   Everybody.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.880]   Oh, oh, dot Apple dot com.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.880]   That's all you have to do.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.520]   Opt out.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.760]   Oh, oh, dot Apple dot com.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.760]   It's like Facebook.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.000]   We got so hard to remember.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.640]   If you opt out, you'll still get the same number of mobile ads, but they may be
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:13.280]   less relevant because they'll not be based on your interest.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.720]   In other words, we will stop collecting what you're up to.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:20.240]   You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.200]   or based on other nonpersonal information.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.360]   And this, of course, only affects Apple advertising services.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.320]   So that's cool.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.520]   Oh, oh, dot Apple dot com.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.200]   Surf to it on your iPhone or I presume your iPad.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.160]   Well, that was one thing we learned by reading the 45 pages.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:39.160]   But here's one that this is the one that scared me in Los Angeles times discovered
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.800]   this one in the revised iTunes store terms.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:50.160]   Apple may collect, quote, precise real time geographic location data for users
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.080]   of its products and the data may be used by Apple and unspecified partners and
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.280]   licensees in order to improve services and advertising.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.960]   The company says the data is anonymous and does not personally identify users.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:06.080]   However, as we all know, if you get enough data points in a set, you can
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:12.560]   identify people easily to provide location based services on Apple products.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.720]   Apple and our partners and licensees may collect, use and share precise location
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:21.800]   data, including the real time geographic location of your Apple computer or device.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.360]   The data is collected anonymously in a form that is not personal.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.880]   Identify you and is used by Apple and our partners and licensees to provide
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.000]   improved location based products and services.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.680]   Is that bother anybody?
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.800]   Not particularly, unfortunately, with those agreements,
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.200]   you know, they're always worded in such a way that you don't know if this is just simply.
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.160]   We just want if you ask, if you ask Google Maps to give you a real location or
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.000]   big maps your location, we want to have the legal right to say big maps.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.480]   Here is where our user is right now.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.360]   Please return us a map and routing.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.720]   You don't know whether it is simply as simple and innocuous as that or
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:01.400]   whether it is as complicated as we have a brand new ad structure that is going to
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:06.920]   add location awareness and not only that, but location behavior to the to the profile
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.840]   of this user and we're going to sell the information.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.240]   Apple has given their own version of the we're not an evil company.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.320]   We don't do evil things to our users policy, but we are all.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.600]   That's a very nice statement to make it.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.640]   It's only enforced until the first time we hear about something like this being abused.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:26.720]   So I mean, I really think that we're going to start to need to have sort of terms of service reform.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.680]   Just like right now, it's you.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:32.840]   The credit card company cannot give you like an 80 page terms of service without having
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.680]   a simple one or two page says, here's what the interest rate is.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.320]   Here are the circumstances under which the interest rate will change.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.480]   And here are the terms under which we can pull your card.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:45.120]   I really think we're nearing that point where the first time that someone wants to get
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.040]   out of this terms of service and they want to make the statement that no sane person is going
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:55.040]   to sit here and want and scroll through 40 pages of legales presented in a three by five card
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.760]   window that has to be clicked through manually.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.480]   And then a judge will say, yep, you're right.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.120]   They clearly did not intend for the user to actually read all of this.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.760]   And so this terms of service is null and void.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:10.160]   Yeah, I mean, 45 pages admittedly, it's 45 iPhone sized pages, but it's still a lot to read.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:10.880]   You're not exactly.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.400]   You're not going to sit there, especially on an iPhone and just click, click, click, click, click.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.680]   We do need a form of reform, even if it's a voluntary thing where it just
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.880]   have some sort of an IEEE ISO certification that says, here's the point size.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.080]   Here's the here's the only get two thousand.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.920]   You have to hear here's the I was going to say, do it in the form of a tweet, but that's not going
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:37.520]   to work. But at least if it's something that I cannot get in one K or two K worth of space,
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.360]   then you just should not you should rethink how you present this terms of service.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.720]   It's just no use to anybody.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:47.200]   Here's some some other good news.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:53.160]   Apple says we thought this, but Apple confirms that FaceTime will not use your
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.520]   3G minutes or your phone minutes. It's just why that's why it's Wi-Fi, right?
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.880]   Always always pitch it as a user feature.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.200]   We we don't want to inconvenience people by disabling their 3G medicine.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.640]   So you're welcome.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.400]   We've made it Wi-Fi only. What else can we do for you today?
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.200]   We did it for you.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.440]   No, tethering is too complicated.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.840]   Well, then we won't have it.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.200]   There you go. OK, how many of you when your iPhone four comes are going to make
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.280]   it a FaceTime call like in the first day?
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.760]   I'm going to I'm going to do the Mrs. Wiggens sketch from
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.240]   a conference.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.640]   So hello, Mrs. Wiggens. Will you come in here?
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.640]   Beep. I'm how you doing? I'm going to do it.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.840]   Just you're going to call yourself.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.960]   I'm going to push. Don't push the call.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.040]   We're going to call each other.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.840]   Frederick's going to call you. I'll call. Yeah.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.600]   I'd be like, hi.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.640]   And by the way, that that will be the last time we will use FaceTime.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.680]   For the next.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.320]   No, no, no, no.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.480]   My my my wife as soon as she saw it, she was like, oh, I might have to get my
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.800]   parents on iPhone. Really?
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.560]   You know, I mean, like it was like, yeah, it was like because they don't really
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.280]   want to use.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.400]   You know why you Skype?
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.480]   Skype or I chat on the phone.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.880]   I mean, on their computer, they they are phone people.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.760]   And the idea of having a video.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.880]   Person is a is you know, having video.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.120]   And you can see how well Wi-Fi works, by the way.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:18.640]   The first time someone someone that someone FaceTime's like,
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.440]   here is my here's our new baby.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.960]   And she just learned how to say grandpa, say hello to grandpa,
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.600]   little trial faz.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.880]   Then as soon as as soon as that that retirees tells all their friends,
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.960]   guess who's getting really different iPhone fours for Christmas.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:35.120]   I really I really don't think it's like face to face conferencing.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.600]   I really think it's more like live video streaming, like cameraman.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.480]   You are here and I'm showing you exactly what I'm seeing right now.
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:41.920]   Right.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.400]   As I walk around, because it's I mean, you're absolutely right.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.840]   No one wants to see, you know, here here.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.400]   I am holding my iPhone and you can see how badly a job I'm doing on my nose here.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:50.800]   Trimming.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.560]   And we'll see iPhone fours being banned from concerts and that sort of thing.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.080]   That's right.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:55.720]   Nobody.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   Now it's funny how many people have come up to me?
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:02.480]   See, I've seen the Apple ads and the thing that they almost universally say is,
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.520]   isn't it cool?
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.480]   Deaf people will be able to sign to each other.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.440]   Mm hmm.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.680]   I mean, maybe that's a big mark.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.040]   They can sign to each other as it is.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.000]   They're very, very good at it.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:11.480]   I've seen it.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.600]   But now they can do it over the phone.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:14.920]   Oh, by the phone, I'm sorry.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.240]   Yes.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.440]   Maybe that's the market.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.760]   It's not a huge market.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.240]   I mean, that's good.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.600]   I don't know.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.720]   I should have a couple of different friends.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.320]   I should ask them.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:26.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:31.320]   I mean, part of it is, well, you also have a device that like can text very, very readily.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:31.640]   Right.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.640]   Why not just text?
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.880]   Also, also the two that I know very, very well have devices that are attached to a couple of their hearing aids.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.240]   So that it's essentially like an input.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.760]   It's like a headset device that interfaces with the iPhone as it is.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:53.280]   But that during the keynote presentation during WWDC, at the end of that video, it wasn't the, oh, look, we're, here's a little baby.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:53.440]   Trauma.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.280]   It wasn't the baby.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:54.720]   Steps.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:00.320]   It was like the applause came when you saw two people using ASL to communicate via a face chat.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:00.600]   Yep.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.320]   That was the big one.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.720]   But don't you need two hands to do most of these signs and are you going to be able to hold it while you're doing that?
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.680]   It stands on its edge, though, right?
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.720]   You just put it on the desk.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:12.920]   Not well.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.360]   That's it.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.000]   I mean, how well is it?
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.200]   Isn't that video?
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.000]   They had somebody who was trying on clothes or whatever.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.120]   So you just set it on the counter.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.280]   Maybe that's why it's square edged.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.240]   Mm-hmm.
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.880]   Did you download iBooks 1.1?
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.320]   I did PDF capability.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:32.040]   I was able to export from my email a PDF to it and it shows up.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:32.680]   It's kind of nice.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:37.440]   I mean, it's my PDFs now have parity with my books at the iBook from the iBook store.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.520]   It's now the simplest way to simply, if you have a piece of, if you have an document that you need to keep with you, like flight
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.880]   instructions or flight reservations, email it to yourself, give it a tap.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:49.920]   Not only do you read it, but it also gets imported into the library and it sticks.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:58.160]   Given that every single Macintosh can print to a PDF readily, I think this is going to be one of the most exploited features for Mac users on the iPhone.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.200]   It just simply hears everything into one step.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:00.640]   Awesome.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.080]   It's really good.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.040]   Let me call Alex back.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.400]   Looks like he's dropped off the face of the earth.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.520]   Alex is in the, as we mentioned, in the convention center in San Jose and on.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.000]   Why?
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.120]   And a name source close to the power plant.
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.160]   To our device has been implanted.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.000]   Hey, putting manuals on this.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.440]   Somebody suggested putting the 5D Mark II manual on there.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.480]   That'd be cool, wouldn't it, Fred?
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.720]   That would be excellent.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.320]   Yeah, actually.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:23.960]   And I agree with Andy.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:34.280]   I think it's, it's, it's, it's wonderful for PDFs, the iBooks app, but I am, I am less than enthusiastic about other books on there in that sort of.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.840]   Well, they don't have any books in the call during library.
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.000]   That's part of the problem, right?
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:45.160]   And the ones that they do have on there, I just, you know, I'm a fan of, of formatting that looks really good, not just a stream of texts.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:45.680]   So.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:54.960]   So you have now in the iBooks, you have a, once you add a PDF, you'll have a books button that shows the books you've purchased in the store and then you'll have a PDFs button.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.560]   And the PDFs are treated exactly as a book would be with all the same controls.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.160]   I love that.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:04.840]   You don't have the text enlarging capability.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:09.400]   You know, you have search and you have the, let me show it here.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.560]   They have search and you have the brightness.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.600]   You have bookmarking, but you don't have.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.040]   And I wish you did the ability to change the font.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:23.760]   I guess that's only because, you know, it has to be in the format that you could change the font, but you do have a very easy way to jump to pages at the bottom here.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.160]   You have a thumbnails.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.120]   That's the iPad version.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:30.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.840]   You're talking about iBooks in general, not just on the iPhone.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.160]   Right.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.120]   Well, this is the iPad version.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.480]   And what does it look different on the iPhone?
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.040]   No, I mean, it's pretty much exactly the same.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.880]   As you can see, I spend a lot of time stocking my iBooks shelf with content.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:49.960]   But it's it's I have to be exactly the same all the way from getting into the store.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:57.200]   The first thing you do when you launch it is it asks you want us to sync up all your data with the store from from other.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.400]   That's a new feature, too.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:58.720]   Right.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.840]   Is it the synchronization feature is kind of neat.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.120]   Right.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.640]   So not only not only will it not only will it remember your place,
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:10.880]   but also if you leave notes, bookmarks, all that sort of stuff, those also will be synced from book to book to book.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.320]   But not only the books, right?
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.720]   Not PDFs.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.000]   PDFs you have to manually arrange the the iPhone version will also just like the iPad version,
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   allow you to drag your own unlocked ePubs in.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.400]   That's that's that's another feature that we haven't talked about yet.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:32.520]   That doesn't get talked about enough that iPhone OS four has the same mechanism for application documents, thinking as the iPad does.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.000]   So now.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:40.080]   So now even when you have it synced up when you have iTunes for your iPhone, applications can if they support this feature.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.360]   You can drag your own documents into its space and can import them directly.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.400]   That's neat.
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.080]   It is.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.960]   So you don't go to that's why I say this is this is this is a lot.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.160]   This is I iOS four is turning the iPhone into very much an iPad nano.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:17:03.320]   And if you have like me, if you're an iPad user who kind of said, oh, I don't even iPhone anymore because I got the iPad now, there is more of a compelling reason to get an iPhone and an iPad.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.400]   They work together better.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:12.800]   My my dream has always been like the one pocket sort of long weekend vacation where I might have to I might have to write a few things.
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.880]   I might have to post something to a blog where I don't even necessarily need an iPad with me all the time.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:23.960]   But all I really need is a foldable keyboard by Bluetooth and the ability to write 500 to 1000 words worth of text.
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:28.640]   I would certainly not leave the iPad at home because it's just too big and heavy for me.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:37.360]   But the ability to simply board a plane carrying nothing but the iPhone and like a pocket size, one of those one that's really cool, like Palm style folding keyboards, the work by Bluetooth.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.560]   That really does change the iPhone.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.960]   And again, it does change the iPhone into something you could do on a Sony Erickson phone as a five years ago.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:49.160]   But you would used to be stuck with Sony apps and Sony interface and, God, dang it.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.640]   Life is too short for that sort of stuff.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.840]   Any other.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:01.680]   Oh, and the end that I say I posted a video yesterday, the iPad keyboard dock works just fine with an iPhone iPhone 3GS.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.280]   Oh, really?
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.320]   I saw that.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.080]   That's cool.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.160]   Bluetooth support is already there for keyboards.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:08.960]   But you know what?
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.120]   I had I had it on the shelf.
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:10.680]   I took it down.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.040]   Say, Gee, I wonder what happens if I plug the iPhone into this and well, I'll be darned.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.240]   It works perfectly fine.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:21.200]   Just as well as it does on the iPad, which led to like the next question, which was, I don't.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:25.280]   If the keyboard works, I wonder if the camera connection can work.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.840]   If the camera connection can works, can I plug in a regular USB keyboard and a microphone?
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:36.760]   And that was the time it said, how dare you say this is not designed to work with the iPhone.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.680]   Who gave you that idea?
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.440]   You filthy.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.400]   Oh, so they they turned you down.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.360]   It turned you down.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.640]   No, the keyboard dock works just fine.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:49.440]   The USB adapter from the camera connection kit does not work in any way, shape or form.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.400]   I know has anybody, by the way, has anybody jailbroken iOS for yet?
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.480]   Because that's that would be one of the first things you do.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.920]   Nobody is ever happy.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.000]   You've got it for two hours.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.960]   The car already still wants to jail break.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.040]   But I want to jail break it.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.120]   All right.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.400]   It was the people like don't know.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.600]   Those will not eat the casserole because they just know they're not going to like it.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.800]   Why not just taste it first?
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.640]   Maybe applesaupt every problem you had.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.280]   All right.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.280]   Never mind.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.600]   Well, I know that that's what I mean.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.280]   That's what I'm playing to do with my old phone is I'm going to I'm
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.040]   finally going to I'm going to jailbreak it.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.320]   Are you?
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.560]   Yeah, I'm going to I'm just I'm I'm missing the opportunity of playing with all those.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.560]   Well, that's a good reason.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.320]   Yeah, I wouldn't do it on my main phone, but I think that's a good reason to keep that old phone.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.600]   What do you want to install on their Alex?
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.440]   What are you missing?
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.720]   You know, I just want to see what's there.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.360]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.240]   I have a friend of mine, Hennie, Abdul Rizour in Tanzania.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:46.920]   He has this one.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.280]   I don't know why I think it's so cool.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:52.120]   He just shakes and it just answers like if it's ringing, he just picks it up and he just goes
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.400]   and it just answers the phone.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.360]   And I don't know why I think that that's great, but I'm like, I just want to have the opportunity.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:04.720]   But for the iPad, for me, it's being able to capture the screen, you know, because we want to do stuff where we show the iPad screen.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.000]   And so being able to, you know, jailbreak the iPhone, I think both of them.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.360]   You can do it with the iPad or the iPhone.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.640]   Once you jailbreak it, stupid that Apple won't let us have that because they have it.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:22.240]   Yeah, that's something we're dealing with on launching our iPad today show.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:26.320]   I think we're just going to shoot the screen with a finger, big fat finger running around on it because we can't.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:31.160]   I mean, we have a way, Don McAlister's figure out a way to get all of it out of a VGA, but then you don't see your finger.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.200]   And right.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:40.240]   Hey, an alert if you are a steam user, which I am, and I'm going to talk about steam in a little bit, but Apple's update to steam.
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:45.480]   The 10 point or actually Apple's update to OS 10, the 10.64 update has, according to steam,
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:49.680]   noticeable performance issues for NVIDIA graphic chips owners running high performance games.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:55.280]   So don't update if you're a steam user and you're playing a big 3D games on steam.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:03.080]   If you have already installed the update and believe your graphic performance is affected, says steam, please contact Apple.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:06.960]   We have no fix for you.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.000]   Maybe maybe if you bitch to Apple, they'll fix it.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.120]   They what they sounds like they did is they put it in a drive, a substandard driver, subpar driver.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.120]   And they need to get a better, better driver in there.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:26.080]   More information on the updated ht4150@support.apple.com.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:32.360]   So let us get our picks of the week in just a second. Are you ready, fellas?
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:35.240]   Yes. Yes. Yes.

[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.720]   dot thing, by the dig thing, you don't have to worry.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:52.400]   They just their virtual server technology means they just got bandwidth to spare.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.800]   You know, my my thing is I just want to focus on the content.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.160]   I don't want to figure out how to code it.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.080]   I don't know.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.040]   I don't know.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:23:59.520]   I don't.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.000]   Starts at $8 a month for the basic version.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:17.160]   If you want to do the big community package for large projects, not just $50 a month, you get a custom URL, five gigabyte storage, 400 gigabytes a month bandwidth, six custom audiences, unlimited members, unlimited editors.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.040]   The custom audiences thing is kind of intriguing.
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:29.880]   You should if you want to know more about that, you should go to the site is you can have groups of members within your site, each with different access levels, different modules, different permissions.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.520]   So there's a public audience, but then they're additional.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:38.480]   You can have up to up to six additional audiences, which is really an interesting slice.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.680]   Really powerful.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:44.800]   That's what we'll do for the radio show, by the way, squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.640]   We thank them for their support of Mac break weekly.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.520]   Frederick van Johnson.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.400]   Yes.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.800]   Media bites.com.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.720]   What is your pick of the week?
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.800]   Well, you know, I've got I've got two small ones.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.840]   So the first one is Sonos.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:05.080]   So you're familiar with Sonos, they make those controllers where you can stream your music throughout the house.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.960]   I have zone players in three rooms, bedroom, living room and kitchen.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.760]   I use the iPhone app.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.720]   It is awesome.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:16.240]   Well, Leo, you will be happy to know that they're coming out with a free.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.520]   If it's not available today, I think it may be available today iPad app.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.520]   I thought they said August.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.080]   Is it soon?
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:21.600]   Is it really?
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:22.680]   I think it's today.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:28.160]   I've been using the iPhone app on it, which is OK, but it could be better.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:28.880]   Yep.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.360]   So that's my that's my pick.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.800]   I'm going to I think I'm going to switch over the Sonos.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:38.200]   I've been using just airport expresses around the house and streaming music to those,
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.200]   but there's no feedback from the different zones.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.400]   So I want to I think I want to upgrade the experience and go with the Sonos.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.760]   I am that's expensive.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.760]   I think it's three ninety nine a unit, but the sound quality superb.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.680]   You get, you know, you have the ability to
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.000]   have them all bound together or each one separately.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:25:59.480]   Mm hmm.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.880]   You could play radio.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.360]   You know, all the internet radio features you'd want.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.520]   Yes, not in the store yet.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.160]   Boy, I'm excited because I've been waiting for them to do this upgrade.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.960]   This is one of the one of the programs I've been, but you know, you can use it on the iPad.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.280]   It's just it's that big iPhone interface.
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.320]   Yeah, there's an article about it on in gadget right now.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.280]   So yeah, check it out over there.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.280]   Awesome.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.000]   Good.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.960]   And my second one is you guys, you know, you probably know about this app already,
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:28.480]   but I just discovered it on my iPad called reader, R E E D E R.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.960]   It's on the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.640]   There's iPad Google reader version and kind of pulls in your, your Google feed, but it.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:42.000]   I got to say the iPad version has got to be one of the best designed iPad applications
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.120]   I've experienced so far is it the fit and finish and the attention to detail is
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.200]   insane.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:47.800]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.440]   I love that.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.320]   I love the folders.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.640]   It really is slick and it's fast, which a lot of these readers are not.
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.000]   The only thing I don't like about reader is it's delicious support is not doesn't
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:26:59.800]   isn't full support.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.720]   It doesn't do OAuth.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.520]   So I can't yet any day now.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.880]   I'll be everything's any day now.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:11.600]   Any day now I'll be able to to delicious tag these, but it's really yet they did a nice job.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.360]   Jimmy Kimmel's MacBook saves the day after power outage.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.960]   Jimmy decided to film tonight's entire episode using his MacBooks webcam.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.600]   What?
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.680]   The, that might have been a stunt.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.680]   He does those sometimes.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.560]   Uh, yeah.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.320]   I mean, come on.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.040]   They say that the power went on in the set.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:35.160]   That's hard to believe that they didn't have any other way to shoot it.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.320]   They didn't show the whole show on the Mac book.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:37.680]   Did they?
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.400]   See, if he had an iPhone four, you could have filmed the whole episode.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.040]   And he would not be funny.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.880]   And edited.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:48.560]   It's on his Facebook page.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.280]   That's what it is.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.120]   Anyway, yes, I agree with you.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.800]   Reader, what a great application.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:57.720]   Our EED are really a nice, a nice news reader for the Mac.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:59.360]   And yeah, I have it synced up with my Google.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.720]   Uh, reader.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.360]   Very nice.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.120]   Thank you, Frederick.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.120]   You're welcome.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:05.920]   Hey, gold pick.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.800]   And now and do not go and do not go.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.800]   I have kind of a quick one.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:17.560]   Um, uh, who does soft, who does software makes a couple of tools?
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.160]   A kind of big fans of recently.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.320]   I started using Huda spot.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:31.320]   H-O-U-D-A-H spot, which is not the prettiest app ever made, but it's designed to be really, really functional.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:43.800]   What it is, is it's a graphical front end to spotlight because spotlight can do all kinds of really complicated queries that are really more designed for programmers to access than for users to simply type out like a simple search query.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:50.120]   This makes it very, very easy, especially if you have, like, maybe you've got tens of thousands of files on huge hard drives.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:29:06.040]   To say, please give me every file that was created within the past three days, but not within the past two days that contains this sort of information, not exactly matching, but sort of fuzzy matching, but not if it's been modified by this application, but definitely if it's been accessed by this application.
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:14.440]   Uh, and then we'll give you a list that you can then just simply pass over to the finder for either archiving or deleting or whatever it is you want to do or just simply tagging for later use.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:19.160]   Uh, if there's, because there are times when you just wish you had someone cleverer than you.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:35.680]   Then you could simply dictate a list to saying, uh, well, well, saw, I know that I know that you're my, you're the intern and I'm supposed to give these horrible jobs to you, but I need to collect every single file that was in any way related to this book that I wrote two years ago and a spread over four different hard drives and three
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:45.320]   80 different types of files, but there is a way to describe it so that you can just do it with one or two queries. It's hard to do strictly via spotlight is actually very easy to do via who to spot.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:59.560]   You can also save these queries so that if you manage to build something kind of complex so that it will automatically organize everything that's supposed to be on your server, like all of your CSS files that are related to a specific project that use this special JavaScript tag you cooked up just for this project.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:05.120]   You can simply save it as a query so that every time you wanted to retidy that, uh, who to spot can find it for you again.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:22.360]   If I had one, uh, one really big suggestion, I really wish it could work as sort of a compiler for the spotlight query so that I could then save one of these really complicated, nicely formatted graphical searches as then a smart folder so I don't necessarily have to launch a huda spot all the time.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:27.000]   So that's the, that's the thing that sort of separates it from it. It's a 30. It's a free trial.
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:37.920]   Uh, it's $30 if you want to keep it if it had that sort of ability to save a query from who to spot as a smart folder, it would definitely be worth the 30 bucks for everybody.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:48.800]   As it is, it's for people. I think it's a really, really great tool for people who need to manage again these tens or hundreds of thousands of files in a million different places where you just find yourself crawling through folder after folder,
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:31:02.440]   directory after directory, doing multiple search after multiple search to do something that you know, spot like could do if you just were smart enough to know how to write that little bit that, that like 10 lines of apple script or that little bit of X code that could simply serve this, this stuff for you.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:12.680]   So good stuff. Uh, it'll be, it'll be a handy thing to have in your back pocket for that one time that you really want to go to the concert, but you've got eight hours for the searches to do in the next 20 minutes.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.680]   That looks great.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.200]   Who does spot?
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:15.200]   He does great stuff.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:15.280]   Who?
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:16.640]   Who?
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:20.240]   That it's, it's, it's, it's, it has his own aesthetic and his own goals.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.680]   And that's why you like to see the small developers, right?
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.120]   Each pursuing their own first, their own specific form of dementia.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:26.440]   Right.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.560]   That's exactly right.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:37.760]   And that that's kind of why closed app stores such a bad idea, you know, because Apple will say, Oh, no, that doesn't fit our, uh, are, you know, uh, idiom, idiom.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:40.520]   And, uh, and you lose out on a lot of cool stuff.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:44.360]   Uh, Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:48.760]   I would like to say that a friend of just stuck with one, this would have been a lot easier.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:52.120]   You know me above and beyond.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:52.960]   He's still your pick.
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:58.520]   We ran into, I guess we ran into a friend of the guy who actually develops reader in at Twitt cottage.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.560]   He was sitting, I ran into him when he was.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.680]   And, uh, so I'll give it a shot and so I went and bought it.
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:06.200]   And just, I love it.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:06.760]   I love it.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.280]   I want to say one thing though, right?
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.000]   Cause I didn't want to interrupt Frederick.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:16.560]   Uh, it has one feature that it desperately needs and that's the reason why I don't, I own it, but don't use it.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:23.800]   It needs a button with a question mark to explain what all these really cool, you know, Scandinavian design icons do.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.920]   Oh, over on the left.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:26.760]   I don't.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:26.880]   I don't.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:27.240]   Fund though.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.280]   And he's discovering it.
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:30.240]   Not only that, but they're too small.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:32.480]   I mean, there's, I don't have, unfortunately, I don't have my iPad.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:32.880]   We're going to need it.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:39.280]   I've actually switched over to another RSS reader that it does not try to be really, really impressive with this design.
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:40.840]   And it's just very, very functional.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.400]   The buttons are really, really big.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:46.080]   You can easily just hold your iPad horizontally with two hands and navigate it that way.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:52.160]   I don't have to sort of saying, oh boy, isn't it great that they decided to put this tiny little button up in the corner because it looks so cool.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.480]   But maybe if I can hit with my pinky, there you go.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:54.720]   Nope.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:55.400]   Didn't get there.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.080]   No, okay.
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:56.720]   No, there you go.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.240]   Now I'm looking at the Mandy Mandy.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.760]   And it's very simple.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.960]   There's a star that shows your, you're such a hater.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.960]   Your starred stuff is, that's the star.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:11.000]   There's a dot that shows unread feeds in, you know, they're all folder.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.240]   And this is universal for unread feed.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.160]   It is actually.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.480]   And then there's all these, and having all these pages and a grid is much, much, makes much, much better sense of having a list.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.640]   You can simply scroll because look at all the information that's giving you.
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:22.320]   Oh my God.
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.680]   Let's say I want.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.160]   I want.
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:24.960]   Unread.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.560]   And the unconformed.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.160]   I'm not.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.120]   I don't know.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:28.840]   Thank God.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.520]   They do this.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.800]   Unread tech news.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.680]   I press tech news.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:32.680]   I have the unread button.
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:35.120]   These are unread stories in the tech news category.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:39.520]   If I want to read them, I tap them because I don't care about blank sheets of paper.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.160]   I want to know what the name of this thing is.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:43.480]   Hasn't been updated recently, but.
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.480]   You're right.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.040]   It is a little.
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.760]   It's going to be my pick of the week.
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:47.200]   I need to.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:47.920]   I need to explain that.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.160]   I don't think it's a terrible product.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:53.360]   It's just that this is the sort of thing where the developer thinks it's finished.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.520]   He shows it to five friends.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:58.800]   The five friends tell him that I want to like it, but I can't really use it.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.320]   And then he makes a bunch of simple changes that make it into a really great product.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.440]   I will grant you that there is to me.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.240]   There is as yet no perfect RSS reader.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:12.200]   The one that I do use all the time news rack is way slow.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.040]   And maybe it's because I have millions of feeds.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:18.560]   I don't know, but I want something that's fast and I can bookmark the delicious in.
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.240]   And that's that's all I ask.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.760]   So I'm looking forward to seeing your pick next week.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:23.760]   Okay.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:24.760]   And as for you Alex Lindsey.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.760]   So so I have another one now.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:27.920]   This is for the iPad.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.200]   And so so here we have the this is.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.680]   Oh, three, two, one.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.680]   Oh, tell us.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680]   Oh, a teleprompter.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.680]   Oh, look at that.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.680]   Free it last.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.680]   Free it last.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:44.240]   So this is called teleprom plus.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:49.880]   And one of the cool things about this is that it will actually you can actually control
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.400]   it with your iPhone.
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.880]   So you can connect it via Wi-Fi to your iPhone so that you can use your iPhone to actually
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:57.640]   progress the text up.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:00.320]   And so, you know, it's a cool little app.
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.680]   And the thing is that, you know, telepromp is going to be very expensive.
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:03.680]   You already have an iPad.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:04.680]   You're on the road.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.640]   Being able to just throw one of these, you know, and there's a couple people who make
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:15.120]   are now making teleprompters that that you can slide your iPad into.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.640]   And we're actually going to show on GMT on GMT part of or actually part of a new show
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:20.640]   that we're working on.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:24.480]   So you had to build one, you know, how to build a little teleprompter around your iPad.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.000]   So so I really started getting trying to figure out what was out there.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.880]   And this is the best one that I found so far.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:30.880]   So it's called teleprompter.
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.680]   And I think it's like five bucks.
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.200]   It's really inexpensive.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:38.240]   It's amazing between stuff like movie slate, which we talked about last week, teleprompt
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.400]   from the film business, from the TV business.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:48.200]   It's amazing what all these things that were really expensive before and really a pain in
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.120]   the neck to buy and deal with it, just, you know, all finding their way onto the iPad.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:59.000]   Somebody I think somebody sent me an email there was a, I think it was a Dutch legislator
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.720]   and parliament who read his speech from an iPad and is now being censured for bringing
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:10.920]   into technology into the hallowed halls of the parliament off with his head off with
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:11.920]   his head.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:12.920]   They're investigating.
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.040]   Well, should we allow but but what a great thing for a speech.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:18.800]   You have your own factor.
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.160]   You put it here.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.160]   You press go.
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.080]   It's got big characters and you read your speech.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.880]   Well, the thing is, is that because it's scrollable, you can you can set it down.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.000]   You can be reading it.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.360]   And so if you're even if you're not going to use it as a teleprompter, if you're just
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:34.240]   going to use it as your your text, how many times are you sitting there fiddling around
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.920]   with your news with your paper?
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.640]   You know, like you're like, oh, I got to go to page three or I got to go to page four.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.400]   Now you simply just take your finger and you're looking down and reading and then you just
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.280]   scroll your finger up and move it to the move it to the next round of text.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:49.200]   It is, you know, even if you're not going to use it for a teleprompter is just something
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.760]   if you're going to do a speech or talk.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:54.400]   So whatever, it's just the perfect little application for five bucks.
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.000]   We'll change my testing once a front facing camera hits the.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.720]   I don't like teleprompters.
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.720]   I hate teleprompters.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.880]   I want to let teleprompters in my studio because it makes somebody dead.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:09.920]   But there are times when you're working like Alex does with executives who have to read
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:11.880]   copy that is the only choice.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:14.240]   It's the only option.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.840]   But podcasters beware.
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:19.240]   It'll kill it'll kill your spontaneity or reality.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.240]   Do not use a teleprompter.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.760]   He's going to know how to read.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760]   Come on.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.960]   I know how to read a teleprompter after many, many years of doing it and I can make it look
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.440]   like I'm not reading a teleprompter.
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.400]   But most people flat affect the minute they put a prompter.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.080]   If I use a teleprompter, what I really want are just notes.
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.600]   You know, I don't want to, I don't want the words that I have to read.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:42.160]   What I'm really looking for are, you know, just the things to remember that I had to say,
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.040]   especially if I'm going through something technical, you know, I.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.040]   Without looking down.
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:49.560]   Yeah, without looking down, I can just look up there and the notes are there.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:52.120]   This is the next step of the training tutorial.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.800]   This is the next whatever.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.080]   And I just know which ones they hit next.
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:59.720]   That's the only time I, I don't like it to tell me every word because I make that up
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:00.720]   on my own.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:06.840]   But Alex, it really does sound as though like bit by bit, TV production, video production
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:09.400]   and film production apps are coming onto the iPad.
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.920]   First you have the $10,000 clapper board now as a $40 app.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:18.360]   Now you have what's probably a really expensive teleprompter infrastructure as an iPad app.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.480]   Like I have other guys who are in lighting and other services have told me that now they're
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.200]   using iPads as the controllers for their sound boards and their lighting boards.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.640]   Yeah, it's going to be, if you have an iPad strapped to your back, you can actually run
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:32.640]   Hollywood now.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.680]   Well, and they haven't really done what's going to, what I think is really going to make
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:42.800]   this exciting is when you start to cloud super solid applications together because right
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:46.560]   now you have a whole bunch of people writing down on pieces of paper, you know, what the
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.800]   camera settings were and what the sound notes are and what the script notes are and everything
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.800]   else.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:55.200]   And when you centralize all of that, it's going to make a massive difference because
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:00.080]   you can have that on a cloud where the script supervisor changes the shot name and it changes
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.080]   everywhere.
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.040]   And the script, you know, script supervisor, you know, and as everyone puts the notes
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:06.440]   in, they're all coming into a central location.
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.480]   All of those things are the, you know, are the next step.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:11.600]   There's a lot of people talking about doing those things.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:15.120]   And so we're going to see this, this kind of integration between all of these different
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.040]   departments and it's, it's going to make a massive difference.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:24.600]   And it's going to be like for $5.99 and $20 and, you know, stuff that, ah, it's just,
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.600]   it's exciting.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.280]   It is, it is a sea change.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:32.720]   But don't use a prompter kids.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.320]   Take it from the old timer.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.720]   They'll kill you.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:36.720]   All right.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:40.560]   My pick, whatever you have to do, smoke all the pot, drink all you want.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.400]   Just don't use a teleprompter exactly.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:46.080]   Do what I do.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.480]   Drop ash at daily.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:51.040]   No, that's not right.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.280]   That's not right.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.280]   So I am.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.280]   Is it a bit of guilt?
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:55.280]   No, no, no.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:59.280]   I've seen some of the finest minds of my generation destroyed by teleprompter use.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.280]   That's exactly right.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:06.960]   Allen Ginsburg, many people didn't know that he was in fact a regular on the PBS in San
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.960]   Francisco.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.240]   All I, all I have to say is that, is that if you have to shoot executives, you know,
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.240]   they're not done.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.240]   No, you're not done.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.240]   You're not done.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.920]   You got to put, you got to put that in front of them or you'll be there all day to get
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:19.160]   a minute and a half.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:23.160]   I don't know guys.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.200]   One of my most, one of my favorite podcasts and one of the most entertaining podcasts
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:30.080]   that I listen to is Mac OS kin and his scripted and it sounds great and I'm happy he scripts
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:31.080]   it.
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:36.280]   So, you know, there's room for reading, I think, you know, it's not a hard and fast
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.840]   rule that you have to read, but I like, I like sometimes it have structure.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.520]   I will acknowledge that like if I script, pre scripted and edited everything I was about
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.840]   to say during every podcast, my contributions would be about six minutes, 10 seconds.
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:53.280]   Which is exactly why we ask you not to write it down.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.680]   My pick of the week is for gamers.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:55.680]   I've got two of them.
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:59.480]   First of all, I should, it would, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that electronic
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:05.880]   arts is having a 99 cent sale on its iPhone applications and they do a lot of great games
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:06.960]   over a dozen titles.
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.840]   It's only for 48 hours.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:15.040]   So this is command and conquer FIFA 10 Madden NFL need for speed shift need for speed undercover
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:21.840]   Sim City dragons, Lair Jewel quest, trivial pursuit, all 99 cents for the first time.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:27.120]   Others that they have done this before with, but are 99 cents for the next 48 hours NBA live
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:35.640]   Tiger Woods, battleship connect for surviving high school, the game of life, clue and yachty.
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:38.080]   So that's a, that's a pretty good deal.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.320]   99 cents for the next 48 hours.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.480]   I checked not on the iPad.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.480]   Sorry.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.480]   Sorry.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.400]   Oh, there goes Alex.
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:47.400]   Ass screw him.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.160]   And then, okay, we're done with him.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.760]   It was, he was, he's over.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:54.760]   I'll give him a play.
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.640]   I think it's an opportunity for the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:57.640]   rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:58.640]   I was three to look better now.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.640]   Yes.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:00.640]   Right.
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:03.360]   Out of the person who knows things and speaks with authority is gone.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.360]   We see what the wrong with Hollywood.
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:09.360]   Red Rick and Leo is, I think his model went down.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:17.720]   But the red cameras and the 412 P I interlaced gen lot time code system, I think is going
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.360]   to, it's going to have an effect.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.880]   That's mind you, me and if Alice disagrees, he should say something.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:23.880]   Nope.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.480]   And say you're absolutely right.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:26.480]   My other pick.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.720]   I don't know if we picked this before, but it's just getting better and better and better
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.720]   steam on the Mac.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:34.360]   We talked about it earlier at the update issue with the graphics, the faulty graphics
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.600]   driver that Apple was putting out.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:39.360]   But if you have a Macintosh, a late model Macintosh, even if you don't, because some
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:46.680]   of the steam games are absolutely for less powerful systems, steam has always been a
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:53.000]   stalwart on the PC side, the best way to buy games for Windows machines.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.280]   And they put it out for the Mac about a month ago.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:01.520]   And now they have really great titles like Team Fortress 2, Half Life 2 available.
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:07.200]   In fact, there are hundreds of titles now out, Civilization 4, that are equivalent to the
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:08.200]   PC version.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:13.720]   In fact, you can play when you play Team Fortress 2, you can play Windows users at parity.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.960]   They've got Eve online.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:19.800]   I've been playing Portal 2, which they were giving away for a while.
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:26.240]   If you're a gamer at all, this is a really great choice, especially if you have a later
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.240]   late model Mac.
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:33.160]   I've played on my current Mac laptop, the powerbook that I just got with that new Nvidia, was
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.320]   it a 320?
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:37.400]   And plenty of horsepower to play all of these games.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.280]   They've just done a great job.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.080]   If you haven't played Half Life 2, it's one of the best games out there.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:47.920]   And fairly affordable, you download it when you buy it on any steam platform, you get
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.720]   to keep it on all steam platforms.
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:54.160]   So if you cross platform or you have multiple Macs, it's a great way to buy a game.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.760]   And they have frequent sales on the weekends.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.160]   They should always check the prices.
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:58.640]   They're always much like electronic arts.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:00.560]   They're changing the prices all the time.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.480]   A huge selection now.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:05.720]   99 games for Macintosh.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:10.960]   Thank you, Val, for giving the Macintosh parity in terms of gaming.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:16.560]   I think they've actually single-handedly made the Mac a strong gaming platform all of a
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.000]   sudden.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.000]   So that's my pick of the week.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.920]   It's free to get steam for the Mac.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:26.280]   Time to get some power to .com.
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.520]   Alex Lindsey is not with us.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.240]   He has passed on to the great Skype in the sky.
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:35.320]   But if he were here, I'm sure he would say, make sure you go to Pixelcore.tv for all
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.320]   the great podcasts.
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.320]   I got to call him back.
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:38.320]   I can't do this.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:41.000]   One of the hostages must have overpowered him.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000]   I can't do that.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.840]   Too much time on his camera manifesto.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:49.640]   If you put that on the prompter instead of rambling on like that, you wouldn't have
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.640]   been overpowered.
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:51.640]   Exactly.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640]   You see that?
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.640]   If it's on his own petard.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.640]   We're just wrapping up, Alex.
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:58.920]   I just wanted to give you a chance to plug anything you need at Pixelcore.tv for the
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:44:59.920]   podcast, Pixelcore.com.
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:02.000]   Oh, we can't get him on.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.040]   I guess he's lost it.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.960]   Actually, the timing was perfect.
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:08.360]   Pixelcore.com, if you want to find out more about his Guild of Multimedia Artist, Frederick
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.360]   Van Johnson.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:10.360]   Ooh.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:13.440]   Professional photographer at mediabytes.com.
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.440]   Anything else you'd like to plug this week in photography?
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.520]   This week in photography, you know what?
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:24.240]   You've been remiss in having a Twitter account for this weekend photography, but it is now
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.240]   active.
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:28.400]   So you can check out that Twitter feeder, Friendus.
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:30.640]   Be like the- What is the Twitter feed?
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:32.320]   What is the Twitter feed?
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:35.640]   It is this week in photo on Twitter.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:36.640]   This week in photo.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.640]   All right.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.960]   So, Friendus there and/or friend me at Frederick Van.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.640]   I'm going to follow you.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   There you go.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:46.800]   Now following this week in photo, and of course I've been following Frederick Van for
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:47.800]   a long time.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.280]   F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K-V-A-N.
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:52.600]   Watch me be proven a liar.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.600]   Am I following?
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.600]   Yes, I am.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.600]   Look at that.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600]   There I am.
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:57.600]   Whew.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.600]   That was close.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.600]   I took a chance.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.600]   Mediabytes.com.
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.600]   Yep.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.720]   Andy Inaco is the man at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:10.160]   His great reviews are just, you know, definitive and untellopromtered.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:17.000]   You can also read his blog at www.cwob.com.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.360]   And when are we going to see that iPhone 4 review in the Chicago Sun Times?
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.080]   I have right now, right now on the lathe.
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.040]   I've got three different pieces and they're going to be coming out starting Wednesday,
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:36.400]   Thursday and Friday regarding iOS 4 and the iPhone 4.
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:39.400]   So may God have mercy upon my poor editors and souls.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:43.600]   They're going to be doing a lot of eight thousand words coming in over the transom.
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.600]   And this is his, by the way, video.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.880]   I love your shot there.
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:52.320]   Your opening shot, his video of how the keyboard doc works with the iPhone 3GS.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.360]   That's also there at www.cwob.com.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:47:01.600]   Andy Inaco, beloved technology pundit.
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:02.600]   Thanks so much.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:04.040]   Thank you so much everybody for being here.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.880]   We do this show every Tuesday morning, 11 a.m. Pacific time.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.880]   That's 2 p.m.
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.640]   Eastern 1800 UTC.

[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:36.120]   And so there's plenty of ways to get your Mac Break Weekly and I am told any day now,

[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:48.400]   And that'll put us on a bunch of devices, which is very exciting.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.640]   I think that's all I have to say.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:53.200]   If you like Mac Break Weekly, don't forget to watch Windows Weekly Thursdays at the same
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:56.800]   time and get the other side of the equation with Paul Therat.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.800]   And we do a great show on Wednesdays at this time, all about Google.
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:01.960]   So we like to cover Mac.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.160]   These are the three big platforms, Mac, Windows and the Cloud.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:07.840]   And you'll find it all here at live.twit.tv.
