[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.200]   We'll talk about Apple's quarterly rumor.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.560]   It's also, I know, was last week, but there's a lot to say
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.000]   about that rumors, about the next generation I watch,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.360]   and what we are going to see in the cameras,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.120]   in the next iPhone, it's going to blow your mind.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.920]   Plus, why Justin Trudeau is peeking out for my chest.

[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.640]   where we talk about the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.840]   Look low and behold, in studio.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.080]   I can touch him and--
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.880]   Somebody said we got to get a special effect.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.320]   Box to put around you so that you look like you're here.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.200]   It's Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.680]   He is here from Pixelpore.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.840]   All the way from Santa Feil.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.640]   Did you ride the train, the new light rail?
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.400]   No, I haven't.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.480]   It's not set up yet.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.520]   It's not really running yet.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.160]   No.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.320]   Someday you'll be able to do that, though.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.240]   Instead, I just had to ride the narrows.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.680]   Yeah, that's the worst.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.360]   Well, that's a local problem.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.040]   We won't bore people with that.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.440]   Back from his trip to New York City, Renee Ritchie is here.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.600]   He was down there talking about iOS.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.360]   Writing about iOS 11 and photography.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.880]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.080]   And I also want to point out that Alex's lip sync is perfect
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.560]   today.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.360]   That's not what I was supposed to.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.240]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.840]   How did we do that?
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.720]   We worked on that one.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.600]   Is your article up on iMore.com?
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.120]   Yes, it is.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.840]   I'll put it in the show now.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.520]   Because I really am very interested in that.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.240]   Because one of the things I'm thinking about
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.360]   is instead of bringing a laptop on my next trip,
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.680]   bringing an iPad with iOS 11 on it, the 10.5 Mac--
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560]   Can I do it?
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.280]   You only can't do it.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.640]   It's a portrait boat.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.360]   I don't care.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.920]   No, I want to bring a camera.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.000]   I want to bring a camera, although having a nice camera.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.040]   But I'm thinking for all the post and selection
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.160]   and triage and all that stuff.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.000]   And I really haven't used Lightroom on the iPad.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.880]   Do you like it?
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.840]   Yeah, I'll talk about that in a second.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.040]   The interface is weird, but it's good.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.600]   It's a really bad.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.720]   He's the guy to ask.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.840]   Also with another guy who is an avid photographer
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.920]   and Mac Fina--
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.360]   Aficionado.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.720]   I can't even think of the word now.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.080]   Aficionado.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.760]   Mr. Andy Naco from the Chicago--
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.200]   All I care about is that you pressed my name right?
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.000]   That's all I care about.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.840]   Hell, the other words don't matter.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.320]   I have no idea how to spell it, but I do know how to pronounce it.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.040]   And not co.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, right after the show last week,
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.200]   they do it.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.080]   They do it every time.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   Apple announced its results.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.040]   And a bit of a surprise.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.040]   Because you were on assignment, were you
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.960]   able to listen to the call anyway and do your traditional?
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.440]   I listened to it while walking the streets of New York City.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.960]   But we-- and Serenity Caldwell is a way
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.400]   defending the honor of Canada in the roller derby world
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.920]   championships or something in Europe.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.480]   Congratulations.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.680]   She's doing-- her team is doing great, so fingers crossed.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.040]   So we had Lori Gill, Mike Asargent, and Joe Keller
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.880]   stepping in for us.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.440]   And they did a phenomenal job.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.960]   So there were surprises, right?
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.680]   Apple did better in this quarter, its third fiscal quarter,
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.600]   than it normally does.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.680]   This is usually the slow quarter, right?
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.880]   Yeah, I'm getting to that age.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.320]   I don't know if it's just me being disgruntled by all this
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.520]   stuff.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.200]   But a lot of it is just math.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.040]   It's like, how many weeks are in the month?
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.480]   What happened last year in the year-to-year compares?
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.400]   Was there a surplus?
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.680]   Was there a shortage?
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.560]   Did people upgrade early?
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.760]   Did they upgrade late?
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.280]   And everyone is breathless about these things.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.320]   But then when you go after the call or two or three hours
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.960]   after the call is like, oh, this is why all that happened.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.040]   They're making more money than anybody.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.560]   It just keeps happening.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.080]   Well, you see how spiky their revenue is in this graph
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.840]   from Mac rumors.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.320]   It's really-- in the last few years,
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.920]   it's all about iPhones.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.680]   And it's highly predictable.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.240]   The big spikes, though, and notice, they're up every single
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.440]   fourth quarter.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.760]   Those are the fourth quarter spikes.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.920]   And it's because of the iPhone sales.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.840]   Now, there's somebody-- some people have been saying that Apple's
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.360]   going to try to move iPhone sales out of the--
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.800]   because they usually only get a week or two
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.040]   in the last quarter of iPhone sales,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   move it all fully into the first quarter
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.680]   by delaying the release of the next iPhones to October.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.680]   You think that's reasonable?
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.520]   I don't think they do that for Wall Street.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.600]   I mean, there's a myriad of reasons they might have to do that.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.400]   But they've been doing this for years.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.000]   And I think that idea probably occurred to Tim Cook second 0.01.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.800]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.280]   They're not dumb.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.640]   Yeah, Apple's at an all-time high as we begin the show.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.560]   The chatroom's telling me $161.10, which is kind of remarkable.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.000]   Does that put them in the trillion dollar to the trillion dollar?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.520]   Not yet.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.000]   They're getting close.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.880]   They're getting there.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.280]   And I agree with you.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.680]   And I think in quarters is really not--
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.360]   this is one of the problems in America
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.400]   is that businesses are kind of by the markets required
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.360]   to think in terms of quarterly results.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.320]   When that isn't really how you should be thinking of it.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.960]   And growth.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.800]   I mean, if Apple makes a gazillion dollars
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.480]   and they don't make a gazillion point two next year,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.880]   you're going to make it gazillion point one.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.160]   We don't want money.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.760]   We want the possibility of future money
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.360]   we don't actually have yet.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.880]   Big news.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.360]   Yeah, also it feels a little bit less important
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.680]   because with other companies, a bad quarter
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.520]   means that a CEO is no longer CEO.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.920]   Apple, they have to have a lot of bad quarters
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.120]   before they have to answer to anybody.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.760]   But God, even God would be like, I'm
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.520]   going to hang with you for another three years just in case
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.400]   you do wind up with that 3D sensing phone.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.960]   But until then, why wouldn't you really if you were--
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   Got an upgrade coming.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.560]   The stock went up quite a bit, of course,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.440]   after the results were announced.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.520]   And the reason it's high is it's staying high.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.640]   Let me get some more of these charts here.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.600]   The current at this current market cap is $832 billion.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.520]   So they still got a way to go if you're going to hit.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.160]   The fun part for me-- and I don't know if I'm jumping too
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.040]   far ahead of you-- is when they gave the projections
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.240]   for next quarter, everyone just stopped and said,
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.880]   wait a minute, those projections seem to include new iPhone
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.840]   sales, which usually is a no-brainer.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.800]   But there was so many rumors about delays,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.920]   and they couldn't do it.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.680]   It'd be pushed out to this quarter or that quarter or this year.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.000]   And it turns out maybe not so much.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.840]   Boy, if you bought Apple stock one year ago,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.240]   you would have seen a $50 share increase over the last year
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.160]   alone.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.600]   And this is when everyone said that they were in trouble.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   Yeah, panic.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.760]   Well, OK.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.320]   But I do want to say that there's a difference
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.480]   between how the stock market does and the long-term future
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.960]   of a company.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.320]   And Apple is absolutely firing on all cylinders
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.520]   right now with the iPhone.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.200]   But that doesn't mean that in three years,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.640]   it's going to look like this.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:54.920]   Now--
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.200]   They were worried about then.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.640]   They were worried about that quarter.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.480]   Apple's down.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.400]   Apple's going to stay down.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.640]   The talk is never going to bounce back.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.520]   No, that's true.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.640]   Also, it's important just to keep in mind that Apple stock
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.120]   is an Apple product.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.800]   So you can have a bad performing Apple product.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.200]   But that doesn't mean that they still
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.920]   aren't going to make lots of money off of the Macs
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.800]   and lots of money off of the iPhones and everything else.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.200]   Well, and that was one of the good news features
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.480]   of this quarterly report is iPad sales showing
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   some real strength.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.520]   I think both the new iPad Pros, the 10.5 inch,
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:33.000]   and the strength of the $329 entry level iPad
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   showed for the first time in a long time an increase
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.080]   in iPad unit sales.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.320]   My misremembering, but didn't the ASP suggest
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.720]   that it was the entry level iPad that was really, I guess,
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.160]   getting a lot of people to turn over?
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.840]   It was mostly the fact you get a $329 iPad.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.280]   And it prompted all those long long in the wallet
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.480]   in the pocket to upgrades.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.640]   Unit sales up 28% over the previous quarter,
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.480]   15% year over year.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.320]   We haven't seen growth like that in the iPad
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.680]   in a couple of years.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.120]   And you don't see that growth like that in most mature markets.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.120]   That was a good point.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.200]   It's been out for a long time.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.240]   So that kind of jump.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.360]   And I think that maybe some of it was pent up.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.160]   People didn't really--
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.400]   A lot of the iPads didn't--
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.360]   my kids would use an iPad 2 or an iPad or a newer iPad.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.960]   And they didn't really notice the difference
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.760]   when they're playing Minecraft or doing whatever.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.240]   And I think that one of the things we may see, especially
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.160]   as we move forward with AR, with some of the other things
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.040]   that are going to push the processors harder,
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.280]   that you may see a larger growth in the iPad
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.480]   because there's going to be apps that are really
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.000]   taking advantage of the chip systems,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.800]   rather than kind of staying with a vast majority of the apps
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.160]   are not taking full advantage of the hardware.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.640]   And I think that's what also affects the sales.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.640]   Highest global market share in four years in markets
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.280]   like China and Japan, Tim Cook said,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.200]   over half of the iPads are sold to people
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.640]   buying their first iPad.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.560]   So some of the growth is new markets.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.080]   But I have to say, I think that new iPad Pro combined
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.800]   with iOS 11, I know you're going to talk about that a little bit
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.000]   later, Renee.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.240]   Really is impressive.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.120]   That is--
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.120]   Even--
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.800]   --coming a vage for the iPad.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.300]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.760]   And it's the same thing we'll probably
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.760]   talk about with the iPhone later,
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.520]   is that they're attacking the market from multiple fronts.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.320]   The low-cost iPad appeals to people
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.040]   who have had an iPad 2 and 1 upgrade,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.280]   but also people who have bought crappy video tablets
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.080]   and just have had a terrible experience with them.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.680]   And I think Tim Cook in previous years
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.960]   has said that they're happy to be someone's second purchase.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.080]   Because there are every Christmas Android Central
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.920]   is flooded with people who bought a crappy $50 tablet
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.440]   at whatever big box store or online provider.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.120]   And it just doesn't work.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.280]   They get really upset.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.000]   And at the price of the new iPad,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.200]   I think some of them are willing to go a little bit higher
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.040]   just to get something they think will work.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.920]   Also big news.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.240]   And Tim talked a lot about augmented reality.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.240]   And he pointed out-- and this is undeniable--
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.840]   with hundreds of millions of people actively
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.800]   using the iPhone and iPad today, iOS
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.480]   will instantly become the world's biggest augmented reality
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.720]   platform as soon as iOS 11 ships.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.120]   Is 11 works better on newer--
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.080]   the presumed new iPhone and the new iPad?
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.320]   But it works still on other older devices.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.360]   Yeah, anything 64-bit?
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.320]   OK.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.800]   So yeah, so the iPhone 5S and newer--
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.320]   I really think the limiting factor for AR
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.240]   is going to be frame rate more than anything else.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.440]   Because once you get the frame rate down, AR
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.560]   starts to break a little bit.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.040]   That's really assessment my experience.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.840]   So the question, though, going back to something
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.760]   you said a moment ago, is whether there's
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.480]   going to be such a big AR hit like Pokemon Go
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.520]   that the difference between my iPad
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.920]   will run Pokemon Go, my old iPad--
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.080]   and since this person's iPad will not run Pokemon Go.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.440]   If that will be the sort of thing that gets people who
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.240]   were maybe open to upgrading for the past couple of years
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   to finally get down the Apple Store with an open wallet.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.560]   I think one of the things-- we're
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.880]   doing a lot of AR work right now.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.520]   And one of the things that we've noticed
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.240]   is that what's going to start pushing these in a lot of ways
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.120]   is also a polygon count.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.400]   So right now, we find that the performance
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.200]   gets pretty chunky on a variety of platforms
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.080]   at about 1 and 1/2 million polygons, which is still--
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.280]   I mean, I used to build game models in the '90s when
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.800]   I had to make something in 256 polygons.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.560]   So a million and 1,000,000 and 1/2.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.800]   I mean, we barely rendered for the movie I worked on.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.560]   We barely rendered anything over a million polygons.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.160]   So the idea that's in real time, it's quite a thing.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.520]   But however, it's more than frame rate or resolution
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.160]   that's going to make or break AR kit.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.600]   Really good article by a guy named Daniel Eckler, who's
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.040]   been working in augmented reality for many years now,
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.840]   explaining-- this is on Medium.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:57.520]   It's in the startup on Medium explaining the technology of AR.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.320]   And actually, this may not be the article I was thinking of.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.360]   There's one that talks about the technology.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.680]   And the real issue with AR is not so much a frame rate.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.000]   Of course, that's going to be important.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.560]   The quality of the image being superimposed
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.520]   on the real world.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.720]   But the real difficult thing to do-- and the thing
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.120]   that demos always overstate, because he says,
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.080]   don't ever trust an AR YouTube demo,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.960]   because you're seeing only when it worked perfectly--
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.160]   is that placing that thing in the real world,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.960]   placing it on tables so it's like it's on a table, placing it
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.600]   so it can move behind things.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.560]   That's very difficult.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.160]   All of these things are computationally
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.240]   incredibly difficult to do.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.480]   And that is going to be the, I think, ultimate test
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.760]   of consumer acceptance is whether it just looks like Pokemon
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.640]   go, just, there's nothing to do there.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.880]   It's just a thing floating on the street.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.880]   But if it actually is interacting with the real world--
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.280]   And this is the stuff that we've encountered.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.840]   Yeah, in visual effects, we call this match moving.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.080]   So match moving is something that--
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.600]   Match moving, yes, right.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.200]   We're trying to sync somebody in--
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.320]   and the problem really in match moving
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.160]   is that it's either 100% correct or it's zero,
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.320]   because it's sliding.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.280]   And so it's unacceptable.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.760]   And so you really do get into these situations.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.120]   And of course, you have to decide
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.920]   what the resolution of the tracking needs to be
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.240]   for a given piece, but generally it
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.560]   has to be highly accurate.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   And especially with AR it has to be highly accurate.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.720]   And so those are a mixture of processing the pixels
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.280]   that are there.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.080]   But the laser helps a lot, because right now,
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.280]   the pixels are really good at planes.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.920]   That's what most of what AR kit that we've seen so far
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.640]   is saying, I know where the table is.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.360]   I know where the floor is.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.120]   But AR doesn't-- AR kit right now
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.640]   doesn't have a really good sense of scale.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.000]   It doesn't have a sense of position.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.640]   Whereas when you look at the Tango platform,
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.960]   you're dealing with something that
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.000]   is actually can see the space that it's in
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.240]   and make some choices on that.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:46.960]   So that's the point.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   And this is the article.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.600]   And I apologize.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.320]   It's Matt Miesenix from also from Media
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.200]   of Super Venture Blog.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.880]   Why AR kit is better?
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.640]   And what he does say, in fact, is that Tango and AR
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.880]   kit are very similar.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.560]   But the reason Tango hasn't taken off,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.520]   that's the Google solution.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.120]   Because Google doesn't control the hardware platform.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.800]   You just can't get it.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.320]   I mean, we had that--
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.280]   Well, that's because it doesn't control the hardware
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:06.280]   platform.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.320]   Our Tango phone came from eBay.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.160]   We just ordered the Asus Zenphone AR.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.640]   That's actually the Tango phone.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.960]   So this is the first widely available real phone plus Tango.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.360]   And that's the one we have.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:18.920]   We've got it in Tango.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.360]   What do you think?
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.240]   Does it do well?
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.800]   It does well.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.360]   It does well.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.240]   It is-- we're using both Tango and Daydream as well as the AR
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:25.560]   kit.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.280]   And it definitely does well.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.360]   And again, in trying to generate 3D--
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.880]   now we're doing a couple of funky things with it.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.040]   But I think Tango is a more accurate solution.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.920]   But again, it also really--
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.440]   Not available.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.360]   Well, it's unavailable.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.560]   It eats up battery.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.120]   And I think that--
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.920]   Right.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.720]   But I think that these two may--
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.480]   when we look at all the rumors that are kind of floating
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.800]   around, I think that the difference between Tango and AR
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.440]   kit will be significantly smaller after the release
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.840]   of the iPhone 8 than it is right now.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.320]   Matt says--
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.120]   Matt, I highly recommend reading this.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.160]   And of course, you know all this.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.760]   But Matt's been working in AR for nine years.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.720]   He says technology is identical to AR kit.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.240]   But the title of his article is why AR kit is better
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.600]   than the alternatives.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.800]   And a lot of it is because Apple-- and they've always said,
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.360]   this controls the full stack, the hardware and the software.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.640]   And you've got 100 million plus devices that
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.360]   are going to suddenly be able to use this.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.760]   So if you're a developer, you immediately say, well,
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.480]   there's no question.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.280]   Am I going to develop for Tango or are I going to develop
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.120]   for AR kit?
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.800]   There's no question.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.280]   Well, it depends.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.480]   It could be something like Google Glass for Enterprise,
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:37.880]   where Google could be perfectly happy creating
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.600]   the AR platform that the military will definitely
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.120]   want to use.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.240]   The government will want to-- definitely want to use.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.080]   Engineers will definitely want to use.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.640]   It won't be quite so good for putting cartoon monsters
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.080]   on a park bench and then throwing a baseball at it.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.040]   But it will be really, really good for putting online
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.640]   documentation and walking less skilled workers
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.120]   through what would be a very, very complicated repair job
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.400]   or something that would allow a camera manufacturer to suddenly
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.320]   have incredible effects available to consumers that
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.480]   would be just crazy to contemplate two or three years ago.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.600]   So I think that the most important feature of AR kit
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.280]   or any augmented reality is going
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   to be presenting to a general user something that
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.720]   is just compelling and useful and relevant.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.840]   But that's the risk.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.200]   And if it doesn't look good, it's going to end up like VR has,
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.080]   which is, oh, a very promising technology.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.040]   We thought this was great.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:38.720]   We all tried it.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.000]   And then it was like, yeah, fine.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.920]   Well, I mean, there's such a thing--
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.400]   that's a good point, but there is such a thing as good enough.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.560]   Maybe people don't necessarily want the photorealistic--
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.080]   I agree.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.280]   You have to get the good enough.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.800]   I mean, exactly.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.960]   But maybe what they really want is what if I have iMovie
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.880]   and I have the ability to simply tag--
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.040]   every face that's recognized will actually
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.680]   have a little caption that follows this person around.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.160]   Or what if my daughter really, really loves Wonder Woman
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.040]   and I want her interacting with Wonder Woman
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.720]   and I can just simply download a plugin or a model for iMovie
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.720]   that will put Wonder Woman in the scene.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.200]   And maybe they can't actually talk
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.120]   because that would be very, very expensive.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.400]   I don't know how much gig costs for looping 8 million kids
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.680]   videos per day.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.760]   But what excites me about ARKit above tango.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.320]   I love the precision of tango.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.840]   I love what it could do to actually create, again,
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.920]   more practical functional solutions.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.960]   But I like the idea that ARKit is--
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.400]   you know what?
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.240]   It's as if Apple is saying, we have no idea what
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.040]   augmented reality is good for.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.240]   And that's right, actually.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.120]   We have absolutely the last clue on how to actually monetize
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.480]   this.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.680]   We just thought, what the hell?
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.960]   What if we just introduce an API that's not perfect by any means?
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.000]   But we'll allow a lot of people to try a lot of things.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.480]   And if it has an effect on tango by saying,
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.040]   would it be great if this really great ruler app that simply
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.760]   lets you on the iPhone that lets you take a measurement
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.880]   of a window just by holding up your phone to it
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.440]   and reading a measurement that's off of it,
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.000]   what if that were accurate to the millimeter instead
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.760]   of accurate to within an inch?
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.400]   And what if we-- because that's one of the most downloaded
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.760]   apps on the app store right now, looking forward
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.760]   to two or three months in the future.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.080]   So that's why I think that in the history of augmented reality
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.720]   ARKit is going to be more important from what I see right
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.680]   now than tango is, because it'll kickstart
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.680]   all that sort of innovation and idea thinking.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.520]   We can't forget Microsoft's and HoloLens,
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.080]   but it's not going to be another year and a half or two
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.320]   years, they said 2019.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.360]   But Mike says in this article that arguably HoloLens
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.800]   has the best hardware, but it's not a player.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.520]   Similarly, Tango's not a player, because Google never really
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.320]   made it a platform.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.160]   He said, had Google made Tango ubiquitous
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.040]   on Android, it would look like iPhone was playing catch up.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.720]   A hard part is, again, the performance issues
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   and so on and so forth.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.800]   Everybody's just getting started.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.440]   I think that the new iPhone will be designed
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.080]   to respond to those performance questions.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.520]   I think so.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.720]   I think that it--
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.520]   It's going to be built for that.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:05.840]   Right.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   And I think that ARKit is definitely
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.840]   much easier to develop for.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.160]   So if you're going to do something first,
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.560]   you're going to do it on ARKit.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.080]   Tango's going to give you some tools
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.480]   that you don't have right now.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.600]   The good news is, is that a lot of your development
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.560]   is not being done in Xcode or into something else.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.440]   You're doing it in Unity or Unreal Engine,
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.720]   and then you're figuring out how you customize it
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.520]   for the export.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.240]   So a lot of the development is not
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.760]   going to be either or.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.520]   Most of the stuff that we're looking at is both.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.200]   It's not-- just make sure that it works on everything
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.040]   that's out there.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.680]   You don't need to make that choice very often,
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.800]   because the real challenge with most of the AR and VR,
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.680]   at least the stuff that we're working on,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.440]   is really all the backend development of figuring out
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.480]   how you're going to acquire the data, how you're going to build
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:51.920]   it out.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.760]   And the actual-- the only thing that you really
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.840]   have to worry about for the platform
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.720]   is how you're interfacing with that information.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.080]   So I don't think people are going to have to make choices.
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.360]   But again, our pattern right now is still
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.960]   to build stuff for ARKit and see if it works really quickly.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.880]   And then go into Tango, unless we're
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.400]   trying to do precision.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.640]   We need to know exactly where we are in the space.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.240]   Good article.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.520]   Highly recommend it.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.080]   It's a great article.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.520]   I read that.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.000]   I read that.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.760]   I read that a whole bunch.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.480]   There's a lot of really-- for somebody like me who doesn't
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.400]   work as you do deeply with this stuff,
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.000]   this is a very good basic introduction
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.280]   to how AR works, why Apple has an advantage.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.000]   And it's chiefly because they have the hardware and software
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.440]   platforms together.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.040]   And what a challenge it is.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.000]   One of the things he says is there are only about 20 people
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.320]   in the world who have the skills to build this kind of hardware.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.000]   But most of them are working building cruise missile tracking
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.560]   systems or Mars Rover navigation systems that
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.760]   are working in consumer mobile.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.760]   And most of that, I think, in that specific thing,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.040]   I think was a lot of the inertial stuff.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.120]   That's where the real challenge is.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.480]   Well, there's also a huge challenge
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.760]   in doing it with a single RGB camera, which is going to go away.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.120]   And I think that we're going to--
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.840]   He says that's 18 months off, at least.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.600]   So we're not going to see the really--
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.920]   and that's maybe why HoloLens, why Microsoft said,
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.880]   you know what?
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.520]   We're not going to try to ship a consumer product till 2019.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.360]   That's when the hardware will really be there.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.000]   And when we look at VR also, HD came out in Japan in the '80s.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.320]   We didn't really see it in any kind of penetration
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.800]   until for 20 years later.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.880]   And so I think that a lot of this stuff
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.320]   is very much in its very early stages of what's going on here.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.920]   And I think that things are going to get pretty interesting.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.720]   Because we have a lot of very large companies
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.600]   that are all fighting for space, which
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.800]   is really good for us as consumers.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   It's kind of an interesting observation, though, about HD.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.640]   Maybe it was a feature that consumers were delighted to get
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.600]   for free.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.680]   They weren't en masse, entirely motivated
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.960]   to pay extra for it before it was impossible to buy a TV that
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.720]   wasn't at least 720 HD.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.960]   Maybe that's going to be the truth of AR2,
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.880]   that it's not going to be something that people are going
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.440]   to be willing to buy something to get.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.920]   If it's built into a phone, they're
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.880]   really happy to get it for free.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.240]   And then, consequently, subsequently, they're
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.520]   happy to then buy content that uses AR.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.640]   So again--
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   I think the real use is--
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.920]   I think a lot of the uses are not
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.760]   going to be individuals buying AR.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.200]   I think it's going to be locations and people and companies
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.840]   using AR as a marketing tool, as an information tool.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.960]   Well, like IKEA's proposed app, which
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.600]   would let you look at your room and put IKEA furniture in it.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.920]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.560]   That doesn't have to be perfect.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.680]   It's OK if the chair is floating a little bit.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.040]   You still can kind of get a sense
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.680]   what that furniture would look like,
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.960]   how it would fit into your room.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.920]   I think for IKEA, that's a no-brainer.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.200]   That's a great product.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.560]   And again, if you look at the other end of that,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.400]   let's just take real estate for just a second.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.880]   Maybe IKEA builds a bunch of all their furniture,
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.080]   or pottery barn builds all their furniture in 3D,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.920]   ready for a platform, ready to show it.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.040]   The real estate agent goes in and acquires
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.760]   all the information of the house,
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.800]   both lighting models and data.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.840]   And then, for sense it.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.240]   Now, you can sit there and you can say,
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.320]   I want to put this furniture in, I want to look at it,
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.240]   and I can see what it looks like.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.000]   Those are the kind of things that are not that far away.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.640]   Again, it's not being paid for by the consumer,
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.520]   but selling the house.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.920]   That's the tango style mapping where you pre-map a space.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.000]   It's now a model which you could then send to a customer
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.080]   with in some-- this is what the paint job will look like.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.240]   And you really have-- then they can really envision it
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.600]   any way they want to envision it,
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.280]   and all of that stuff's there.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.840]   And a lot of us have talked about that for 15 years.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.840]   It's just that the technology is finally getting up to speed.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.720]   And acquiring the house with tango
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.280]   would be very slow and cumbersome,
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.760]   but there are really good tools for that
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.600]   that are much faster.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.560]   We just need drones.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.400]   We need drones.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.240]   They have them.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.080]   They go and map the whole thing.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.880]   I saw that in Alien.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.480]   I know you can do it.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.320]   The LiDAR drones are about 15,000 each.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:50.840]   Oh, dude.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.040]   Nevermind.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   So they're out there.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.920]   No, but you can--
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.440]   I just-- here's my concern, and you guys
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.560]   can tell me whether you think it's on or not.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.840]   I think VR ended up being a disappointment.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.240]   And I think by overselling VR, Facebook and other companies
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.200]   have actually damaged what VR will become in the future.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.360]   And I think there's a risk here that by overselling AR,
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.640]   when consumers get their hands on it,
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.800]   that it's going to be like VR or 3D TV,
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.520]   they're going to go, oh, gimmick, nice, but I don't care.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.040]   And that would damage what will happen in 18 months or whatever.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.600]   Well, and we've been playing with AR for a while.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.920]   And these are AR maps, and people have stuff--
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   This is not new stuff.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.400]   No, it's not.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.680]   But the problem was when it was only inertial--
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.200]   and we talked about this years ago--
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.680]   as soon as they start tracking the points,
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.840]   we were going to get a much better version of this.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.800]   And the thing is, is that I think it's going to be one of the things
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.360]   you're going to use AR as often as you look at Google Maps.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.560]   Once it's good enough.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.640]   And I don't think it would be--
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.320]   I'm just saying that the risk is short term.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.960]   If it's crappy and it's just a gimmick.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.720]   And I think that's the challenge for ARKit.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.640]   Without the laser that I think we're going to end up--
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.320]   the rumor is we're going to start seeing those--
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.040]   In the new iPhone?
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.320]   I think we're going to see some more
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.000]   depth information from the new iPhone.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.760]   I mean, I think that--
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.480]   It's pretty clear that they're designing this around AR.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.600]   Yeah, so I think that you're--
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.400]   I think you're going to see that.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.520]   I think from the rumors that we've seen so far going by--
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.840]   and I think that if we get that,
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.560]   that data is pretty accurate pretty quickly.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.520]   I think the challenge with AR is that right now, when you're testing it,
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.200]   it slides around.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.880]   It's trying to find things.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.120]   The finding planes is difficult.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.160]   It's very hard with a single sensor to get to be accurate.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.800]   And VR's problem was it made people in the last years.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.360]   AR is not going to make people nauseous.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.320]   You're not wearing it.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.480]   It's not your entire world.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.760]   I think VR has a whole bunch of problems with someone who shoots a lot of it.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.200]   Making people nauseous is a pretty big problem.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.680]   Yeah, I mean, that's a frame rate issue.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.320]   I know I understand whatever.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.280]   I mean, there's convergence.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.960]   I mean, there may be other reasons for it.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.680]   But for whatever reason, if somebody tries VR and gets sick,
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.160]   they're much less likely to try it again.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.880]   I mean, that's kind of the end of that for that person.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.680]   But I think that the, again, frame rates are a big issue with that nauseousness
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.360]   of the frame rate and interoculars,
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.120]   interaxial distance for the camera.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.160]   But a parent interocular distance is the other two things that cause that problem.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.600]   They always say that and they say, "Oh, the new one's got so much frame rate
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.040]   and still makes people sick, though."
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.880]   It's the-- Yeah.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.720]   Simulator sickness.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.520]   So part of that super high resolution is so high resolution, it makes people sick.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.440]   Well, it's too good now.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.840]   One of the big problems with VR video is that to make things look more 3D,
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.200]   people who acquire it will create an interaxial distance.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.840]   The distance between the virtual cameras, they'll spread that out a little bit
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.040]   because it makes everything more 3D.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   But when you take it off, you're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.160]   That's right.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.080]   And so keeping that interaxial to a really comfortable level,
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.280]   things don't look as impressive.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.720]   They don't look as 3D, but when you take it off,
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.960]   you can always tell if it's a good acquisition,
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.400]   when you can take the goggles off and it doesn't feel like you pop your eyes pop.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.040]   Right.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.160]   When your eyes pop, that means that someone stretched it too far.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.160]   If it looks flat, then they didn't stretch it enough.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.320]   And those are the things that people--
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.920]   again, they damage the platform when they try to push it further than what it's ready to go.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.600]   But I think that most people, like what we're looking at is integrated solutions,
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.720]   where we're not thinking about AR/VR, we're thinking about AR and VR.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.200]   Like if everything we do, we're going to capture that data.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.760]   But I think everyone's-- I think that's the future of--
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.160]   you're going to-- because it's really hard as acquiring all that data.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.560]   It's not hard to make it put it on your headset.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:29.760]   And so acquiring all that data properly and really with high accuracy is going to help AR,
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.920]   but it's also-- people will use it later for VR.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.880]   Or anything else from the quarterly results we should note?
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.120]   No, again, the big thing to me was just how aggressive--
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.960]   maybe aggressive is the wrong way, but how good the forecast for next quarter were.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.960]   And it seemed to include all sorts of good stuff, I think.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.680]   Very bullish.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.640]   And we had the best Apple Watch quarter ever, but it's an Amazon number.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.760]   So nobody really knows.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.520]   Yeah, the Amazon number was 50%--
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.800]   we had a 50% increase.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.760]   It was the best quarter ever over what we don't know.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.480]   No, we don't know.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.680]   But they mean they're selling-- I forget Ben Beherrin had a number, but it was still--
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.880]   they're firing on all cylinders right now.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.680]   I have to say, I--
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   I--
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.480]   --makes were up.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.560]   As much as I think the Apple Watch is not a very interesting product,
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.720]   I see more and more of them all the time.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.560]   I see a lot of non-geeky, normal people wearing them all the time.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.480]   So the consciousness of the watch and desire for the watch has definitely penetrated the market.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.120]   If we just--
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:21.920]   And there was some fear.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.080]   Well--
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   There was some fear when they discontinued the iPods.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.040]   People were like, what are we going to use for athletics and for running?
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:32.160]   And I think more clearly with the rumors towards future, Apple watches that this is going to sort
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.840]   of take the place of the thing that was under the iPod touch.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.960]   Andy, as we go forward.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.560]   You had something to say.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.160]   Oh, no, I was just going to say, I think that just reflects that Apple is--
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.640]   no, Apple knows now what they're selling.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.120]   Right.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.520]   They were selling it earlier for the--
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.040]   actually for maybe the first two years to believers, to people who say,
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.920]   we have-- people are lining up to say, oh, we have great faith that whatever a smart watch is,
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.800]   it's going to be great.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.760]   We're going to love it.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.480]   Now Apple is saying, this is a really great fitness watch.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.320]   And it also is a really good fashion watch.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.600]   And if you like fashion and you don't mind being a little bit fitter,
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.560]   give us $300 so we can help you on both accounts.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.120]   We will talk about the watch because there's rumors that there will be a new watch
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.720]   in the two months or a month.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.320]   But we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.800]   Mark Gurman, usually very accurate.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.680]   I did want to mention the one last piece of the analyst call.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.280]   This is Jason Snell writing at Macworld.com.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.000]   Almost every analyst calls someone, tries to trick Apple executives
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.920]   and revealing their secret plans.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.720]   So this time it was RBC Capital Markets and meet Daria Nani who asked,
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.360]   should we believe the blogs and the component suppliers that the new iPhone might be delayed?
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:45.200]   Tim Cook said, we have no comment on anything that's not announced to which Daria Nani
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.880]   replied fair enough.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.400]   I figured it was worth a shot.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.520]   And then I love this.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.320]   The microphones in Cooper Tino picked up an entire room full of Apple executives laughing out loud.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.800]   There was try.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.960]   I mean, nice try.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.000]   There was one other thing that was interesting when they asked him about automation because
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.800]   he's been more willing to talk about automation.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.040]   Sort of like he was willing to talk about augmented reality than Apple typically is about
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.920]   future products.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.760]   And he was pretty clear that automation like augmented reality, they're not thinking about one product.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.080]   So maybe a car is an obvious one, but they're thinking about automation across a wide,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.160]   as like an import technology like AR.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:25.200]   Well, and as Alex just pointed out, the LiDAR and the things that map
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:31.360]   the road for self-driving cars have absolute practicality in AR and other things.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.040]   Well, there is a kind of a beneficial and on the LiDAR market, like I just created a cheaper,
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.480]   relatively cheaper LiDAR system.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:46.000]   That was Google's big lawsuit against Waymo and Lewandowski is that he'd stolen the cheap,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.960]   because Google's LiDAR is one tenth what it costs for the regular LiDAR.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.360]   And they said he gave it to Uber.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.320]   That's why there's so much.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.680]   And this is one that just scans the room or an accident scene or whatever.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.440]   And it's $16,000 for this little, what they call it.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.560]   A lot of people are calling it a coffee can.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.000]   It's like this little LiDAR system.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.360]   So it's a static LiDAR system.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.520]   You said it on a tripod and you scanned stuff, but because of AR,
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.200]   the demand for this thing is it's a 20-week waiting period for them to--
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.040]   Now these are very high precision instruments, so it's hard to get them anyway.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.320]   But it's hard to just increase the number that you're going to make.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   So like I can only make them at a certain base.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.960]   And it doesn't make a picture of their mixer with three models.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.920]   It'll do a picture as well.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.720]   Because it uses the picture to-- it can use it as mostly to color the--
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.240]   The textures for the model.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.720]   Because what it does is it goes out and grabs a whole bunch of points.
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.120]   Because I'm just going to grab all these points and then it colors all the points
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.960]   based on the color that it's scanning.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.400]   So that it kind of looks like a room.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.280]   Oh, it looks on a high density scan.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.000]   It'll look like the room.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.400]   There's just no real surface to it.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.840]   And then you run it through another conversion to put surfaces to the points.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.280]   And of course you have one.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:53.920]   I don't have one.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.880]   I don't have--
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:55.680]   I don't have--
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.800]   I said you picked this week.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.720]   Yeah, no, no, I don't have one.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.920]   I don't have a--
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.920]   I have friends with LiDAR.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.960]   Oh, 700 alexes.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.720]   No more than that.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.160]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:06.640]   We'll come back.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.560]   We will talk about Mark Gurman in the next watch.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.800]   Get your impressions.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.240]   Renee Richie is here.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.200]   From Canada, by the way, Renee, I wore something for you today.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.000]   Oh, last ones.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.600]   This is my new t-shirt that represents how we feel about Canada here in the United States of America.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.560]   Messier, Trudeau.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.280]   Exelam, with the moose and the polar bear and the goose.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.360]   And we've decided that Serenity Caldwell riding the polar bear over here.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.480]   I mean, the moose over here.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:35.840]   With her skate.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.320]   That's awesome.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:36.720]   That's terrific.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.360]   Thank you, LiDAR.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.320]   Oh, Canada.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.960]   I got that at headlines.com if you want your own.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.080]   I should send you one.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.280]   You too can get you just for sure.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.600]   But I think it's fair that Americans should wear this, right?
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.720]   And then when I--
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.200]   Holy.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:49.680]   When I go--
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.640]   Apparently, they're using--
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.160]   What was it?
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   The--
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   The--
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   The--
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   The--
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:58.240]   Roger's Stadium or something in Toronto to accommodate all the people fleeing the United States
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.920]   to become Canadian refugees?
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.480]   It's really common.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.280]   Do you see that?
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:01.840]   We have all--
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.800]   We have all the land up to the North Pole.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.480]   We are set for everybody.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.560]   Do you have anywhere that doesn't have a cold winter?
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.400]   We cling to the border for warmth.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.840]   If you would just install a heat pump,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.920]   if you could install a heat pump at the Windsor Detroit border,
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   we could just sort of air match.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.160]   It would be phenomenal.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.200]   Are you--
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:24.320]   Also with us, Andy and Ico from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:24.880]   Hi, Andy.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.920]   Do?
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.200]   You seem a little subdued today.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.760]   You're a little--
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.240]   Are you--
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:28.640]   Are you--
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.040]   Okay.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   Oh.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.440]   I'm a little under the weather.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.800]   Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.920]   We're sending good thoughts, Andy.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.960]   Sending chicken soup.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.400]   That would be more useful.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.240]   Chicken soup for your soul.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.800]   And Alex Lindsey in studio.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.840]   Thank you for coming up here.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:41.920]   My pleasure.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.400]   Please come up.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.040]   It's more often.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:43.520]   It's nice.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.560]   It's so nice to see you.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.520]   It's going to be in here.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.320]   Our show today brought to you by WordPress.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.800]   WordPress, of course, hosts my blog.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.320]   I used to run my own hosted--
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.920]   self-hosted WordPress,
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.200]   which everybody still can do.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.640]   But I spent a lot of time messing with it,
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.160]   which was why I had it.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.960]   And eventually I thought,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.960]   you know, I'm probably better to spend that time blogging.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.280]   So I went to WordPress.com.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.160]   WordPress.com, who does the hosting,
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.080]   they do the security updates,
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.040]   the patching,
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.960]   and they give me a great-looking blog.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.280]   WordPress is the best-known platform for websites.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.720]   I'll tell you how well-known.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.800]   28% of all websites run on WordPress.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.520]   28%.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.000]   They power the entire internet, practically.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.320]   Why?
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.640]   Because it's a solid code base.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.160]   It works really well, has universal support.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.840]   Almost every blogging tool,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.640]   right out of the box,
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.240]   it's going to work with WordPress.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.200]   So you have not just the great WordPress content management
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.880]   system that you can enter content into.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.160]   And that's actually usually what I use,
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.360]   just the web-based version.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.280]   But they're third-party programs,
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.800]   like our friend Daniel Jalkut's Red Sweater blog,
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   his Mars edit.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.520]   Fantastic.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.840]   Works beautifully with WordPress.com.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.680]   Look, whether you're a blogger or you're a business,
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.360]   and we always talk about my blog,
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.920]   but frankly, it's more important for small businesses.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.600]   You've got to have a website.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.480]   And where should you start at WordPress.com?
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.400]   Make it easier for your customers to find you,
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.040]   connect with you,
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.880]   hear how you can help them.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.800]   Every single business used to be,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.200]   you had to have a yellow page's entry now.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.040]   Forget the yellow pages.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.120]   You need an online home,
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.640]   a WordPress.com website.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.400]   By the way, it's easy.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.600]   I know your business is not designing websites.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.040]   So you don't want to become a webmaster,
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.560]   but you don't need to.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.960]   You can use WordPress very easily.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.200]   If you go to WordPress.com and click the Get Started button,
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.760]   and pick a template and start entering contents,
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.560]   that's simple.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.320]   But you can also, if you want,
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.560]   there are so many great developers.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.360]   There's such great third-party support for WordPress.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.640]   And of course, a great community of people at WordPress.com
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.600]   who will help you,
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.600]   not to mention WordPress's own fantastic support team.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.960]   I've used them, and they're really good.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.000]   Boost your visibility.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.080]   Every single WordPress.com site
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   has search engine optimization,
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.600]   social sharing, I use that.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.960]   I mean, that's really important.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.800]   Not to mention the fact that you can say,
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.120]   "Follow me on your WordPress site."
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.720]   Because there's such a big community of WordPress.com,
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.960]   almost instantly, half a million people started following me.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.480]   It was mind-blowing.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.120]   28% of all websites run on WordPress find out why.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.560]   Some of the best, biggest publications on the internet,
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.600]   like courts.com,
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.480]   run on WordPress.

[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.640]   for giving me such a great platform.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.880]   Everybody's such a great platform for so many years.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.120]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   LeoLoport.com, if you want to see my WordPress blog.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.960]   Mark Gurman.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.720]   Now at Bloomberg.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.440]   Boy, that wasn't that a good acquisition for Bloomberg.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.800]   Wow.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.480]   I've heard of him.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.360]   I've heard of him.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.680]   He, of course, became famous at 9-5 Mac.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.840]   We quote him all the time.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.800]   Probably because he's a very sweet humble guy.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.880]   I saw him at Google I/O this year.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.520]   I met him for the first time and I was really impressed by him.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.040]   But one of the reasons I think people
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.760]   like him and talk to him,
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.920]   because he is such a nice guy and he gets the best scoops out of Apple.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.120]   He's got great sources.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:38.320]   His story earlier this week, Apple plans to release a cellular capable watch
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.720]   to break iPhone times.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.200]   Intel said to supply the modem.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.400]   It works with cell networks.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:50.560]   Apple, according to Gurman, plans to sell this new Apple Watch Series 3 this year.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.920]   Now I do want to find a little fault with Mark.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   It's not probably his fault.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.600]   But he, in his interview on Bloomberg and his article,
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.840]   kind of implied that this is a breakthrough.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.920]   It's a breakthrough for Apple, but I have to point out others who've done this a lot.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.480]   Samsung and I have an LG Android Wear watch that has its built in,
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.760]   has its own SIM card and it allows you to make phone calls as well as access to data.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:21.040]   I get the impression from reading Mark's story that this is not for making phone calls.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.880]   This is really about LTE data.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.520]   So you can get maps, you can stream music.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.720]   It's a very delicate, but like they've had, as far as I know, like you never know about,
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.040]   but they've had, they've been working on LTE Apple watches since the before the first Apple
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:35.760]   watch came out.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.000]   And it's always been a question of battery efficiency and thermal, like the original iPad,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.880]   the original Apple Watch ran at the thermal limits of that design.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.960]   You just could not make that device hotter.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.920]   And subsequently they, you know, they made it, they added more battery because they have a list
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.800]   of things that they consider to be important to people that they want to solve for.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.720]   And they added GPS and they added more battery life so people could do the workout and not run
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.080]   out by the end of the day.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.160]   And sort of cellular is on that list.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.080]   So I don't know if it will ship this year.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:08.320]   It depends on whether it provides enough battery life to be, sorry, if it just came out,
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.960]   suddenly it was half a day battery life that'd be a non-starter phone.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.640]   So provided they could provide a sufficient battery life, that watch will ship when they
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.680]   hit that point.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.960]   It's not just battery life because the phone watches I have from Samsung and LG are massive.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.320]   Well, theirs is not.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:22.880]   See, that's the thing.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.840]   I think the original model, the quote was it would burn your wrist off.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.160]   Right.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.840]   You don't want that.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.720]   Also, I think that's part of the future of Apple Watch.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:38.640]   I started, I liked the special June Pride Watch band so much that I, that's what finally
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.840]   got the Apple Watch out of the drawer for the first time in months because I just thought it was
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.480]   a very, very pretty band. And it got me, even though I'm not primarily an iPhone user,
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.920]   realizing how good a fitness watch it is and how good a media watch it is,
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.840]   even if you're just using it with an Android phone.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.480]   And that's all you're getting from it.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.640]   So it'd be nice to have a cellular on it, particularly if it's being used primarily as a data
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.040]   connection as opposed to a voice connection.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.360]   But if it means that I now have to get another account and another service, if it means that I
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.480]   have to get a new data plan for my existing service, that wouldn't be a really great move
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.880]   forward, at least not for me. What I think that Apple should really do is move forward just on the
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:24.880]   basic idea of making this a generic device that will happily talk to any help, any phone that,
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.600]   excuse me, we're obviously talking about, that will happily talk to Android as well as iPhone
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:38.000]   to take it away from its first generation idea of you're going to have a watch that can work as
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.120]   sort of a terminal for apps that are running on a phone, have everything running directly on the
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:49.360]   phone, have it just run, have it just connect intermittently to a host phone if it's present,
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.480]   just for sinking purposes and for status purposes, but allow people to simply just put this on,
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.400]   play whatever music they want, get access to fitness information off of any, off of any app that they
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:06.240]   want. That's, as I think that really needs to go in the same direction as the iPod did, where it was
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:13.760]   originally a Mac only product. And then once you realize that they're only about 10% or fewer of
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:20.160]   desktops around the world are Macs. And the 90% of the people have money to spend on watches,
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:25.600]   perhaps you should sell to people who have Android phones as well as iPhones as well.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.160]   And if you really want to get to the potential of the product.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:33.040]   - Gurman says that the phone would probably be sold as, or the watch rather, the phone watch,
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.560]   I guess I should call it, would be sold by carriers in carrier stores. That's how they do the other
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:45.280]   ones. AT&T Verizon Sprint and T-Mobile. The new device could still be delayed beyond 2017.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:51.360]   Indeed, the company, this is Gurman talking, had already postponed a cellular capable smartwatch
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:57.680]   last year. - And I think that there is an opportunity for, while maybe a lot of data,
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.120]   being able to walk out with your AirPods and your watch.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.160]   - But you can do that now, you just can't get streaming music. You wouldn't have to.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.480]   - You wouldn't have to answer the phone though.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.360]   - Well, that's, and again, he never mentions using it as a phone here.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.360]   - Right. I'm just saying that that would be convenient.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:18.480]   - But yeah, I mean, these are things that you can easily add. I can give me $80. I can go on eBay
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.800]   or Amazon and buy a really horrible Chinese watch that can do those things that will,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.120]   like that can just be a music player that will also, but no, no, no, I'm saying,
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.720]   basically, it has a feature, but it is all with you.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.920]   - The power is always the ecosystem. I mean, that's why you don't want to know something else.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.840]   - He's agreeing with you. Alex, he's agreeing with you.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.760]   - No, I'm about to finish the sentence.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.560]   - Okay.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:45.760]   - Saying that if all it did was it can act as a Bluetooth device that can pair to any phone.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.800]   And when a phone call comes in, here's the phone number, here's the call ID information,
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:55.520]   touch this button, and it will act as a hands-free device for answering that phone call.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:00.880]   That would make it so much of a nicer... It's not something that would require Apple-only software
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.680]   to run on an Android device, for instance. I'm saying that it would be nice if I could be able to...
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:11.920]   One of the things that got me so... That rekindled my interest in the Apple Watch
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.680]   was also having AirPods and being able to sync a couple, excuse me,
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:21.440]   sync at least one playlist to the thing, and now rely on that as my music player,
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.800]   given that I don't need to have 128 gigs of albums with me all the time,
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.640]   I just want to have a couple of important playlists and maybe a few recent podcasts.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:35.680]   So it really did make me reconsider how much money Apple might be leaving on the table,
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.040]   and how much of the potential of this device that Apple is leaving behind
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.440]   by requiring that there has to be an iPhone somewhere in the mix.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:50.400]   I can make it work because I do have iPhones, I still am an iPhone user intermittently,
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:56.880]   so when it comes time to copy music onto the device, I can bring up the phone that's paired with
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.600]   and do that. When it comes to updates and stuff like that, I can again produce an iPhone to make
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:07.600]   that happen. It's just very, very clear to me that these seem to be arbitrary decisions for the
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.840]   basic operations of the phone, and given how well it works for... How well the fitness apps built
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:20.160]   into this Watch work, the ability to have all the benefits, the health benefits of the Apple Watch,
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.280]   but also make them available to people who have not bought iPhones would be another step in the
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.800]   direction of Apple really underscoring their idea that we're making products to make
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:34.080]   people's lives better as opposed to maintain a 41% markup whenever we possibly can.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:40.800]   I think that for me, I mean, part of my problem is I have a couple different phones, and the thing
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.440]   is if I use them at my two different... One iPhone is for when I'm overseas and one iPhone is when
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:52.320]   I'm local, the overseas one's team. Do you want to pay for another subscription for your watch?
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.240]   No, what I'm saying is that the problem right now for me is the one... I can only think it's a big
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:00.640]   deal to switch phones on my watch. I have to sit there. They said, "Oh, well, more than one."
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.360]   But this, you wouldn't even need your phone. The idea is the watch does everything the phone does.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.680]   Right, and I guess... And I guess... And I get to work with an Android phone.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.720]   What I'd love to be able to do is be able to walk out of the house without my phone, and
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.400]   other people can still call me, and I can still call them. And if I just say call my wife, and it just
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.560]   calls, and that would be... There's a lot of problems. They're different problems that need to be
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.320]   solved. And I guess they line up what they think are the biggest problems. And one is, if you support
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.600]   Android, they've got to line up everything the way they did with iTunes on Windows. And it's not
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.800]   overly complicated, but it is something they have to create may change. Can you use Apple?
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.320]   Watch with the Android now? No, but sorry. But also, if they believe that it was last year or
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.120]   the year before that they were going to get the independent one out, then they're putting all
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.440]   their efforts towards getting an Apple Watch out that doesn't need an iPhone or an Android phone,
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.640]   and that might be where they're lying there would behind it. And then it slipped a year, it slipped
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.120]   two years. And the carrier thing is absolutely flummoxing too, because we're still... They deliver
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.080]   a pizza to your house, and they count the amount of people that are going to eat it and charge you
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.600]   more based on that, instead of just giving you a pizza and letting anybody want to eat it. And
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.920]   that's my analogy for here's your data, here's your plan. Whatever phones you want, whatever
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.560]   tablets you want, whatever watches you want, that just all comes from your bucket in joy.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.720]   And that's not that kind of stuff. Not Apple. The Apple Watch. The cellular networks.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.080]   Like the cellular networks, it shouldn't matter to them how many devices I have, as long as I'm
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.360]   paying for the amount of data that I'm going to sell. Oh, I see charts in terms of an extra
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:21.040]   subscription. Google Fi works like that. You could buy or rather get a free data sim from Google Fi,
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.600]   and it's all just part of your account, put it in your iPad, and use Google Fi's service.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.720]   And a lot of places have family plans. I could definitely imagine someone like T-Mobile saying,
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.080]   you know, you can use your watch, your new watch all t-shirts, just like 10 bucks extra per month
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.360]   per device or something. Right. And it's just data. You know, it's... And it's all free.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.480]   Oh, now remember, we're talking about the carriers. Seems highly unlikely.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   But T-Mobile will be the one that would be the most likely to do that.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.320]   Yeah. Because they tend to be the most aggressive about, we're just going to make it easy for you
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.000]   to use it. And if they also... Also, over a leg up, they would. Over the weekend,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.520]   Gruber said that he heard there's a new watch coming this year, a new design.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:48:00.880]   Oh, really? Yeah. That was one of the things he dropped. So that kind of confirms this idea.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:06.800]   And a series three watch with new... We know new software, right? iOS 11 will come to the watch.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.880]   I pull a watch OS 4.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.240]   A watch OS 4.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.480]   Okay. All right.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:17.520]   Yeah. The one last comment that I forgot to make though, that the other cool thing about
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.800]   when you're not using it, when using it as a watch, not necessarily connected to a phone,
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.480]   whether it's an iPhone or an Android device, oh my God, the battery life on this thing.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:30.080]   When it's not checking in with the phone, you get days of battery life. It becomes a fit bit.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:34.480]   And that's another reason why I'm thinking, oh goodness, the sooner that Apple banks this,
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.600]   I stand alone device, kind of like an iPod, where so long as you occasionally bring it to a computer
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:46.160]   to refresh data or update apps, the better. It's so much, again, I keep coming back to the
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.400]   word potential. It really made me think there's so much potential in this device that isn't being
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:54.720]   tapped. If it's smart about how it uses the LTE, because of course, the iPhone, if it loses signal
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.880]   to its cell towers, it's one of the fastest ways to burn your battery.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.920]   So this would be the opposite, which is why I think they're being very conservative.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.600]   But the functionality they enable is that LTE still does race to sleep very well. So if it can
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.840]   sip data and shut down really fast, it prolongs battery life, where if it's doing phone calls or
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.520]   streaming Apple music, it's got to keep that connection on. And that's when you start creating
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.800]   the heat and the battery drain. I'm even talking about without LTE. I'm talking about a first,
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:25.760]   second, third generation watch that just has Wi-Fi as intended to be, not something that keeps in
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:31.840]   communication with a style of usage, not a new piece of software, a new piece of hardware,
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.520]   but a style of usage that says, "We're going to support you if you decide that you don't care
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:40.320]   about connectivity to a phone." And it becomes a really interesting device after that, I think.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:44.480]   Because of the idiosyncrasies of syncing the phone, I had this thing, I switched phones,
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:50.240]   and then I killed a phone, and then my watch was connected to the phone that I had wiped out.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.200]   And now it doesn't--
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.120]   That's problematic, by the way, with the Apple watch.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:53.520]   They don't--
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.480]   It is.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.280]   That's hard. You have to--
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.080]   I haven't done it yet.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:56.480]   So I've been--
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.280]   There's a lot of money--
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.120]   I've been like a month with it, I cannot connect to anything. It's just a watch.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:49:59.680]   You know, and it does--
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.520]   That's a utility of stealing it.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.520]   So you get that from Apple?
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.480]   Well, no, so there's-- I thought he meant the health data, because the health data is one of the
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.920]   few things that still doesn't sync, and you can use the utility to copy that off and copy it to
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.040]   another watch or another phone.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:11.680]   I don't care about the data.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.320]   What he wants to do is pair his watch to a different phone.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.200]   But you have to go back to one phone and release it, and then send it to people where--
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:17.600]   It must be--
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.720]   You can un pair it.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.920]   Yeah, you can un pair it on the watch. You can tell to the race--
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.560]   I just--
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.160]   It's just one of those things I haven't gotten around to.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.600]   Oh, but you have to-- but that's the key. You have to erase the watch to have that to do.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.000]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.720]   I've switched the watch so many times that losing the data is some reason.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.160]   Right. I've done it several times.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.200]   I'm just looking at it.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.000]   I know this is--
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.600]   I know this is a tangent, but I was out with my phone today, and I got this text from Rogers that
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.720]   said, "You have used all your data for the month."
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.920]   And then I got-- and I ignored it because I was on the road, and then I got another one
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.960]   an hour later that said, "You have now accrued $90 worth of money for me."
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.520]   Oh!
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.320]   We're going to shut down your data connection unless you press this button.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.000]   So I pressed the button, and then I called them.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.960]   They said, "Oh, yeah, our overage is $70 a gigabyte."
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.440]   Whoa!
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:06.080]   And so I tweeted it, and this lawyer tweeted back, going, "Yeah, actually, the Canadian government
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.320]   caps it at 50, but when you press that button, you're agreeing to override that cap to 70."
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.080]   And I'm like, "I don't have a choice. It's no data," or I override the cap.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.880]   There's no-- so I mean, that's-- cellular companies are still not--
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.680]   It used to be that way.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.360]   I think that Verizon and a lot of them are now like $10 a gig over it.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.120]   And we still-- yeah.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.040]   $70 a gig was--
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.520]   I'm going to tell you, it's just as bad in Canada.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.040]   Roger is just as bad as any of our cell companies in the world.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.760]   No, they haven't known what they--
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.280]   Cauchyu at any possible opportunity.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.160]   I thought he said seven.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.800]   I asked him three times to repeat the word 70.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.400]   70, wow.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   70, a gig, domestic, not even roaming.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.080]   I like Google fights.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.120]   $10 a gig, period.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.320]   I just want you to--
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.600]   Whatever you want.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:50.560]   Use as much as you want.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.120]   I got another sim from my iPad Mini.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.080]   Put it-- because that's one of the few LTE iPads I have put it in.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:56.960]   Works.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.000]   It thinks it's on T-Mobile.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.680]   It's great.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.160]   That's great.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.640]   Oh, by the time I called them, it had gone up to $140.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.960]   Like, I got the first message, then the second message was $90.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.320]   I called them was $140.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.120]   Well, the worst part is that a lot of time,
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.960]   with Facebook, sometimes uploading images in the background,
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.320]   or with that Wi-Fi assist--
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.280]   Instagram, Snapchat, and--
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.480]   I had one month--
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.600]   That was like-- I was like--
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.600]   I was getting slowed down because I still have, of course,
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.400]   the old AT&T.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.160]   And I was getting slowed down.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.760]   I was like, how much have I actually used?
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.320]   I looked at my phone.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.600]   It was like 240 gigs.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:26.400]   You know, it was just like--
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.520]   I wanted to do brains.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.200]   Pre-scising all that video, right?
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.480]   It's pre-scishing video.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.840]   My new Lenovo laptop, because I stopped buying Apple laptops.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:39.200]   My new Lenovo laptop supports LTE.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.360]   I didn't get the radio, so I have to open it up.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.960]   You can buy the radio and plug it in.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.240]   It just looks in.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.440]   And then I could use a Google--
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.160]   The reason I didn't do it is because I don't want another full subscription,
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.080]   but once I found out I could just have Google Fi get a free sim,
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.520]   put it in there, and it's on my existing account.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.800]   So that's a good solution.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.760]   And if the carriers do that, I wonder if they will,
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.520]   but if the carriers do that, then I wouldn't mind having a watch with LTE,
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.520]   as long as it's part of my existing subscription.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.320]   I'd buy more data.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.200]   They'd make more money off of it.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.040]   They'd make more money, wouldn't they, in the long run?
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.560]   And by the way, LTE ultimately is going to carry voice.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.720]   That's going to be the only way voice works, probably,
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.160]   is in LTE in the next year or two.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.920]   I think all my stuff is voice over LTE.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.840]   So you're still using probably whatever the other CDMA or GSM
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:28.000]   on a lot of calls, but ultimately it'll all be LTE.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.360]   Yeah, because it used to drop to HSPA when you would do a voice call,
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.720]   because LTE couldn't transit it.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.080]   And I haven't seen that anymore now.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.200]   That's the CDMA phone.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.720]   That was one of the issues with CDMA.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.160]   Well, no, even GSM.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.480]   CDMA wouldn't let you do voice and data over EVDO.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.280]   But even LTE wouldn't let you do voice and data at the same time.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:47.120]   So you would drop to HSPA on a GSM network in order to do the voice.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.040]   And now with voice over LTE, Volte, yeah, that's gone too.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:51.680]   It's terrific.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:57.520]   So I would hope that even if the Apple Watch series 3 isn't voice initially,
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.360]   that it would ultimately support fault.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.280]   Or like FaceTime and Skype.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.120]   And there's so many just bits and bits and bits.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.200]   Then you really have a Dick Tracy one.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.160]   Well, FaceTime audio.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.560]   I mean, no, I want video.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.120]   You don't have to say I have Nest cameras
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.840]   watching my driveway.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.440]   And if somebody's moving in my driveway,
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.440]   I get a picture of them on my Apple Watch.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.440]   That is pretty freaking awesome.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.000]   It's amazing.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.920]   And some of the don't know some of the doorbells do that too.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.600]   Yeah, the Ring Doorbell will do that too.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.280]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.960]   All right.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.000]   All right.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.640]   One question.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.080]   Paul, we'll pull the chat room and I'll pull you guys too.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.400]   If you had a choice between an Apple Watch
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.560]   that used its battery to keep the face on all the time,
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:44.240]   or an Apple Watch that used its battery to put an LTE chip in there,
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.000]   which would you choose all the time?
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:46.640]   All the time.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.200]   All the time.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:47.920]   All the time.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.880]   All the time.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.840]   Oh my gosh.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.560]   All the time?
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.040]   Apple?
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:51.760]   All the time?
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.080]   You get it.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:52.800]   The thing where you watch this.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.240]   It currently doesn't work as a watch.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.200]   You see, everybody go like this.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:56.640]   It's like this.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.400]   And then you have to do the wrist snap because it's just.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.200]   But if you do too much, you're going to snap.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.320]   Like an animal.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.120]   Like an animal.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.640]   We're not animals.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.520]   Look at the chipper.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.000]   It's just that.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.640]   LTE.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.120]   All that.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:07.520]   We got it.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.080]   Go ahead.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:08.080]   Go ahead.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:08.560]   Go ahead.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.160]   No, I'll just say it's not just that.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.040]   But us old timers born before 2000.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.440]   Like there was only one time we were ever programmed to check our watch like this.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:22.400]   And that's when like we are at a restaurant and the host has said,
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.800]   oh, I'm sure we'll have a table for you in the next five minutes.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.000]   And that was 20 minutes ago.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.520]   And you really want to be rude to say, hi.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.600]   Yes, see, I'm really looking at my watch now.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:35.200]   As opposed to I'm having lunch with somebody that I'm enjoying having that time with.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:40.240]   And I just need to make sure that I know that I have a train that I have to catch in about 45 minutes.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.840]   So I don't want to send a message that if I'm doing it, I want to explicitly say,
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:48.480]   hi, I'm sorry, I need to check the time and my watch does not work unless I do the rude time check gesture.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:57.760]   So we have one vote for one vote for LTE and then all the rest for full time all the time watch face.
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.280]   And then one vote for everything.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:55:59.920]   I want it all.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.240]   I want it all and longer battery life.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.000]   Double the battery life and give me all teachers.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:04.800]   That's really happening.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:05.520]   Challenge right now.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:09.040]   They've got to come up with a new because I have to say that two watches I have that have LTE
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.440]   and are too big and ugly to wear.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:13.600]   The original one was a size of the original iPhone.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.560]   The original Samsung.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.480]   The Samsung look like you had a little phone on your.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   When I have the new Android, where one from LG is still too big and clunky.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.480]   And that's because they had to put all that extra battery in there.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.360]   It's probably also the radio takes up a little more room too.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:33.280]   So yeah, but that's yeah, that's why I would love to see is both if it moved in both directions,
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.280]   both make it way, way, way, way more connected with an LTE model.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:41.680]   But also explicitly we're going to knock another $20, $30 off the price
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.880]   and make it really, really easy to use it just as a watch.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.560]   Totally separated from what it rolls you doing.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.680]   Well, so long as we're doing that, why don't we put time travel in there as well.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.400]   We got the knob.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:51.840]   I'm there.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.240]   I mean, literal time travel, not just on the wall.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.600]   Like in Doctor Strange, like in Doctor Strange returns his hands and time goes backwards.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.640]   Oh, I love that.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:58.960]   That's it.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.680]   That was awesome.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.240]   That's, you know, forget flying or invisibility.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.200]   That's my power.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.880]   That's my secret.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.720]   We didn't mention that services are now the number two revenue generator at
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.960]   our, it's iPhone services and all the rest.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.720]   If you can't make, if you can't get more customers, you get more money from the customers you have.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:24.400]   That's a real, somebody wrote an article I thought was quite good that really
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.520]   imperceptibly so, so, so, so lonely.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.880]   We didn't really notice it.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.040]   Apple's gone from being a hardware company.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:36.560]   To being a, you know, a services software and hardware company.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.160]   I'm like a whole different company.
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.880]   And that is a whole different mindset.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.640]   It's a whole different way of making money.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.920]   How does that change Apple?
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:49.520]   And Andy took the first breath.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:53.680]   I was going to, I was going to say that my first reaction to this is,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:59.200]   this is kind of like saying that we make, we make $32 billion off of our sales of Coke,
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.400]   Diet Coke and Moxie.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.080]   It's like, okay, I'm guessing you're making most of it.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:08.400]   The App Store, I was, I had a, I had a double check it, but like we were estimating last
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:13.840]   based on Tim Cook's keynote explanation of here's how much money we've handed out to developers
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.800]   in the past year that was causing us to speculate that,
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:23.760]   Apple revenue from the Apple from the App Store was about $28 billion in and of itself
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.560]   last year.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:29.520]   That doesn't really indicate how much money they're making off of music, how much money they're
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.800]   making off of storage.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.920]   These aren't areas in which Apple dominates.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.680]   They have a really good presence and really good products, but I really wish they would
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.720]   break that sort of thing down.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:46.800]   It's also, but I think that if Apple has one big problem that they hate and would love to solve,
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:52.320]   it's never, it's that of never being able to make a manufacturer enough products to sell for
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.160]   all the people who want to buy them.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.880]   And for them to get back into services allows them to cut out the entire process of manufacture,
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:04.160]   it allows them to express their design philosophy and remember they are a design company as much as
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.600]   they are an engineering company.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.720]   I don't mean that as an insult.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:11.840]   I'm just observing that of the things that drive this company, really great design or design that
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.480]   really appeals to Apple is one of those things.
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:19.600]   And yeah, I mean, there, I think that there is aware as anybody else of the question,
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:25.360]   what happens when all of a sudden nobody wants to buy Blackberries anymore?
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:30.400]   Nobody wants to buy phones with keyboards attached to them anymore, even though we were making so
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:37.200]   much money that we were, we didn't have enough denominations of money to burn, to start the fire
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.360]   of the pile of money we were burning at the party because we have so much money that we have to get
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.000]   rid of some of it.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:50.080]   What happens when maybe the iPhone becomes just another phone and they don't know exactly what
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:50.800]   to replace it with?
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.920]   And the answer is to make sure that they have making lots of money off of services.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:57.040]   They've seen how much money Google is making from services.
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.800]   They've seen how much money without, excuse me, even getting rid of ad sales.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.920]   They've seen how much money that Amazon of all people is making office services.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.160]   They've seen how much money that Microsoft is making.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:10.000]   I mean, they have these companies have really nice front-facing products, but
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.960]   the thing is they are, they make steam pipes and they make a huge amount of money off of steam pipes
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.000]   because every industry is running off a steam these days.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.320]   So if you really want an app, an app or a service, you're going to have to buy some capacity
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:29.120]   from one of these companies that sells eBooks, $50 tablets, sweaters at a discount, and also
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.240]   web app services.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:35.360]   So yeah, this is Apple trying to diversify itself, trying to make sure that it's got
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.960]   as many revenue streams as possible to try to future proof its success as much as possible.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.480]   And I think we're certainly going to see more of this.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.600]   It's also interesting to me because there was a big debate previously with
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.200]   our Apple as a software hardware company.
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.240]   And it started to strike me that it's not really even a, it's not either of those things.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.440]   It's not even really a product company.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.200]   It's a differentiated experiences company and increasingly you need
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.480]   services to provide that.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:00.320]   Like they figure out what they want to do and services is an increasing part of that.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.000]   And now the threats are coming from services.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.320]   Like if you look at WeChat in China, it's become such a big platform that it just abstracts away
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.280]   even the hardware software and other services underneath it.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.560]   And if you want to protect yourself and protect, like Andy said, your company,
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.840]   you have to start offering services that are as important to people.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.920]   Whatever people see first, that doesn't matter what the pipes are.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.160]   The interface is the application, the display is the hardware, all of those things.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.160]   You've got to give them something that keeps them on that platform.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:30.080]   Actually, somebody in the Sharon pointed out that although iPhone sales revenue went down in China,
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.680]   App Store sales went through the roof.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.720]   And that shows you where services can even out revenue,
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.120]   even in a place where you're not selling the hardware.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.560]   All those WeChat downloads.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.040]   I do think that they're all, as Renee was saying,
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.280]   I think the services are less about revenue to Apple and more about
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.480]   creating a powerful ecosystem that everyone stays tied into.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.720]   You know, that there is certainly works.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.280]   They're making a lot of money on it, but I think that the primary reason that they're doing the
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.880]   services is to make sure that you stay attached to this entire ecosystem.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.560]   Well, I think that's how it started.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.200]   But now it's become a focus.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.280]   So why not keep that?
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.240]   I think it's like a revenue capacitor where it really just evens out.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:14.880]   Exactly.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.000]   Earlier, we were talking earlier about how revenue from let's say hardware spikes on the release
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.880]   and spikes on a release and spikes on a release and spikes on a release.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.600]   And that's there's no problem with that.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.640]   So long as that's not the only way you're making money, when you're selling apps,
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.160]   you're selling apps to everybody who has ever bought an Apple device.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.200]   And they're not waiting for the next version of Lightroom.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.840]   We're not waiting for the next version of their HP 65 calculator app to come out.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.080]   They're always there's a steady flow of revenue coming in from at least this source.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.200]   And if that source is in the tens of billions of dollars, that's an umbrella for a rainy day.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.520]   Did we talk last week about Vic Gundotra's post on Facebook?
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.080]   I can't remember if you weren't here.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.280]   I don't know.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.160]   I don't think we did.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.720]   It came out last week exactly.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.800]   But let's talk about the guy who started Google+ posting on Facebook to say,
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.280]   you don't want an Android phone, just get an iPhone.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.640]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:15.600]   And that'll be a good segue into your article on iPhone photography and iOS 11.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.560]   But first, I want you Alex to smell that.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.520]   Oh, it smells good.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.160]   It's good.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:22.880]   It does.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.400]   How about this?
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.040]   Smell this.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.880]   Smell this.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.240]   And look at my hair while you're smelling it.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:30.800]   It's quite nice.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:34.160]   I would make you smell my hair, but you can smell that.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.960]   And that's what give you this is the this is the wanderer hydrating sage and black pepper
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.680]   sea for a man.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   You don't want to smell like perfume.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.160]   That's the right thing.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.920]   You want to smell like sage and black pepper.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.720]   This is the shampoo and this is the body cleanser.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.960]   And sulfate, I love this sulfate free.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:55.200]   No parabens, no synthetic dyes.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.360]   This is a new product from Dollar Shave Club, our sponsor.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.840]   But you use it even when you're not shaving your head.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.480]   Yeah, right.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.360]   No, this is right.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.800]   This is your body wash.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.920]   This is your shampoo.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.640]   What I like about Dollar Shave Club, they've kind of pioneered the idea of
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.800]   getting, subscribing to get your personal care products in the mail.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.880]   So you don't have to think about having a new razor blade.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.880]   I really, that was a revolution for me.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.040]   The idea that I always had a fresh razor blade.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.880]   I changed my razor blades on Monday.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.600]   And I always have, I always know I've got a fresh razor blade.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.200]   So I don't, I don't cut myself.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.680]   By the way, one of the things I love about Dollar Shave Club,
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.560]   I don't, I have to do some, I'm going to find somebody who tests this.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.360]   But it's my opinion.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.320]   They are the sharpest blades on the market today.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.600]   And you might say, I don't want a sharp blade, but you do want a sharp blade.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.360]   You're going to cut yourself less.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.920]   It's like having a good cooking knife versus a dull cooking knife.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.880]   You're going to cut yourself less.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.320]   You're going to get a closer shave.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.640]   And you're not going to get as much pulling if the blade is sharp.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.720]   And I think Dollar Shave Club's blades are the best.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.880]   They are absolutely sharpest.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.360]   Dollar Shave Club is the smarter choice, a great shave at a great price,
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:58.240]   conveniently delivered right to your door.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.080]   It's, this is a life hack, folks.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:04.160]   You don't have to schlep to the store to buy a, God, don't ever do this.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.280]   Get one of those blue handled cheap disposable razors.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.920]   But that is what you want to know what a bad shave is?
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.000]   Use one of those razors once.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.520]   No, I have my Dollar Shave Club executive razor.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.480]   I use the Dollar Shave Club shave butter from Dr. Carver.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.920]   Oh, that is the nicest stuff.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.800]   It's transparent, which is a weird feature, but you can actually see what you're shaving.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.520]   You're not shaving through this fog of war.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.720]   We call shave cream.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.440]   I love it.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.960]   And it gives you not only a better shave, but it prevents ingrown hairs.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.320]   It fights razor bumps and it smells and feels great.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.400]   Your skin is softer after you shave.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.360]   Make the smarter choice.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.480]   Join Dollar Shave Club.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.040]   We've got a great deal for you for a limited time.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:49.600]   If you're a new member, you can get this kit for a mere $5 plus free shipping.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:55.680]   The kit includes the executive handle, which is a very nice weighted handle with a grip,
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.800]   but it's made out of metal.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.320]   It's really solid.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.120]   You get four blades, four of the great Dollar Shave blades.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.920]   And by the way, these are, you know, everything you want in a cartridge,
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:08.480]   plus the blade in the back that gives you the little trimmer for the hard to reach places.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.280]   I really value that and the lubricating strip.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:19.680]   You get that and a full size tube of Dr. Carver's easy shave butter formula 6301-1.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.240]   By the way, that formula number has never changed.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.480]   I keep waiting for dash two, but they never upgraded.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.120]   They don't need to.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:25.520]   It's perfect.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.400]   What's something's perfect?
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.720]   And incidentally, every time you get it, I know again, they don't advertise this,
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.160]   but I love the bathroom minutes.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.400]   There's a little magazine in every box.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.720]   So every time you get your new box, it's got all this sort of fun little stuff in here.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.600]   It's really quite good.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:43.520]   It's kind of like the old farmer's almanac and in a pinch, you could use it for toilet paper.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:52.480]   That is the Dollar Shave Club executive razor plus shave butter plus blades, just $5.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.000]   Isn't that nice?
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.280]   And of course, after your first month, you get your replacement blades automatically.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.320]   This is everything you need for a month at the regular price.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.840]   No hidden fees, no commitments.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.240]   You can cancel easily anytime you like.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.120]   And you can only get this at our site, dollarshaveclub.com/macbreak.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.480]   Dollar Shave Club, please use that so they know you saw it here.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.360]   Dollarshaveclub.com/macbreak.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.760]   But while you're browsing around, take a look.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:22.320]   They have a bunch of other products, including those butt wipes, which I, well,
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.800]   let's not talk too much about that, but I do.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.320]   They have butt wipes?
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   And so you and I have Japanese toilets, which are awesome.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.080]   So we don't need these, but when you travel, don't you miss?
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:36.640]   Yes.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.560]   You miss the hydrating action.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.880]   You feel unclean?
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.720]   You know, the best thing to talk about.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.160]   There was NPR had the best thing.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.600]   They were talking about someone who deals with sewage systems all over the world to make sure.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.760]   And they asked her, they said, "We have to ask you, what do you use?"
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.080]   And she goes, "Oh, I have a Japanese toilet."
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.560]   He goes, "Because I don't dry my dishes with a paper towel."
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.440]   Exactly.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.440]   Exactly.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.440]   Plus, we're on septic.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:07:59.440]   Right.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.440]   And it's so much better for the septic.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:02.240]   Right.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.440]   Anyway, I can go on and on.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:09.440]   But when I travel, I really feel bad when I travel because I don't have the one wipe Charlie.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.440]   So I mean, I don't have the bidet, so I get the one wipe Charlie's.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.440]   And these are really great.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.440]   They have a lot of nice little products like that, the post shave cream and so forth.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:19.440]   But--
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.440]   Are they pepper-cented?
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:21.440]   No.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:24.440]   You know, that's a good question.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.440]   You want it?
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.440]   No, no.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.440]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   I'm not going to say it.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   You can't get it.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.440]   They also have boogie's hairstyling cream, which I-- or hair pomade, which I use.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.440]   The boogie's is quite nice.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.440]   It's kind of weirdly named.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.440]   The good shake hand cream.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.440]   So they're a lot-- they've gone way past the whole--
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.440]   This is interesting.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.440]   I love them.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.440]   They just say butt wipes.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   But what?
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440]   Hey, you know what?
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.440]   Dollar Shave Club, they don't mess around.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.440]   They're not going to--
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440]   Nambi Pambi.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.440]   This is it.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.440]   And it's what you--
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:58.440]   So I do highly recommend the Japanese toilet, but these are a lot less expensive.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.440]   And require no plumbing.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.440]   All right.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:03.440]   Let me put that away.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.440]   Thank you, Dollar Shave Club, Dollar Shave Club.com/MacBreak.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.440]   Vic Kundotra, who started at Microsoft, he went to Google.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:19.440]   He lobbied for Google to get social and created Google+, then when Google+ flopped, he mysteriously
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.440]   disappeared.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.440]   He resurfaced actually at a great company, which I highly recommend called Cartia.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   What's Cartia?
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.440]   Oh, this is-- well, you don't need it yet, but as you get older, you're going to need it.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.440]   Jeff Jarvis uses this.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.440]   If you've ever had-- it's from a live core as the company.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:41.440]   If you've ever had a fib, this is in your pocket, EKG, that works with your phone.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   I just want to get it for phone.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   It's FDA approved.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440]   It's 99 bucks.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.440]   It's cheap.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.440]   And yeah, I got it for fun because I don't have your fib.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   How am I doing now?
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.440]   But I got it for fun.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:55.440]   They will give you a diagnosis or you could send it to your doctor for a fee.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:00.440]   And it's FDA approved, which is one of the few-- one of these health devices that is FDA
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440]   approved.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.440]   It's an EKG you can carry in your pocket or attach it to the back of your phone.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.440]   Now you just have to be able to-- you just have to put it on your chest and go clear and
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440]   just push the two buttons.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440]   That was the next thing.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.440]   A defibrillator.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:20.440]   If you catch-- sometimes, AFib, you can't tell.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.440]   And of course, Jarvis, who's been hospitalized twice for it, he carries this all the time.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.440]   And his doctor says, "This is great."
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.440]   Anyway, that's Vic's new company.
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.440]   All praise to Vic Gondotra.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440]   However--
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440]   --a big jump from--
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.440]   --and--
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   --I think Alio was-- he's the one who also said that we can't have a world where one man
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.440]   and one phone dictates the fuel.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.440]   He had his whole screed against Steve Jobs.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.440]   Probably.
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.440]   I think that was--
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.440]   He was Google's interface on the Google Apps with Steve Jobs.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.440]   He likes to.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440]   As Steve passed, he wrote a very moving eulogy.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   He told some great stories.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.440]   About the color yellow, right?
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.440]   Yeah, right.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.440]   Yeah, right.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.440]   The color yellow.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.440]   Jobs called him.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.440]   He was at services on a Sunday and said-- and Vic didn't answer, but he later talked to him.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.440]   He said, "The color in the 'O' is wrong on the Google Apps."
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440]   It's the wrong color.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:03.440]   It's like-- but he's got a history of saying bombastic things in public.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.440]   But Vic is awesome.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.440]   And he does.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.440]   And this is a bombastic thing.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.440]   He posts not on Google+, but on Facebook.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.440]   First dig.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.440]   The end of DSLR for most people has already arrived.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.640]   I left my professional camera at home and took these shots at dinner with my iPhone 7 using
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.320]   computational photography, portrait mode, as Apple calls it, "Hard not to call these results
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.960]   in a restaurant on a mobile phone with no flash stunning."
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:27.960]   And I agree.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.960]   These are great pictures of his daughters.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.400]   And it says, "Great job, Apple."
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.840]   And later in a comment, he says, "No way should get an Android phone.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:34.840]   This is just the only way to go."
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:35.840]   This I might disagree with.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.840]   That's a bit kind of a love.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:37.840]   And just a little bit of a dick we know about.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.880]   You see the edge problem here with the back of the hair.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.360]   The hair suddenly goes out of focus, even though it's really in the same focal plane.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.440]   That's part of the problem with portrait.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440]   But you know what?
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.360]   No, but most people don't know that.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.240]   Emotionally it feels good.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.760]   Emotionally, that is a picture of your daughters you will love for the rest of your life, right?
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.160]   And that's an iPhone.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.840]   So I think a number of people disagreed with him about the DSLRs and disagreed with him
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.000]   about Android photography.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.800]   But his point really is, isn't it amazing what we can do now, thanks to, with small lenses
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.920]   and small sensors, thanks to computational photography and on that?
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.640]   I think that point is well taken.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.520]   And it sounds like Apple's going to be doing...
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.600]   One of the issues people had with him is that he was giving Apple all the credit for computational
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.520]   photography, where they believed that Google was a pioneer with Auto Awesome, which you
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.000]   came about because Google never really knew what hardware you had on a phone.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.320]   It's all they could do was sort of suck everything up and make it look as good as possible on
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.480]   their servers.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.840]   And now the rumor is Apple's going to be doing a version of Auto Awesome, but on device for
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.640]   people who just aren't comfortable with the service.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:45.800]   And once again, a huge advantage to Apple because it makes the hardware and the software.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.880]   It knows what you have.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.040]   It's built into the image signal processor on the phone.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.040]   Well, it was...
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:55.720]   I thought it was a really odd thing for him to be talking about, given that on device Google
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:02.160]   has had a system they call HDR Plus, which goes well beyond what simple HDR does.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.320]   I mean, as it happened just a week or two before that, I took one of my walks through
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.280]   Boston with a pocket full of phones because I had, I think, two new devices.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:14.760]   And as usual, I just take a walkthrough Boston with a bunch of phones and cameras that I
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.960]   know how they react and all these places that I usually take pictures at.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:23.240]   Taking the exact same pictures six times with six different cameras, including the latest
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:29.920]   Galaxy S8, the latest iPhone, my Panasonic LX10, which I really, really love, which is
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.720]   a real unquote camera.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:43.760]   And my two-year-old Android phone over here and a, what was I think a $300 Asus phone.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:46.600]   And just taking the exact same pictures time and time again.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.660]   There was a twist this time that I hadn't really counted on because all of them, I turned
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:56.840]   on a couple of different Google Photos auto upload features that in the meantime that I
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.200]   forgot I turned on, which meant that when I went to Google Photos, after being back home
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:06.960]   for about 10 minutes and things found Wi-Fi again, I suddenly had the, my camera roll
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.600]   was six copies of this exact same picture.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.560]   And I couldn't tell which camera had taken which one because you can't have to click
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.320]   the an info button to get that information.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.880]   So I said, you know what I'm going to do?
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:23.880]   I'm going to simply pick the one I like, create a brand new shared photo album called my Boston
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.720]   Walk or whatever, and I'm just going to simply without looking at the identity of these cameras,
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.840]   I'm going to just pick the best, the one I like, the best of all of them.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.320]   And I was expecting to see, there's some things I expected to see, but what I didn't expect
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.880]   to see is that overwhelmingly my favorite camera, the camera that took my favorite pictures
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.360]   was my two-year-old Nexus 6P made in 2015.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:52.240]   It was the only phone of the lot that had access to the stock Android camera app and
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.240]   HDR+.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:59.560]   So it was beating the iPhone 7, it was beating the brand new Galaxy S8, it was beating even
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.320]   again, this $600 camera that again, I love.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:08.480]   And so it really did reinforce for me that computational photography is the great influence,
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.960]   is really the one of the biggest things you can add to any phone that maybe the lens is
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.720]   not important, maybe the sensor is important, maybe even the onboard image processing isn't
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.720]   as important as just simply decide, recognize that, oh, that's a blue sky.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:24.840]   People like blue skies to be blue, I will make that sky blue.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.000]   So it's something to think about.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.720]   I should qualify though before ending this, that my rules for when I take these photo
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.040]   walks is that I don't get to interact with the camera at all.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:41.480]   I feel as though because different phones have different software features, the only
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.480]   fair way to do it is to keep it on completely automatic.
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.040]   So the phone has the option of doing HDR if it wants to do HDR.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.840]   All I can do is just simply hold it up and press the shutter button.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.240]   So obviously the difference between, so I would disagree with the idea that means that
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.920]   this camera is not as good as the camera in my phone.
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.440]   The difference is that if I want to actually be a camera by the way, as the cameras that
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.040]   Andy's recommended before the Panasonic Lumix LX10.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.640]   Yeah, it's a little pocket camera that I bought it when I was so, I was so impressed with
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.040]   the iPhone 7 last year and so impressed with the Google Pixel phone that I thought maybe
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:24.480]   I should buy an iPhone 7 just as a pocket camera and then I said, "You idiot, iPhone
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.960]   7 will cost you $700."
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.800]   You can buy a real camera with this actual optical zoom lens and a flash for that.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.960]   But the point is that I think that the next real revolution is not going to be about,
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.160]   "Hey, look how big the sensor is," or, "Hey, look at this wonderful exploded diagram of
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.320]   how intricate our lens system is."
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.520]   It's going to be, "Here is how much processing that we will do that's based not just simply
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.440]   on high exposure, low exposure, average them out, but at understanding that this is a picture
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.760]   of a statue.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.840]   The statue is made out of bronze.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:58.240]   Bronze has really, really deep shadow, hot, dark parts that have to be elevated out."
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.480]   So that's, I just thought it was really weird that Kindotra was making that point given
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.680]   that Android is probably the best-
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.680]   Exactly.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:06.680]   It was a great update about Google.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:10.360]   I think he would have, he knows perfectly well that-
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.160]   There was a great comment on Google.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.160]   Go ahead.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.920]   I don't remember who said it, but there was a great comment that said that previously
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.760]   it was all the algorithm guys that ruled this industry and they would work on the pixels.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.280]   It's like, separate the colors and find the edges.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:25.760]   And now it's all the machine learning guys who have taken over this product at all the
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.400]   companies and they're trying to say, "This is not brown.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.400]   This is a mountain.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400]   This is not blue.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.400]   This is a sky.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.400]   It's not white.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.400]   It's clouds."
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.480]   And this is what we know about these things and they should look, this is the idealized
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.640]   way they should look.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.160]   And they're doing exactly what Andy said.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:41.720]   And I think the shift now is towards computational systems that can also ingest a lot of data,
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.440]   like why you're getting two lenses or why you're maybe going to start getting those
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.760]   3D sensors or laser arrays inside the cameras, so they can ingest as much information about
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:54.560]   the world as possible to make better choices and then sort of recreate a reality inside
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.640]   the picture that's as good as it possibly can be.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:02.000]   And credit to Mark LeVoy, who is at Google Research and is their head of computational
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   photography.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.400]   And he started doing this with a jump camera, their VR camera, the Google Glass.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:13.320]   He had some very challenging physical limitations and they got better and better and better
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:19.560]   at handling it computationally to take kind of an imperfect optical shot and make it a
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.560]   much better shot.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.560]   So you're right, Andy.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.360]   It seemed detection instead of just face detection.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.360]   Exactly.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.360]   Just as Andy was talking about.
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.800]   As a matter of fact, just to think, it might have been just a couple of days before this
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:36.960]   came out, there was a new research paper that Google Research, working with MIT, was talking
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:43.200]   about an AI algorithm they had done where they teach the AI by saying, here are 5,000
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.040]   pictures and here are 5,000 versions of that picture that have been edited by real human
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.120]   beings.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:51.640]   And so that gives them that experience that a real human being, if they were fixing this,
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.040]   would sharpen this a little bit, but not a whole lot.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:59.280]   They would increase the brightness, but not so much that there's a halo around the sun.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:03.960]   And the idea of, and on top of all that, it's not just a post-processing thing.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.200]   The algorithm is built so that if it's on sufficiently good hardware, it'll actually
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.960]   just, this is the preview image you will get.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.000]   You will get the optimized image in preview.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.480]   So that's really is where things are going.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.600]   Not just the mathematics that says that you can mathematically and procedurally look
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.600]   at the histogram.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.440]   Like here is the chart of where all the light values are and realize that, okay, there's
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.240]   almost no black tones, there's almost no white tones.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.040]   So let's make sure that there's a little bit more of a spread there.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.600]   We're talking about, no, this is how a human, this is how a human being would want this
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.600]   to look like.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.440]   So that's why, and I should put Apple.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.240]   This is not unique to Google and Apple.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:41.380]   I mean, Sony and other companies are doing computational photography in their high-end
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:42.380]   cameras.
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.940]   Actually, that's where Nikon and Canon are being, I think a little bit left behind.
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.880]   This is the Sony A9 where it's both, it's hardware and software.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:53.600]   They're providing amazing new stacked, you know, full-frame chips, but then they're also
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.860]   backing it up with computational photography.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:00.120]   This is a picture, I took a lot of camera gear with me to Machu Picchu.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:05.480]   This is a picture I took at Machu Picchu with my Google Pixel and HDR+ turned on.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:10.280]   It's one of the best pictures I took and it was with a camera phone, not with my Canon
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.480]   5D Mark IV.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:19.760]   So I do think that there's a lot of merit in what Vic says, bottom-line computational
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.520]   photography is a future, but I'm not throwing away my DSLR.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:25.440]   It's happening there too.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:34.040]   And I think that especially for landscape shots, the difference between the DSLR and the phone
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.720]   drops dramatically.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.680]   Low light starts to show up.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.480]   There is a certain amount of physics.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.280]   So one of the things Canon has done is they have what's called an ME20 video camera.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.080]   And we have an ME200, which is kind of the smaller version of it.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.720]   It's just Canon's really making most progress in video now, isn't it?
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.320]   Yeah, they're doing a lot of interesting things with video.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.320]   We only use them as, so we're pretty much a black magic house at this point, except
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.680]   for these Canon cameras, which are extremely good at low light.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:02.320]   The ME20 will pretty much, you can shoot at night.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.760]   Is that a computational one or that's just a big shit?
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.760]   It's a mixture.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.840]   They did two things.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:12.800]   One is that they took a full-size sensor and ours is a Super 35 and they just said,
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.400]   okay, it's going to be 1920 by 1080.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.840]   So lots of area.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840]   It's like very few pixels.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.640]   It's giant micro, like giant sensors.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.480]   So each photosite is really big.
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:28.680]   And as a result, the ISO goes to like 4 million.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:35.520]   And we worked on a show where there was a lot of these ME20s being used at 2 AM in Africa.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.000]   And we're getting these live feeds and it just looks like the sun, but it looks like
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.240]   it's early morning or whatever.
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:43.240]   You can see all the color.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.240]   You can see everything there.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.200]   It was kind of amazing.
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:56.320]   And the ME20s are about 20 grand in the ME200 or 5 grand, but they're still, that is taking
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.320]   advantage of physics.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.840]   And then they added, of course, on top of that, a ton of computational computable about out.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:02.840]   It's not one of the other.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:07.240]   And admittedly, this is an order of magnitude and more expensive than an iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.240]   And probably isn't an order to bet.
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.240]   And it's not in your pocket all the time.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.240]   And it's not my pocket.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.240]   That's the big thing.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:19.640]   But so a series of photographers going to carry a pocket camera like Andy and a bigger camera.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.960]   And maybe even a camera phone.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:28.640]   And I think increasingly the kind of pro point and shoots that photographers bought are slowing
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.120]   down a little bit because a lot of times they don't need that.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.120]   You have to, right.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.520]   I think that I think there's between the people.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:40.960]   There were a lot of people who would buy like a $500 mic on SLR because there are types
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:45.040]   of shots that they wanted to take that would require that kind of a camera.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.440]   Not because they really wanted to be fancy, fancy photographers.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:48.440]   Right.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:52.280]   Now the people who need an SLR, that's few and far between.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:57.160]   I don't think, I think they're advantages to having a nice camera, but you can get,
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.760]   the promise, particularly of an iPhone, this is the one airing which I absolutely think
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:05.640]   that the iPhone is the best camera you can possibly get is because no other phone camera
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:10.160]   is as good at the idea of I'm going to aim this, I'm going to press this button and it's
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.400]   going to give me a picture that will never be less than good.
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:19.080]   But the, remember also remember that there's a factor of the software you've got on your
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:24.600]   phone itself or on your desktop where SnapSeed is just amazing.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.920]   It's a Google's free image processing app.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.400]   There are times where I am home and I'm in Photoshop and Lightroom trying to reproduce
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.560]   the results I got just by twiddling around in five or ten minutes with SnapSeed.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:43.160]   And then there's the idea, if there's a picture that I took in Harvard Square in 1993, 1994
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:48.160]   with one of my first digital cameras of a street performer who later on turned out,
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:52.680]   became a super, super famous performer and she wanted to use this picture that I'd taken
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:57.640]   like in a TED talk she was giving that went on to become a huge TED talk.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:03.080]   And I was, as the first, I've managed to find my original, my original two or three megapixel
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:10.680]   JPEG and by using modern apps, modern apps for HDR, modern apps for removing noise, I
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:17.240]   was amazed at what I could do just in 30 seconds, yeah, 30 seconds and even 30 minutes to take
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.760]   a picture that had a huge number of defects.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:24.720]   But then there's enough data inside there that a modern app could quickly tease out and
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.560]   figure out what the structure of this picture is and sort of into it where I was trying
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:32.240]   to go like what my intent was while I'm trying to improve it.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.640]   So don't the bottom line is don't worry too much about what kind of a camera you're using.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.120]   I think you're right.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.840]   As long as you got enough data, there's you can do something with it.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.200]   This is a red always say your original system folks who did the red camera and that's this
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:49.560]   crazy 1200 or I'm sorry, $1,500.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.200]   It's a hundred for the titanium.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:56.640]   I think hydrogen one phone, but it won't be out till next year.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.000]   Would anybody because of course they did.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.240]   Yeah, because of course, by that who would who would be crazy?
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.240]   No, you would buy it.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.240]   You know that.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.240]   You were on the list.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:06.240]   You were on the list and instantly.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.240]   In the first 10 seconds.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.240]   I was like, really?
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.520]   I was like, I don't even know what it does.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.680]   I'm buying it.
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.480]   If it's a phone and it's from red, I'm buying it.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.880]   Oh, Marcus Brownlee's reviewing it.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.800]   Yeah, he still I think wasn't allowed to show like none of us really know what it is.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:24.640]   Like it's like it does something great and we don't and red is one of the companies like
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.640]   Apple.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.160]   He wasn't allowed to show the holographic display right.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.160]   It's got a holographic display.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.520]   Oh, who cares about that, right?
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:34.000]   It's kind of well, I think it's kind of looks like a droid.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.240]   It's something you'd want though, right?
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.240]   It's kind of.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.240]   I still fit it in my pocket.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.240]   They didn't seem to be.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240]   I like the industry look at it.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.800]   Yeah, this will turn into a two handed phone for a lot of people and then the camera bump
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.800]   on the back.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.800]   Look at the size of that.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.040]   That's older than an indicator of what the module will actually look like on the inside,
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.520]   but it's still pretty big.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.520]   Definitely.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.520]   It's too early.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.680]   In other words, this is just yet yet they showed him two or three models.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.880]   One is just here is the design prototype one that was functional.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.840]   It looked nothing like the design prototype.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:03.400]   And then I think there was a mystery device that just that had the holographic stuff working
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.400]   on it.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.400]   But it's that's interesting.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:09.520]   It does point out that there are so many people for whom it really isn't a case of getting
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.520]   good pictures.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.240]   They are videographers.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.320]   They are journalists.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:18.440]   And this is the device that they carry into a situation because who wants to carry 80 pounds
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.440]   worth of stuff?
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.320]   Well, that buy something if for $500 you can get something that will give you the video
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:28.240]   that you need, give you the mobility you need, give you the high ability that you need.
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:30.840]   So do they take your money already?
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:36.240]   I had to give them some money.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:42.240]   It says $15.95 for the titanium and you could just get aluminum for $11.95.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.720]   But who would want that?
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.720]   Who would want that?
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.400]   Let's just see if they want money.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:51.400]   Order now.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.960]   I'm just glad to see if I had to put money down.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.520]   I think I just got on the list.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.560]   You could see a physical phone design that's at least interesting.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:02.240]   That's not a, hey, look, we're not for 2017.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.160]   The rounded rectangle, the radius is a little bit larger than it was the last time, but
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.800]   it's still a rounded rectangle.
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.800]   Okay.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.720]   I think I gave the credit card and I think that that means that, you know, I won't get
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720]   charged.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.920]   But as soon as I get charged, that'll be the time that I have to explain to my wife.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.720]   Yeah, you got a little past.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.120]   It came with this order for.
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.120]   Did you get another camera?
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.120]   No, of course not.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.520]   I didn't buy another camera.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.840]   Probably the thing is why make it a phone at all?
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.120]   Oh, because again, it gives you if it's data.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.640]   Yeah, I mean, you can get the data.
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.560]   You can replace something.
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.920]   You can now go out with only that and shoot it.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.920]   I think it makes a lot of sense.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.920]   You look at the bad video.
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:42.480]   It can hardly be overstated.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:46.480]   How this is a legitimate journalistic tool now.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.480]   Oh, I was too.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.480]   That's true.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.480]   We were in the ability.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.520]   It really is like remember that remember the Max Hadrum TV show?
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:58.320]   Like from the 1980s where Edison Carter has like this big Sony beta can that has this
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.600]   miraculous antenna that can actually broadcast from wherever he is.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.960]   And now we've actually got it.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.680]   There are people that I'm going to be.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.240]   It's not enough for me to record this video.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.840]   I have to make sure that this video leaves this device and goes someplace safe before
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.840]   people with clubs discover that I'm not simply a tourist.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.680]   I'm someone who's want to pull it.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.160]   We were in Switzerland at a big event and like half the journalists were just running
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.160]   around with iPhones.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.480]   You know, like that was, you know, that they were out there shooting their streaming
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.480]   to Facebook live.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.480]   I mean, shoot streaming to Facebook live and you throw it and especially you take one
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.680]   of those iPhones and you put it on to the Osmo mobile.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.200]   And you're sitting there running around and it's got a gimbal and so you're running around
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.600]   and doing these these interviews and we've built some pretty complex rigs for the for
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.600]   the iPhone.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.600]   So you get XLR in wireless.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.600]   You can go wireless to it.
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.600]   You got lights and you just nuts.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:49.080]   It's like, but it's like a Canon Emmy and an iPhone.
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.840]   And I've and here's the funny thing, my rig, my iPhone rig costs more than the Canon
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.680]   and it Emmy 200.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.160]   You know, so but it's, but it's like, you know, you can basically build all of this stuff
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.120]   into it with the right, you know, bits and pieces of it and.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.120]   I got the Osmo.
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:07.400]   Should I, should I use that to like one of the coolest things to do with the Osmo and
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.880]   I have kind of all of the Osmos.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.560]   So one of the cooler things to do with an Osmo is take it.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:16.280]   If you have a sunroof, just take it and hang it out the sunroof.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.080]   You have to kind of push up against it.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:22.080]   Now you can also now get, we've got these little suction cups for it.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:25.040]   But the, it just like you're floating through a town.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.520]   I shot in, I was in Cambodia and just stuck the stuck it out the top.
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.640]   And it was like floating through these little villages.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.480]   It's just amazing.
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:37.240]   But it's it's, now that's the, this is the, that's the little one I think.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.640]   That's the one I have the handheld one.
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.840]   Well, there's there's a, there's that one and there's one that's the, that's got the
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.800]   Zen moves five, I think on it.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.240]   It's a bigger version of that.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.080]   And then there's the iPhone one and then there, you know, there's, they've got a bunch of
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.080]   different versions.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.200]   Because there's one that's like the, the Osmo Pro, I think.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.200]   Oh yeah.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.360]   This one has a built in camera, but then I, I got the one that has the one that doesn't
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.920]   have a camera because you just put your iPhone on it.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:00.920]   Right.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:03.240]   The, I have, and that's the one I can't kind of throw in my bag.
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.120]   I mean, that's, I don't carry this one around that much.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.960]   I use that one for shooting other things.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:11.200]   So, and the other thing is, is that with the pro one, you can take that off and put it
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.520]   on the bottom of like an inspire, which is, so you get kind of this.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.520]   From the same company.
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.600]   It's the DJI Phantom company.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.560]   And I think we have, I think somehow we've accumulated most of what DJI makes.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.360]   So we kind of are on playing with it.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.360]   Shocked.
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.360]   I just, I was just playing.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.560]   I was flying the Mavic.
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.200]   I got, I have the Mavic.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:34.800]   Can you mount the robot arm on the drone and then fly the phone around?
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   This is the one.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   They're like, it's great.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.280]   Probably the only bummer about it is this.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:48.400]   You can't, you can't plug in the, the lightning goes, the lightning is on the wrong side.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.400]   You want to be able to have it.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.400]   And so the bummer about that is that you can't power it while you're using it.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.120]   Well power is one thing, but the other thing is we use, when we want to stream from an
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.920]   iPhone is we use, we hook it to ethernet.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:58.920]   So then we have super solid.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.920]   Can I put it in upside down?
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:00.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.920]   Because you can't put it upside down.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:06.120]   Still, still, still the right to go when you're streaming is.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.560]   You can't put the camera in upside down.
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:08.560]   Is there a phone in upside down?
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.920]   No, you can do it upside down.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:10.920]   You can.
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:11.920]   Absolutely.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:12.920]   You can rig it.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.920]   You can rig it right side up or upside down.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.720]   But this doesn't still have the light.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:17.720]   It's still covered.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:18.720]   But you can, we've mounted it.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:19.720]   We've like, before it's still covered though.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:20.720]   Oh yeah.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:21.720]   No, no, no, you can't.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.720]   Lightenboard master.
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.720]   Yeah, you have to mount it.
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:24.720]   It does go in that way.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.720]   It is a weird, that is a weird choice, isn't it?
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:28.720]   I don't know why.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.960]   That's a good way to keep people from us doing that because it probably would be bad for
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:32.960]   the, for the gimbal.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:36.200]   That's probably why they did it, but it's still annoying.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.800]   Oh, because you have something attached.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.200]   Telling what I would attach.
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.200]   Anything.
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:43.880]   Yeah, they should give you a lightning out.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.720]   The bottom of the gimbal or something, maybe like, you know, like that.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:51.560]   I mean, and you can try to, the hard part is just, you know, Wi-Fi is not a very, you
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:56.800]   know, you're, yeah, it's not a great solution.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:00.520]   So let's talk about, I'm sorry, Alex, it just makes me spend money.
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:01.520]   That's all.
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.000]   Let's talk about iOS 11 helps you shoot photos straight from the heart.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.720]   This is Renee Richie's long piece that he did.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:17.200]   This is why he wasn't here last week about how iOS 11 is going to change how camera
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:21.400]   works on iPhone 7 or any, any iPhone, right?
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.800]   So what's going to be new in iOS 11?
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:27.160]   So I mean, there's part of it that's new just for the iPhone 7 plus and for whatever
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:30.360]   other dual camera systems Apple puts out this fall.
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.920]   And that is the portrait mode has gotten a lot more powerful.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:36.520]   Previously it was tuned mostly for facial recognition and you could get away with shooting
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.240]   things like coffee, which I kept doing.
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:41.560]   You know, it wasn't perfect and it had trouble with some reflections and angles and things.
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.720]   And now it does a much better job.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.640]   It's tuned for flowers.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:48.760]   Even I did a shot of a fence there where it picks up the fence and then blurs everything
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.760]   behind the fence.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:52.800]   So it's gotten much more sophisticated in what it can do.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:56.400]   And one of the really cool things is with Apple's new heave, the high efficiency image
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.760]   format is it keeps the depth data separate.
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.600]   It doesn't burn it in anymore into the image.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.040]   They're replacing JPEG with heave.
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:04.040]   Yes.
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:05.040]   Yes.
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:08.200]   Which is like, it's like the H.265 version of.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:12.000]   So it's more compact, more compact than JPEG.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.480]   And it's yeah, so it does take slightly longer to process.
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:17.160]   But for video that's more of a deal than it is for images, images are still lightning
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.200]   fast and it gives you better compression.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.920]   But mostly it bundles things together.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.560]   So instead of having live photos that have a separate JPEG and movie file, it's just
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.720]   the data is there together.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:30.360]   Instead of having a copy of the depth photo and the depth is burned in and irregular,
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.640]   you have a photo that has a depth data.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.520]   So you can get the blur effect, but also a filter, for example, could apply things based
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:40.480]   on the depth data like this, the new silver tone filter in iOS 11.
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:44.360]   It will change the way it processes the filter based on the depth data contained in the photo.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:47.240]   Here's an example you took of, are these your nieces of two?
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:48.880]   My god, my god, kids.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:54.320]   So there's a difference in contrast even from the foreground and the background.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.520]   Yeah, and they're calling it the depth the API.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:59.680]   So that's available to developers too, so they can start doing things with the different
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.680]   depth data.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.680]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.800]   I don't, you'd have to use regions in Lightroom to do this.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:08.680]   This would be a significant amount of time to make it look like this.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.160]   That's a very interesting effect.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.160]   And I like it.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.960]   I think it's a really nice effect.
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:17.000]   Yeah, it's one of the things that get from having a format so you can pull these photos
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.800]   over to your Mac or to your iPad and completely change the way it is.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.600]   So HEIF is a standard.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:26.520]   Yes, but it will be important.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.880]   No, and there's the API.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:32.240]   So the hope is that with a lot of these things that the adoption will, I mean, we're still
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:35.240]   using GIF from the computer.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:40.800]   So probably what you would do is you would capture it and HEIF, process it on the iPhone
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.880]   and export a JPEG for posting on Instagram or anywhere else.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.480]   And there's some hope that Adobe and other companies will support it.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:49.280]   Like you even do things like turn it into an alpha layer so that you can do a lot of
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.640]   different things with it.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:58.800]   So using that grayscale, whether it's in compositing, in After Effects or Photoshop,
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.920]   there's a lot of filters that can take advantage of a grayscale image that's given you depth
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:07.760]   information for either there's actually, I think when you do the lens blur in Photoshop,
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:11.960]   it already asks you, I mean, there's a dropdown that says, give me a black and white that gives
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.440]   me the depth and I can, you know, do that.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.440]   So there's a bunch of options there.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.840]   And then for live photos, it's one of those things, it's almost Microsoft.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.240]   And you know, when they put out something that nobody really understands and then it
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.760]   gets better and better and better over the years and live photos are sort of like that
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.320]   now because it's not just you take a photo and you get a little bit of animation on each
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.320]   side.
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.480]   And then you get live photos a lot better where you have again, that single container, but
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:38.920]   it also, the quality is so high now that you can choose any frame is the key frame and
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.840]   you can start, you can crop them and you can edit them.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.440]   And this has a bunch of fun effects, almost like Instagram, but you're not bound to the
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.440]   song.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.440]   This is bound.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.440]   They're calling it bounce because I guess Boomerang was taken.
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:53.400]   So it's just, you know, it goes in and out and there's fade and there's loop and it does
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.600]   long exposure too.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.200]   So if you're, if you're doing a different, like if you're taking traffic going by or
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:01.600]   light streaming by, you can press the long exposure button and we'll pull it out and
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:02.600]   motion blur it.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.760]   Is this, is this in the camera app itself?
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.000]   See, in the, you know, in the camera app and the photos app because they're sort of blended
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000]   a little bit together.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.280]   So you just swipe up on the photo that you've just taken and you can add all these effects
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.280]   to it.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.760]   And it's based on the same live photo data and it stays editable.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.280]   So you can do this effect.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:22.040]   So this is the loop filter we're looking at, which is how is this different than the bounce
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.040]   filter?
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.800]   Oh, it's just going to go in a certain, the bounce, I'm switching between the two there
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:27.840]   because again, it's not destructive.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.840]   So you can have the bounce.
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.360]   No, no, I don't really like it.
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:31.880]   I want to make it a loop.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:35.280]   And yet you can do these things in Instagram, for example, or you could do these in Snapchat,
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.680]   but then you're stuck in that platform.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:41.160]   And if you want to send it to, you know, uncle Bill who doesn't use social networks, it's
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:45.280]   a real process to get it out where with this, it's just, it's, it will send it as a live
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:50.440]   photo to anyone on iOS and it will burn it out as an animated GIF to anybody not on iOS.
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.520]   So you can, you can just share it over messages.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.480]   You can, you can even drop the file to somebody if you want to.
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:58.640]   It just gives you the ability to quickly make this is a step forward and portrait.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:01.280]   This is called this is live photo.
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.800]   No, I'm looking at grid now.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.800]   So tell me about this.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:05.960]   What's what's going on here?
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:09.200]   So down that if you scroll down, there's also a really cute little feature that they've
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.200]   got in there.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:15.320]   I was waiting a little bit higher up where they have a, a level that I put it in there.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320]   I think it's in there somewhere.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.560]   I might have forgot to put it in there, but there's a new feature is a level in the iOS
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:23.240]   camera app now where if you go, or if you move the camera so you're shooting straight
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:28.960]   down or straight up, it super imposes a cross mark.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.440]   Sorry, had trust marks on it.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.720]   And then you can put those over on top of each other and it makes sure that the photo
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.720]   is level.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:38.720]   So your brunch looks perfect or your dramatic upshot of the building looks spot on.
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.320]   Oh, so it fixes the tilt or?
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.560]   Yeah, it fades in and then you can make sure it's tilted perfectly to get the exact downward
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.560]   shot, not on an angle.
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.920]   And then it fades out again.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.720]   And it only works if you have the grid on because they sort of feel that people who
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.800]   are obsessed enough to have a grid on really care about that sort of thing and they won't
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800]   bug you with that data.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.800]   That's perfect.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.800]   They're exactly right.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.080]   Yeah, if you're using a grid, you'd want to know that.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.920]   And but so he is a standard.
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.080]   It's it's a ISO standards, MPEG.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.480]   It's just not widely supported yet, but it makes sense that Apple should push us forward.
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.800]   No one gives you a lot more information.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.640]   There'll be a lot more of a standard when there's 70 million phones that are.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.640]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:12.640]   Right.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:15.880]   That's to me, to me, the big deal is just that the fact that it's a container because
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:20.240]   now there's so much data is being collected that even when I'm taking pictures with again,
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:24.440]   my old, tiny Lumix camera here, it's like, okay, so there's a JPEG.
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.840]   There is also a raw picture.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.160]   There is also for video.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.800]   There's also another sidecar file that has been written for another piece of software
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:32.800]   to pick up.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:38.080]   It'd be nice if as computational photography is being provided with so much different
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.600]   pieces of information, if a phone can be empowered to say, you know what?
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:47.840]   We're going to write to this file every single scrap of data we use for ourselves internally
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:53.080]   to build this JPEG so that a more sophisticated app today or 10 years from now can exploit
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:57.560]   that exact same information to make this picture even better because a JPEG is a JPEG
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:02.880]   is a JPEG, but a JPEG with raw data plus depth information.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.560]   That's cool stuff in 2019.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.760]   When you're using a JPEG, what you've basically said is to the software of the camera.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:10.760]   All right.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:17.680]   You make the decisions about exposure and everything, create a burned image that is fixed and
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:21.560]   export that, but you can't do much to that JPEG.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:24.800]   You've lost everything but that actual image has developed.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.880]   In effect, you're getting a developed image in that.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:30.800]   But with the heap format, you've still got all the data.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:34.720]   You've got a render, the JPEG render, but you also got the data that contributed to the
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.400]   render so you could change your mind.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.080]   In other words, and I think that one of the pressures that's going to be applied to most
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:45.200]   of the other software manufacturers to support it is that Apple does have its own photo software.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.200]   That's going to take advantage of that.
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:54.720]   You know, so as you start to have photos, being able to change depth or some people are going
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:58.080]   to be like, "Wow, I don't want to take it into the Lightroom because I don't have enough
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:59.080]   control."
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:03.040]   I mean, that's the danger that Adobe has if they don't support the format.
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.000]   So I have a feeling that we're going to see the format get supported within 12 months.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.320]   Is this image in Chainlink fence image Renee?
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.240]   Is this an example of portrait mode?
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:15.960]   So in the past, portrait had to have a human face or if we were lucky your dog might be.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:16.960]   It was optimized for it.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.960]   Yeah, it was optimized for that.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.840]   It had a great deal of difficulty.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.480]   And so what they've done now is again, it understands more scenes than it did before.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:25.200]   It understands more objects than it did before.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.960]   And also it can go to lower light levels than it could before and it'll even work with a
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:28.960]   flash now.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.720]   So they're just trying to make portrait mode work in a far wider range of circumstance.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:38.480]   So this is, I would say, an extraordinarily tough image, which is a focus is on the Chainlink
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:39.840]   fence.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.120]   Now in truth, the actual image, the camera, phone picked up, probably had everything in
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.120]   focus.
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:53.320]   It was probably a very high aperture was very closed down and very high aperture.
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:59.360]   But what it did, it was able to use the depth information to defocus the back plane, keep
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:02.040]   the front plane in focus and to do it almost perfect.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.680]   I don't see any flaws in this.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:06.560]   And I don't think smooth edges are one of the easier things to do.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:08.560]   You know, while you know it's so hard.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.840]   You're doing something like that in front of a, you know, some care would be tough.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:13.840]   It's something that we always want to do.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:16.760]   And some of the earlier photos that are in Renee's article, I think actually show a
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.440]   much better hair resolution than we've seen in the past.
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:21.440]   Here's an example of it.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.960]   It's a little soft, but it's there, you know, it's probably missing a little bit.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.160]   There's some problems, but you don't know.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.680]   I mean, it's a little out of focus.
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:28.680]   But I'm zoomed way in.
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:33.000]   I don't think that would be problematic as I've seen the portrait mode be.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.600]   So I think that there's definitely some improvements going on there.
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:38.640]   And the thing with the Chainlink fangs is not so much that it's a smooth service, but
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:41.680]   that it recognizes it's the Chainlink fence and doesn't try to find a face to lock the
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:42.680]   view for portrait mode.
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:43.680]   Right.
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:44.680]   And I think that I can get fooled.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:48.560]   I believe that I'm not totally certain, but I believe that a lot of that has to do with,
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:53.640]   you know, basically what you're seeing in that live in the live photo is small movements
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:59.200]   in the camera's position, even micro movements in that camera position allows it with the
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:03.040]   two lenses, allow it to look at parallax and make a decision about what's close and what's
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.040]   far away.
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:09.480]   And it's interesting too, because now with a lot of those filters, it also does image
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:10.480]   stabilization.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:14.160]   When you're doing the live photo and then you tell it to do a loop or you tell it to
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.880]   do a motion blur, it'll lock on everything that's not moving, stabilize that.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.480]   And that makes the loop or the bounce or the long exposure even more evident, like water
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:27.440]   flowing or hair twirling those sorts of things.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.360]   So it's neat stuff.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.600]   So I am now really excited about getting the new iPhone.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:36.600]   Between AR.
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:38.320]   Oh, I think it's going to be.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.240]   Oh, and that camera system is going to, by all the indications, the camera system on
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.960]   there is going to be another big step forward.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.200]   This by itself would be enough.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.920]   I think that the issue is that the camera manufacturer, the hard part about this is
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.440]   just the trajectory of, you know, they're doing the best they can in a somewhat constrain,
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:59.320]   you know, a market that's actually getting smaller, their little island is getting smaller,
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:03.280]   revenue is getting smaller, and you have not just Apple, but Apple and Google and a lot
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.040]   of other folks that they're spending.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:13.240]   I mean, the phone being able to take great photos is a huge part of why we buy a new upgrade.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.240]   Right.
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:18.160]   And so I mean, I heard the number was 200 or 250, you know, engineers that are just working
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:21.600]   on the camera, you know, for Apple.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.360]   And it's just hard when Apple's going to throw the, Apple's throwing the amount of money
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:31.040]   at this problem that Canon makes every, you know, Canon makes every year.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:36.120]   You know, that's the real challenge for camera manufacturers is that it's just an enormous
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.600]   amount of energy being put into computational photography.
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:42.800]   And they're a computer company doing it, which means they have a lot of the in-house talent
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.120]   to really handle the edge cases.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.760]   And they know how to make interfaces.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:47.760]   Sorry.
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:53.520]   And while Google does control the Pixel phone and probably will make a very exciting Pixel
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.080]   phone this year, most Android phones are not made by Google, which means they don't control
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.080]   the hardware.
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.080]   It's hard.
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:02.960]   You know, Samsung does its own camera thing, which is quite good, quite capable, but it's
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:03.960]   different.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:04.960]   Right.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.880]   Well, that's why that they have the, they have their camera app that can be installed
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:09.720]   on individual Android phones.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:14.520]   That's why they're selling their, the strength of their camera system as being the Google
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:15.520]   Assistant.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.920]   So that once you, we can't control how you take that picture, but believe me, once you
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.920]   get that picture on our servers, we're going to send back, we're going to drift back down
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:27.080]   a much better version of it than your crummy little blister pack, CVS pharmacy phone was
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:28.080]   able to take.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:32.320]   So actually Renee makes that point right at the beginning of his article that Google
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.600]   has to do with server side.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.840]   Apple can do it because they control the hardware on the, on the phone.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.480]   I'm now, I'm excited.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.640]   I can't, I can't wait.
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.880]   We're going to, we're going to know soon enough.
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:44.040]   It's a, in all likelihood, a month away.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.840]   It's amazing how fast it's going.
[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:47.840]   That's called life.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:51.960]   It gets faster as you get farther down the slide.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.920]   Every year is a smiley part of your name.
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:54.920]   Right.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920]   Right.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.920]   It makes sense.
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:00.520]   Every year is now only one sixtieth of my life.
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:04.240]   Before it was half your life and then the third of your life.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:05.240]   Oh, you're right.
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:06.600]   Oh, but I'm super excited.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.720]   And again, these point previously, the competition just makes them all better because it is such
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:13.920]   a big selling feature that, you know, everyone talks about the power of the camera and everyone
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:15.680]   has to race to keep up with that.
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:18.680]   Let's take a break.
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:22.320]   When we come back, your picks of the week, fellas, you're up for that.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.320]   I'm ready.
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:24.320]   Let's get going.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:29.320]   I want to congratulate texture.
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:33.280]   Today on the new iOS 11 App Store, if you don't have iOS 11, I don't know if they still
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.800]   do that on iOS 10.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:36.800]   Do they Renee?
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:37.800]   The new App Store is great.
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.280]   It's got all these picks and, you know, it's got little kits and all sorts of stuff.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.280]   I really like that.
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:44.280]   It'll be updated more frequently when it's out of beta.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.560]   But this today, texture is the app of the day.
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.160]   And rightly so, texture is amazing.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:59.080]   Think of texture, I think the easiest way to describe it is texture is Netflix for magazines.
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:03.080]   So there are hundreds of great magazines out there.
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:07.400]   And if you were to subscribe to them all, well, it just cost you a ton.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:13.000]   But what if, instead of subscribing to every magazine, or gosh, it'd be even worse if you
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.840]   went out and bought them all, right?
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:21.440]   What if you had every magazine possible available to you?
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.680]   And you just got to read them on your iPad.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:26.560]   Well, that's what texture is.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.920]   More than 200 of the best magazines, everything.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:33.760]   At this point, I don't know what magazines aren't on texture, but everything I want to
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:34.760]   read.
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:35.760]   Look at this.
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.760]   This is the list.
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:43.280]   Everything from ARP, the magazine to yoga journal, and everything in between backpacker,
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:51.960]   Canadian cycling, Canadian running, CBS soaps in depth, Oprah, the Oprah magazine, Teen
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:54.920]   Vogue, regular Vogue, Vanity Fair.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.920]   You know what?
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.360]   There is an article every month I want to read in Vanity Fair.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360]   It's on there.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.360]   It's on there.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:05.400]   And the thing is when you subscribe to texture, it's 10 bucks a month, you get access to any
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:06.400]   of these magazines.
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:09.040]   You favorite the magazines, you know, you want all the time.
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.200]   I get national geographic.
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.800]   That's absolutely when I automatically download.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.320]   One of the reasons I love it is a national geographic images.
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:19.240]   In fact, any magazine with great pictures are better on the iPad than they are in print.
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:20.240]   They don't have to be screened.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:23.600]   You get kind of the digital image, which is amazing.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:30.040]   Plus, you get features in magazines you can't get in print like video.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.480]   There's curated pics.
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:34.520]   So if you don't know what to read, look at all the computer magazines, PC Magazine, PC
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:39.440]   World, Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, Shutterbug, love that magazine.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.440]   And Wired.
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.560]   There's always something I want to read in Wired.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:44.320]   Sound and Vision for you, audio geeks.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.840]   The thing is you may not subscribe to Billboard.
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:50.360]   That's expensive of a variety or ad age or sound and vision.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:51.560]   But you don't have to.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.800]   With texture, you've got the entire issue.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.360]   Every page, including the ads, it's the whole thing.
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.680]   Fit pregnancy and baby magazine, Girls Life, Boys Life.
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:06.840]   Every once in a while I want to read Boys Life and go back to my youth.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.760]   And it's so much fun.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:16.160]   Road and Track, golfers, golf magazine, golf tips, men's journal, men's health, reminisce,
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:17.600]   cruising the classics.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.200]   I tell you what, here we go.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.280]   We got a two week free trial for you right now.
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:24.320]   If you go to texture.com/tweet, you don't have to take my word for it.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.840]   But I should warn you, as soon as you sign up and download the texture app and put it
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.600]   on your phone or your tablet, you're going to say, "Oh, I can't live without this."
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.320]   And if you travel, if you're going away this summer, why bring a stack of magazines to the
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:36.320]   beach?
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.320]   Just bring your tablet.
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:38.320]   And you've got them all.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.920]   So texture.com/tweet, one of Apple's top 2016 iPads.
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:48.360]   And today it's the pick of the day on the new iOS 11 App Store.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:52.280]   And rightly so, texture.com/tweet.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:53.280]   Try it today.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:54.560]   Time for the picks of the week.
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.440]   I think we're going to give you Alex Lindsay, the pride of place here since we rarely get
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:48:59.440]   to see in studio.
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:00.440]   Did you bring some?
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:03.880]   By the way, you pick this wallet case.
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:04.880]   We should show this.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.400]   You picked that a couple of weeks ago.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.400]   And they really...
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:10.680]   I'm not sure your credit cards, but it's nice looking.
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:11.680]   It's got a nice leather.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:13.920]   It's really worn like a good wallet.
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.360]   It's a little bit worn.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.360]   It's a little...
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:17.360]   I love that.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:21.560]   You know, it's definitely worn for wear on the side.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.560]   I'm going to get that.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:23.560]   But it's great.
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:24.920]   I'm going to wait until the new iPhone comes.
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:25.920]   It does limit.
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.480]   It doesn't shut quite right if you put too much in it.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.480]   Yeah, mine constantly.
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:31.320]   There's a certain number of cards that I can keep in, which is plenty.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:35.560]   The thing is I never misplace my phone or my wallet because one of the other, I lose
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.560]   them.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:39.280]   I need both of them too often to make it work.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.280]   So it's good.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:42.280]   Anyway, that was a pig in the previous life.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.280]   Still work.
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:44.280]   What do you have for us today?
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:47.720]   So in my house, you know, I had some dead spots for Wi-Fi.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.720]   And I was...
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:50.200]   And we've got this crazy Sonos system.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.200]   There's like a whole bunch of Sonos that weren't...
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:53.680]   Sonos is in Wi-Fi.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:55.120]   They will kill Wi-Fi fast.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.240]   Well, and I wired them partially.
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.240]   So there's...
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:00.240]   Because there's...
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.240]   You could do that.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:02.240]   You could have a...
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:03.240]   They're amazing.
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.880]   You update one and they just go, "Whoop!"
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:06.880]   You know, and...
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:07.880]   And...
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:08.880]   But...
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:09.880]   I did that.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:11.880]   And so the...
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:15.240]   And there's like, you know, there's a lot in the house anyway.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.240]   So...
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:18.600]   But getting the Wi-Fi working and getting it working for the phones, getting it working
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.400]   for my Amazon...
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.840]   You know, in different rooms, you know, I have the Amazon thing that I won't say.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:26.600]   And then I'm also testing.
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:27.840]   We just have Google Home.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:30.520]   So we have all those things that are floating around and they were all having trouble and
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:31.520]   they were all not quite working.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:32.880]   So I decided I just got to solve this.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:37.320]   And so I wanted something that I have a little bit more control than just a regular Wi-Fi
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.320]   setup.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.320]   So I got Ubiquities Amplify.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.320]   Oh, interesting.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:43.760]   So we're using heavier versions of Ubiquities for other things.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.760]   Yeah, it's the enterprise solution.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:47.560]   It's a really good solution for that.
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.000]   And at the office, we use a lot of Moraki systems.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000]   But the...
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.160]   Actually, I think Megan's got my Amplify if somebody wants to go get it.
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:55.160]   Right.
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:56.160]   And so this is what you do is you hook up...
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:58.360]   You got the HD, not the...
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:50:59.360]   You got the...
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:00.360]   The...
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:01.360]   There's two of them.
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.120]   I got the one that's showing right here.
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:04.120]   You get the one that...
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.120]   Well, they both look like that.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.520]   But you want to get the one that's Tri-Band.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:07.520]   There's a dual band.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:08.520]   I did get a Tri-Band.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:09.520]   I did get a good one.
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:10.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:11.520]   It's a little more expensive, but it's worth it.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:15.800]   So I put that in there and I've been really happy with it.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:17.640]   It's a little bit more setup than I expected.
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:20.120]   I did have to call Comcast and work through.
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:21.120]   Really?
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:22.120]   Yeah, it just would not.
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.120]   It wouldn't show up.
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.880]   They had to reset something on their end to make that work.
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:29.200]   Now, admittedly, I also changed the modem a day before.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:30.320]   So that might have been part of it.
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:37.200]   But once I got that sorted out, setting up the access points and just setting up the
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:38.200]   little...
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:39.200]   The little mesh.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:40.200]   The most plug into the wall, which is nice.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:43.000]   And so you find kind of discrete places to put them.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.880]   The nice thing about it is that there isn't...
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:50.640]   It's a mesh, so if it can't see the host, it's a little bit slower, but it works.
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:53.320]   And so you just kind of plug it in.
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.720]   You see it on your iPhone.
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:55.640]   You interconnect it.
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:57.320]   I think they're really good looking too.
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:58.320]   I really have to say.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.520]   Once you plug it in, you've got the readout on the front.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.840]   And then it forms a router on the back.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.360]   So if you look at it on the back, you've got a couple outputs to do the routing on it.
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:07.800]   And what you can do is you can also set up multiple networks.
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:11.000]   And what's nice about it is you can set up guest networks.
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000]   So someone's coming over.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.200]   You can set up a guest network just for them.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.200]   It's kind of funny.
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:15.200]   You can say, you know, like...
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:19.280]   So when they come in and they look at their phone, it'll be like Richard's Wi-Fi.
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:20.280]   Use this, Richard.
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.280]   The password is.
[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:22.280]   The password is.
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:24.280]   But it's only open for like three hours.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.280]   Right.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.280]   And so while they're there, they have Wi-Fi.
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:27.280]   And it's not on your...
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.720]   It's its own SSID.
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:31.280]   And so the...
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:34.280]   You know, I think that it...
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:35.280]   Again, I think it works.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:38.960]   It's not the same as, you know, people try to compare it to the professional version.
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:41.960]   And there's a lot of things the professional version does.
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:44.200]   But when you look at it on the setup...
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.840]   But this was relatively easy to...
[01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:49.080]   Once I got it up, you just keep on adding points as you need them.
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:52.520]   And so I've gotten like four points in the base station in my house.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:59.360]   And now everything is... it went from being rocky to smooth without a lot of work.
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:02.040]   These are the satellite units.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.240]   And you plug them into the wall and then you can...
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.840]   What's nice is you can aim them.
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:08.360]   But I got scared because one day I knocked this off.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:09.360]   Right.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.360]   But it's just a magnet.
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:11.360]   Yeah, you just pop it right back in.
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.360]   It's like the nest outdoor.
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.360]   I love that.
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.960]   It's like the nest outdoor.
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:19.960]   It's...
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:20.960]   So anyway, it works well.
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:24.400]   Over time, it took about a half an hour for it to...
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:25.400]   I restarted it.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:26.400]   I was doing something else.
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:28.920]   And suddenly it really built the mesh out really nicely.
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:31.000]   That's one thing that does happen with all of these solutions.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000]   They get better over time.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.360]   They get smarter over time.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:34.840]   And how many of the base...
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:35.840]   How many of the...
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:36.840]   I put four in.
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:41.720]   I put one in my wife's office to make sure she was getting strong Wi-Fi.
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:45.040]   I mean, the house has...
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.000]   I couldn't have gotten away with other things.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.840]   My house has cat-five in almost every major room.
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:50.920]   So it's not so jealous.
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:52.920]   So I still cat-five at the...
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:55.480]   At the thing, but just having my phones and my...
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:56.480]   Everything else would work.
[01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:58.720]   That's one thing that this doesn't do that both the Iro and the plume do.
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:01.160]   They have ethernets on all the satellites.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:05.960]   And if you have ethernet jacks in that room, you can connect them and it builds an even
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:09.280]   stronger network because it's got an ethernet backhaul.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:12.040]   And I thought about it and I just realized that I just want to plug it in.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.040]   At the...
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:20.040]   We're building large meshes with their professional line where you're doing PoE that powers them
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.320]   and gives them ethernet and so on and so forth.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:22.320]   I think...
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.320]   But anyway, I was pretty happy with it.
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:25.720]   We've used it, but I think we're using Ruckus today.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:26.720]   Ruckus are good too.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:27.720]   Ruckus are very good too.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:29.720]   The Amplify...
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:31.360]   And it turns out they don't sell the other one anymore, I guess.
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:37.880]   The HD is the one they sell at Amplify.com, AMPLI, F-I.com.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:40.160]   Home Wi-Fi.
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:41.360]   And I'll tell you, we have...
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:44.400]   I wish you'd told me because this one's just been sitting around here because I bought
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:47.400]   it for testing, but nobody seems to want it.
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:49.680]   We'll check that, Leo.
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:50.680]   I have them all.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:51.680]   I use them all.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:55.960]   At home, I have the new Eros, the sponsor, and I have plumes because I have two networks
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:56.960]   and I use them all.
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:57.960]   Well, my office...
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:01.720]   And my office have also have a morocchi because that ties me into the office.
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:02.720]   Exactly.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:03.720]   Forget a mesh, you have a weave network.
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:04.720]   They're different...
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:09.520]   Well, it's different uses for different use cases, but there you go, you're Amplify.
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:10.520]   And that's not even an Alex.
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:11.840]   It's an half an Alex.
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:15.280]   I'm afraid I have a phone call that I thought this was a safe time to schedule it.
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:16.280]   See you later.
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:17.280]   Thank you Alex.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.280]   Thanks guys.
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.280]   It is normal.
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:20.280]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:23.280]   Well, I have two really quick picks because I was talking a lot about photography this
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:24.280]   week.
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:25.280]   I was playing with some more photo apps.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:28.880]   And one of them is a really nice indie app by Ben Rice called Obscura.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:30.200]   It's a camera app.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:34.120]   One of the things Apple hasn't done and won't do is put a lot of fussy manual controls
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:35.120]   in their camera app.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.480]   It's meant for what exactly Andy said earlier in the show is that you just want to pick
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:42.280]   up the phone, take a photo, and get a really good result and not have to worry about it
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.840]   or fuss with it too much.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:46.280]   So what they've done is create a lot of APIs for developers.
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:50.520]   Let's them do things like pull out the high dynamic range data, the high color data, the
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:55.520]   DCI-P3 data, the raw camera data, and then developers can make apps that let you tweak
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.680]   exposure or focus or all these different things.
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:01.280]   Obscura is one of those and it's a really nice design.
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:04.960]   Ben is sort of really well known because he photographs a lot of the Apple conferences
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:09.560]   like Ull and he used to do Singleton and it takes really, really nice photos and he sort
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:12.320]   of built his dream camera app out of this.
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.240]   So it gives you a lot of control and a lot of power over what you do with the iPhone
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.240]   camera but it's still in an interface that's very simple and very accessible.
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:24.040]   So if you want to take the plunge, if you want to go beyond Apple's built-in camera
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:27.960]   app but you don't want to go into something really complicated, I'd recommend Obscura.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:33.000]   It's just a really nice way to get your feet wet with manual controls and with raw data
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.640]   and things like that.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:37.960]   And the second one is that the opposite end of the spectrum and this is a huge mega company,
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:42.280]   Adobe, they're doing a better job and they haven't brought full on Photoshop to the iPad
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:46.120]   which a lot of people would still like them to do but they have brought Lightroom to the
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.400]   iPad and it's fairly good.
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:50.580]   It's not exactly Lightroom as you know and love on the desktop but it's Lightroom that
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:51.880]   can do a lot of things.
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:56.680]   I would say the interface is more challenging and Adobe has a really hard and complex problem
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:01.400]   to solve on an iPad so it is a little bit harder to learn.
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.480]   The learning curve is a little bit steeper but you get access if you're already, especially
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:09.160]   if you're a creative cloud subscriber, you have access to your library, you have access
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:10.440]   to all your photos.
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:13.840]   And if you are on the go, if you're winding down, if you have your feet up, if you're
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:17.280]   in the coffee shop and you just want to take those photos that you've shot and maybe you've
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.560]   worked on them on your desktop or you've taken them with your phone or you've taken them
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:24.160]   with a camera and uploaded them earlier, you can just pull those onto your iPad and do
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:29.680]   like a gradient mask and play around with, make the sun look just, make the stars look
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:34.560]   just the way you like it or bring out all the detail in the ground that's below the bright,
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:38.640]   bright sky and make the photo look more like what you remember it looking like.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:42.880]   And while it is complicated, it is still super fast and I find I can get results using it
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:46.920]   in a few minutes that I'd probably, I want to say waste but spend a lot more time on
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:48.320]   the desktop trying to emulate it.
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:52.400]   So two very different apps but both really great for someone who wants to do more photography
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.160]   and we should mention that obscure is free.
[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:59.080]   I, that kind of blows me away that he gives us away for free.
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:00.520]   I wish you a charge a lot of money.
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:03.920]   I mean, he, I believe he started off charging a lot for it, but it's a hard market.
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:09.400]   So, Apple does give the app access to the raw data.
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:12.720]   They have APIs for almost everything and now they're going to have APIs for the depth
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:13.720]   data.
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:14.720]   They have APIs for the raw data.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:20.080]   They have APIs for exposure and for focus and for ISO.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:21.600]   I mean, just almost anything you can think of.
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:23.240]   They're giving you an API for it these days.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:27.840]   I wonder if Ben will start charging say, you know, free for the iPhone 7 version, but
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:30.200]   if you want to the iPhone 8 version, start charging for that.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:31.200]   I'm almost shy.
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:33.200]   I didn't know it was free because I said, "It's pretty sure it was paid."
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:34.200]   It's paid.
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.200]   $4.99 here.
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:37.960]   Oh, I must have bought it then because I thought it was.
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:38.960]   I thought it was.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:41.360]   I must have bought it before because it didn't cost me anything to download it.
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:42.880]   $4.99 is a good deal.
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:43.880]   That's that's the deal.
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:45.880]   I'm glad he is charging for it.
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:47.320]   I would have had to DM him right after the show, if not.
[01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:48.320]   Say, yeah, really.
[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.960]   Oh, thank you, Andy.
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.720]   I, for some reason, I must have bought this once before.
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:56.840]   I wish that, yeah, the app store would fix that because sometimes you want to recommend
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:59.600]   an app to somebody or sometimes you want to buy.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:01.880]   You want to carry with that to somebody, but you don't know.
[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:03.880]   I'm in Iowa today all the time.
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:08.760]   I have to ask that TD is not buy it and tell them to find it on Canadian.
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:09.760]   Yeah, it's.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:10.760]   That's another thing.
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:17.160]   And by the way, once again, my pick of the week, go to headlines.com and get the Justin
[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:20.920]   Trudeau Bear Chested Canada.
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:21.920]   Oh, man.
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:22.920]   Tiblon.
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:30.680]   One of those Canadian keys in the setting on a polar bear and serenity called Will.
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:31.680]   The Rockies.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:36.280]   And a hundred percent pure true down.
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:38.280]   I like that.
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:42.760]   Andy and I go, you're big of the week.
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:47.320]   Don't forget that Mac OS has really great scripting options and automation.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:51.120]   And if you are not aware of that, take control books has a really good book.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:57.680]   Joe Kistle has just updated his take control of automating your Mac to a second.
[01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:01.640]   The second edition is 15 bucks, but it'll walk you through all the different ways.
[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:07.120]   That you can take processes that take multiple steps on your Mac and have it just triggered
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:10.240]   by a script or not even have to trigger it at all.
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:13.980]   You just simply have a folder where things if things landed in the folder, then magical
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:15.920]   things start to happen.
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:22.040]   All kinds of it also covers things like all the way from Apple script, Automator to shell
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:27.720]   scripts to I think that it even goes to certain things you can do on iOS, things you can do
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:31.240]   with Siri, Mac Rose and Microsoft Office.
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:35.520]   You have no idea how much time you're wasting on your Mac that is not related to Twitter
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:39.960]   or Instagram until you read a book like this and you realize that with maybe a couple
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:45.280]   of hours of effort maximum, you can take something that you always have to do that sucks 15
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:49.160]   minutes each and every time and turn into just a simple menu or a simple thing you double
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:50.960]   click on and it automatically works.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:55.480]   I really wish that Apple would spend a lot more time promoting Automator and Apple script
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:01.280]   and the automation features because it's not as though you can't automate things on Linux
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:06.800]   or Windows but I don't think that either of those have the same kind of consumer friendly,
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:09.040]   user friendly tools for doing that sort of stuff.
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:14.920]   $15 go to take control books.com and another quick plug that if you are in San Francisco
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:21.160]   Bay area in Santa Clara, California, tomorrow is the Commandee Masters of Automation Conference
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:29.240]   where Salsa go in and Naomi and Paul can are putting together, have put together an entire
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:39.920]   day long conference all about automation solutions on macOS and on iOS as being sponsored by
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:47.200]   the Omni Group that is as well invested in automation as pretty much more than any other
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:52.680]   company these days and it's great people, great people to hang out with.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:56.900]   It's the first year of doing this and it was one of the people organizing this is Paul
[02:01:56.900 --> 02:02:02.080]   Candacors who used to organize nothing less than Mac world Expo every single year.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.920]   So you can feel like this is going to be the ground floor.
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:06.520]   I think something is going to be really, really cool.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:10.600]   I hope to be there next year because this just looks just super, super cool.
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:24.080]   It does start tomorrow.
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:26.760]   You can sign up through Eventbrite and be there tomorrow and hang out with some cool
[02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:28.520]   people and learn some cool stuff.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:32.440]   I'm so glad you plugged that because I wanted to do that last week and I forgot.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:38.520]   So yeah, it is tomorrow at the Hilton Santa Clara in Santa Clara, California.
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:40.080]   Absolutely awesome.
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:43.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, our time has come to say goodbye to all the family.
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.000]   We already say goodbye to Alex Lindsey, but let's not forget Andy Enoco.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.640]   He's at the Chicago Sun Times, his website, C W O B dot com.
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:54.280]   His flicker account, if you want to see his amazing images is Andy.
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:03:01.840]   I he's on the Twitter I H N A T K O I have no idea how to spell it.

[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:08.880]   I hope you feel better.

[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:10.880]   Thank you.
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:14.040]   Go to your favorite diner and have a bowl of lots of ball soup.
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:15.440]   That's that's on the plan for tomorrow.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:17.880]   If you don't feel better, you'll at least be well fed.
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:21.160]   We're sending Andy power the Kryptonian son.
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:28.080]   There he is master of the power of the Kryptonian son, Mr. Renee Nittrichi at imore.com.
