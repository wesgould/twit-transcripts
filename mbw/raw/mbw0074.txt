[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   It's the Hawkeye and Hot Lips episode.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And who's Hot Lips? Are you Andy?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I want to be Hawkeye.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I would love to be hot.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Everybody wants, you want to be hot Lips?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Okay Merlin Mann gets to be Hot Lips.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Andy and I goes Hawkeye and I'll be radar O'Reilly.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Everyone has the flu except the three of us.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Actually, Samuel like radar today.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And now we've got to run the whole 4077 by ourselves.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And I'm patient zero.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   The vector that get everybody sick.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Everybody kept running up and licking your microphone
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   and I was all seriously.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Don't do that Leo's the very sick man.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Yeah, actually I think that's what happened to Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   He used my headset mic, which probably was a foolish thing to do
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   after I used it.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Coughed all over it.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I don't know what Chris Breen's excuse is, but he's out.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   They're both down with the count and the same thing I had.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Andy and Merlin miraculously avoided any infection at all.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Will we not be replicants?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Well, no, they're good reasons for that.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I was Tony Shalubing my way through bottles of Purell like no one's business.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I was like an alcoholic with these little bottles.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   If I even thought about human contact, that was good for a dime's worth of, you know, of Robin.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Also, I had to teach myself to make sure I keep a handkerchief in my pocket at all times
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   because there are times when you just got to scratch your eyes
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   or you got a rub so that any time I touched my face it was through a close contact.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Well, if you were Tony Shalub, then Merlin Mann must be Howie Mandel.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   What?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I don't want to be Howie Mandel.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Oh, I'm sorry, you're hot lips.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I'm hot lips.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   You know, before I had a daughter, I used to wash my hands approximately quarterly,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   but we decided that we wanted to keep her healthy.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And so I started with always with the hand washing.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I, you know, I'm not going to jinx myself, but I think it does make a difference.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Oh, I do.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Absolutely.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   You know, anyway, it's the three of us and...
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It's big engine.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You know, there's probably just about enough.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Yeah, this we can get to agent Twick.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It's a new show.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   There's probably about enough information for three people anyway.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I mean, after all, we're just coming off Macworld.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   What more can you say?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   We can say that it was the best of times.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It was the worst of times.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Every time that there's a little fellow who's tolling in the fields will be there.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Every time the bulls are against the hobos will be there.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Is that Steve Jode?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Well, we were suffering a little bit of grapes or wrath there in San Francisco.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Now, I think actually it was a very successful Macworld.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.600]   Everybody's very happy.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.000]   There was no, you know, iPhone update, which is kind of a surprise.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I guess he'll save that for another day.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I got to say that, you know, I was one of, I think many people who were thinking, "Oh,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.400]   God, well, I suppose if I can't get a refund on my hotel and my airfare, I guess I'm going
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   to go anyway."
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   You know, everyone pretty much knew what was going to be announced.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   We were all about 95% correct.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   And there was nothing there that was going to be, you know, I must touch the hem of your
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   robe for you had a demo of the new Mac book.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   But yet it was really, really awesome.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   I think most of that is due to the work of Paul Kent and his staff.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   I mean, the show just keeps getting better and better and more solid each and every year.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   Paul Kent is the IDG guy who puts this together.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   Absolutely.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   He's the hand that pulls the strings.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   You and Kathy did an amazing job.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.640]   It's funny, as much as I had such a wonderful experience as a speaker, a lot of people did
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.600]   complain about some of the kind of strangely cattle-like moments in the Western Hall where
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.920]   there was complete gridlock of people like trying to leave the keynote as others were
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.120]   trying to get badges.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.400]   But the speaker from a speaker standpoint, man, they make you feel like a king.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.600]   I'm just going through my bag of swag.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.280]   You know, it was really, I love those moments where I feel really, really stupid, but for
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.280]   great reasons.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.400]   We've all gone through the passion play of my hard drive crash.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.080]   One of the little side effects was that I could no longer use my big 8 gigabyte memory
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.800]   card that was in my camera because on Sunday the day before the crash, I was out all day
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.080]   taking pictures during a walk in San Francisco.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.200]   I'd obviously deleted all the pictures off the card and put them onto the hard drive.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.520]   And so I wasn't worried because I knew that, okay, well, I just won't use that card anymore
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.280]   because I have a utility, a phone that can recover them.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.160]   And of course, then I've wind up later in the week knowing that I'm going to be spending
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.720]   like two or three hours taking a behind the scenes tour of Alcatraz.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.600]   I think, oh God, I really need that card.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   And then I'm just sort of triaging the stuff in my speaker's bag and lo and behold, there
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.280]   is a utility in there, a commercial utility for recovering stuff off of memory cards and
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   clicks, right?
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.280]   Exactly.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.280]   And two hours later, Bob's your uncle.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.360]   I had all my pictures back on the new hard drive and I had a brand new e-race memory card.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.360]   So that worked pretty well.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   That clicks program.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   That was pretty good.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.240]   And so I think we're joking about the quantity of iPod cases that were in that bag.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.720]   Suffice to say that I traveled with, I traveled with like three or four different iPods for
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   all different things.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.960]   And I had to use them all.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.200]   I had new things on at least three of them, but it's a really hefty assortment of really
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.240]   cool stuff, even the stuff that I can't use myself.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.340]   It's like there are going to be a whole, there are going to be a lot of very happy nieces
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.240]   and nephews and sisters in New England.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.760]   Anybody install the new office yet?
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.280]   Oh, brother, did I?
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   And?
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   Oh, man.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.360]   Like I said on the Twitter, man, make yourself at home, office.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   Come on in.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.800]   Put your feet on the couch.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.040]   French kiss my wife.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.120]   Because now I got the icons.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.400]   They're crazy with the icons down in the dock.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   That drives me nuts.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   I don't like the die.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   To me, that's the...
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   And they're ugly icons.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   I don't know why they have such ugly icons.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.560]   And then all of a sudden I'm getting this insane jewel toned entourage pop-up menu of
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   events from 2006.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.520]   And I'm just like, how do I turn this merry-go-round off?
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.520]   And a new word, I don't know.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.200]   It's going to take me a while to get my hat around that.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.440]   Hey, at least it's Intel though.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.160]   I mean, that's I think a big improvement, right?
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.160]   I suppose.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   It still feels...
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.400]   I have not launched it enough, so I'm talking out of my butt a little.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.200]   But it still feels like it's not.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.960]   It ain't like opening text, mate.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.960]   You know, also they're releasing this in a very, very funny time.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.600]   When they released the previous version of Office, they truly had the entire category
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.080]   all to themselves.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.400]   There was no competition.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   There was Mariner, right?
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.400]   There was Nisis, right?
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.200]   There were a couple of little fringe alternatives out there.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.720]   But now they're releasing the new version of Word in a world in which Pages is here.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.600]   And it actually is a very good program.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.360]   They're releasing it in a world where there are specialists, word processors, like Scrivener,
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.120]   that are really, really quite good.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.040]   I haven't installed it yet.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.840]   And remember that again, because of the crash, I've been installing every time I build a
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   new hard drive or get a new machine like this.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.240]   It's like a brand new season of Survivor where all the apps that have had installed for the
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.440]   past two or three years have to re-earn their position on the hard drive.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.280]   It's like real life for your own job.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.280]   I like that.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.120]   That's the best part about losing a hard drive is starting.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.440]   It's like the only time I reinstall a program is the first time I thought, "Oh, God, I need
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.440]   that.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440]   I really, really need that."
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.440]   So BBEdit goes on really, really quickly.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.120]   On the outlet, it goes on really, really quickly.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.120]   Firefox.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.000]   I have yet to install Word because I have Pages on there and I have Scrivener on there.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.720]   And I have BBEdit on there.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.440]   And I've yet to be cut probably because at this point, this is one of those three or
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.880]   four week periods where I don't have to work on a book, I find that I can live quite nicely
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.520]   without Word.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.600]   And I think that numbers will do quite nicely for me as a spreadsheet program.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.160]   And I think that there's enough suffering in my life, self-inflicted, that I don't need
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.280]   to inflict any more suffering on myself with a brand new unproven, untested version of
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.280]   office.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.720]   That seems to be moderately as annoying as real player is in terms of the amount of trouble
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.080]   it makes for you when you just wanted to do one simple thing for you.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.680]   I have a friend who's really believes in social engineering.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.080]   I will not name him, but I use him as an example in talks often because he's doing some disruptive
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.600]   stuff inside of a big company.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.240]   There's two things that he does that I think is fantastic.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.640]   One of the things he does is if you send him an invitation to anything with the default
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.200]   one-hour meeting, he'll send it back to you with a shorter time.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.880]   And second, if you send him anything that he can't open in textEdit, he sends it back
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.880]   to you.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.880]   Is he being a jerk?
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.360]   But what he's saying is, I think it's really interesting to start thinking about what is
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.000]   there in Word that I need that's not in textEdit.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I mean, how much--
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.840]   It's not even safe to be circulating Doc files.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.000]   You turn the macros and stuff like that.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.040]   But it's a really good point, Andy.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.360]   And I think you're actually bringing up something kind of interesting.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.960]   All of these really quotidian applications that we always had kind of ceded to very
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.880]   large companies, drawing programs, write programs, spreadsheet programs.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.480]   These are all things that we're seeing in explosion and really interesting development.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.200]   I mean, God, look at drawing and painting programs alone.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.560]   I mean, for years, you just ceded that to Photoshop and Illustrator, I mean, in my opinion, and
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.160]   to a certain extent, Freehand.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.400]   But now look at all this stuff like Acorn popping up.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:51.040]   And what's the one that all the kids like with all the HUD view that everybody likes?
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   Pixelmator.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.200]   So I mean, I think it's really fascinating that to me, this just shows a lot about the
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.640]   maturity of the Mac community and the developers in the Mac community.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.820]   Understanding that if you take all of these people who are buying on quality and design
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.660]   rather than price, there's also a group of people who will buy on quality and design
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.040]   in the apps that they use every day.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.960]   They're not going to suffer this bloatware just because that's what the people, the friends
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   on Windows use.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.560]   Speaking of Pixelmator, have you guys been following the Mac Heist saga?
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.480]   Do we do Mac Heist here?
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:30.760]   I was really surprised because it's a fantastic bundle, but then I'm saying, my God, this
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:38.200]   is like, ethically, I needed to buy a copy of Snaps Pro because obviously they'll send
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.760]   me a free copy to write about, but this is something that I actually use professionally.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.360]   So I need to buy a copy.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.760]   And so that's been on my to-do list for a long time.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.120]   Then I find that I can buy Snaps Pro plus like two or three other apps I really, really
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.840]   want to have plus three or four others that I haven't used before, but are also great
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.400]   apps for like less than almost a little bit more than half the price of what it would
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.200]   cost me to buy Snaps Pro.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.560]   Yeah, what Pixelmator is on there.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.120]   And now, there was a lot of controversy.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.760]   It has been a lot of controversy over these bundles.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.760]   Right, exactly.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.880]   I was, the surprising part was that I was telling people, I was in a cab with two developers
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.840]   on my way to dinner.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.480]   And I mentioned, wow, this is so cool.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.640]   And on top of everything else, they're donating a certain percentage to charity.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.240]   This is really, really nice.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.920]   And as well, God, you can't be nice to those people.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.160]   I don't want to pass along.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.400]   I'm sure they didn't feel as though they're speaking on the record.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.800]   So I won't pass along what they said specifically.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.440]   But it left me with another item on my to-do list, which is to follow up on Mac Heist
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.040]   to see why these two people seem to have such a negative reaction to the idea of what
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   they're doing.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   I'm kind of following this.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   It's interesting.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.240]   Another great use for Twitter is kind of following along and kind of eavesdropping on
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.240]   your friend's conversations.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.480]   It's like the live version of Wikipedia almost, isn't it?
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   It's true.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.480]   It's just about credible.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   You kind of got to wait for it.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   What's the preponderance?
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   I caught that guy's icon.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   I believe him.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   Look at him.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.080]   He's on Mac Ese with horns.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.000]   But no, but I mean, I don't know.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And again, I don't know.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.280]   I have not spent a lot of time with this.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.840]   But I think part of the frustration I'm hearing is people saying, well, there's things in
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   here.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.320]   These are versions that you can't upgrade.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.120]   In some cases, they're sort of, I don't know what the phrase for that would be.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.760]   But there's not necessarily full versions.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.040]   The developers, I guess because they get such a small amount of money often.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.480]   They want to make money on the upgrades.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.480]   Right.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.520]   Often don't give you, you know, one of those versions that you can always upgrade for free.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.480]   So you might only get this current version, that kind of thing.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   But even then, I think it's a pretty good deal.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   You know, I'm conflicted.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.120]   Gruber is the one who doesn't, who first said, hey, this is a ripoff for the developers.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.160]   But I got to point out, the developers participate.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   Right.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.160]   Exactly.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.800]   And just downloading stuff they found on the internet, then, you know, and then let the
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   chips fall where they may.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.400]   They read a contract, they sign a contract.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.880]   I think the first time around, you could legitimately point out, look, they had no idea
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.400]   how much money was going to be involved.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.160]   I mean, it's millions of dollars for each bundle.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.760]   And so maybe they made a bad deal.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.680]   But this is the second time around now, guys.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.520]   It'd be worth having a couple of folks on either side.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.040]   It might be interesting to speak to them.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   I'm at this point.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   It's 49 bucks.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.240]   Only one more day as we record this, you have till Wednesday, the 23rd to do this, they
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:21.240]   just threw in vector designer, which by itself is 70 bucks.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.240]   Pixelmators in there, that's 59.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.240]   CSS at it.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.680]   We've talked about it from a four from Mac Rabbit.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.720]   One password, which you were singing the praises of Merlin and I have.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.920]   There's, you know, Chaching, we've talked about, we've talked with them.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.440]   In fact, we should get the Chaching guys on and say, why are you participating in this?
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   What do you get out of it?
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.880]   I mean, obviously there's a certain element of getting exposure out of it, but it's funny.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.120]   I just, Twitter, it's something not long ago about the value in your life of trying to
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.000]   rid yourself of all of your clients who buy on price and how much better your life gets.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.440]   I think one problem is that- That's a good exposure.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.520]   Well, with that exposure, you bring in a lot of people who are buying on price.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.000]   And if you're somebody like a, I don't know, like a buzzy Anderson, like who has this insanely
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.400]   great application that he's out there selling for like, I think his iPod program is like
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.640]   eight bucks, you know?
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.960]   And then you have the support that goes along with that.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   Again, I don't know.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.600]   I mean, there's two sides to every story, but it's definitely, I don't know.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.520]   I really wonder, I wonder what the post-script is on this for the developers.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.840]   I would love to hear their post-mortem.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.040]   And, you know, I have to say, I've purchased, and I usually do purchase almost always purchase
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   shareware.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.560]   I really love the Mac shareware community and they deserve the money.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.880]   And so I've purchased a lot of these programs already and even so, it seems like, boy, you
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.880]   know, if pixel made, I'll give you-
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.880]   But it's in a way, it's-
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.480]   It's a little bit like, you know, there's this wonderful story I want to say in the Atlantic
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.720]   a few years ago about how Walmart deals with its suppliers.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.800]   And I don't mean to say, Mac Heist is the same.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.880]   Yeah, they have no leverage with these guys, they're not-
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.360]   Well, yeah, I mean, they're able to go in and make Levi's come up with an entire line
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.880]   of clothing just for Walmart.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.600]   They're able to, Vlasic, a company that's spent 30 years trying to build a brand around
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.120]   people getting people to buy on quality, forces them to put out a five gallon barrel
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.160]   of pickles for $3 or whatever.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.040]   So I mean, there's definitely market forces here.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.360]   I think it's a very lively discussion and it would be definitely be interesting to hear
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360]   both sides.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   But there's also, I should say that I, one of the people who's in the cab with me is actually
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.920]   up on iChat and I've just pinged him to see if he-
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   Good.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920]   Come on.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.920]   He's on, he's- he's- he's- he's- he's- he's- he's- he's- he's- he's- he's- he's- he's- he's
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   on the phone standby so that could be three minutes, it could be 30.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   We'll see, we'll- we'll leave that as the lead that- that gets people to keep listening
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   to the podcast.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   I'll tell you about it.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.760]   Andy, I'm gonna chat, uh, send you the phone number that he can call him to join us at
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   any time.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.760]   Okay.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   I'll send that to you in chat right now and-
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   Blue.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.120]   And that way if he wants to join us he can.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.560]   And I, you know, if he wants to be anonymous he can.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.320]   Although I'd prefer it obviously if he'd say who he is.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.560]   But yeah, I'd love to hear what's wrong with this and why I shouldn't go plunked at my
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   name.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   I think that is.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   I'd like to hear what that person has to say.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.440]   But the- the- well, while we're waiting for that, there's a- there's something that's
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.880]   kind of, not not unpleasant but sometimes uncomfortable that we have to really acknowledge
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.880]   that.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.280]   And that- and Merlin, that's a great analogy you meant.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.040]   You made bringing up Walmart.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   We don't like Walmart.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.160]   We think that they- we often think that they do terrible things especially for the labor
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.940]   situation in this country.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.760]   But you can't deny that there are great many people for whom saving $3 on a pack of tube
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.880]   socks is a really big and important deal.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.760]   For the same reason, there are a whole bunch of people that would not be able to use apps
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.880]   of this caliber if not for the fact that companies like Mac Heist are making them available
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.480]   in these really, really affordable packages.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.560]   So while I really, really want every developer to be able to put three kids through college
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.280]   based just on the fees that they're getting through their self-published software, I can't
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:48.000]   bring myself to say that unless they're- unless Mac Heist is being deliberately deceptive
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.520]   and unethical in how they pay out to their developers, I can't bring myself to tell people
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.840]   not to buy this package.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   Right.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.840]   No.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.840]   I mean, I think that's a good idea.

[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.840]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   I think that our standard, like preferences, like keychain, I use .Mac to sync.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   Then I'll move the applications over that I want or reinstall the applications I want.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.840]   Do you remember your frustration with, I think it was about a year or so ago?
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   You had that frustration with de-registering one of your Macs on iTunes by the Mac.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   You didn't need more.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   I guess I just wonder, I know this sounds neat.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   This is the squirrelliest part of it I understand.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   I realize that the studios would freak if .Mac ever officially was hosting files, media files,
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   media files for you.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   But just think about that.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840]   Just think about it.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   If all your stuff is up in the cloud, look at the direction of things like smart folders.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   Think about Time Machine.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840]   What is Time Machine doing, basically?
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   Time Machine is saying, "Look, I'm going to take care of all this for you.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.840]   You don't need to worry about where it goes.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   I'm going to take care of this now, especially with Time capsule."
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   I just feel like these all kind of hint at this direction, the truly disruptive thing that
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.840]   they could do right now is not to make smaller laptops or not to make bigger iPhones.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   Make it better than that.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.840]   But to basically become your one-stop shop for your entire electronic world.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.480]   Well, in a way, that's where they're going with iTunes.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.720]   That's where they're going with Apple TV.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.320]   I think that makes perfect sense.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.840]   In fact, I guess the real question is why they haven't done it sooner with .Mac.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.840]   Is that making sense?
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   Is that crazy talk?
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.680]   .Mac definitely is the great unexploited resource at Apple.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:30.440]   And I also think the great unexploited resource of users, there's just so much potential there.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:37.520]   I've always thought that .Mac could work as the ultimate glue that finally makes your
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.920]   physical location and the actual computer sitting behind completely irrelevant.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.960]   Maybe it's just harder to do than we realize.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.480]   I mean, look, they're trying with back to my Mac and things like that.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.000]   Well, it's not all that hard.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.840]   I mean, I'm already doing stuff just with automated actions that exploits .Mac in ways
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.240]   that really should be a menu item in the Finder.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.400]   It should be a lot easier to simply say.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.720]   You can do this stuff right now with unison or you can do this with especially unison.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   What's your saying?
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.760]   Unison is a syncing program that will also run deaths on text.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   And so basically, you can't unisons in saying not to be confused with Panic.com's unison,
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.800]   but unison is my syncing tool of choice.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   Is this a Unix tool that's supported?
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   You run it.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   It's panic makes it.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   No, no, no.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   Okay.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   I see that's what I'm not.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:30.360]   You can shell, you can like SSH into your server where the kind of the where it lives
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.080]   and say basically run this between these two like home directories.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.760]   And you know, obviously the first one takes a while, but after that, that's what I'm getting
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.760]   at though.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.760]   Any of this stuff with Mozy, with Time Machine with any of that stuff, once you get over
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.000]   the hump with that first sync, it's really trivial to keep differences from it.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.400]   Because you're just syncing changes.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   Exactly.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.440]   And you add into the mix the ability to say like, oh, you know, for wherever I am in my
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.680]   motel, I want to go plug in and give me a fresh mix on my shuffle.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.400]   And and and I added that the ability of like you no longer have these issues of what happens
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.360]   when you lose a computer with all your stuff on it.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.600]   You get a super strong password and throw it on this in the cloud repository.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.480]   And kind of then imagine, imagine that partnering with Google and using Google's applications
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.520]   as the online tool from running all that stuff.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.000]   And all of a sudden Microsoft has a really serious competitor on their hands.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Just toss it out.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I agree with you.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I agree.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.240]   Google wants to lead the platform in that sort of a direction.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:31.200]   But when you because they're there, they're, they're, MO has always been real tactile like
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.640]   features that when somebody sits down behind a Macintosh, they appreciate that there's this
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.440]   thing they can do on this Macintosh.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.880]   They can't do on other machines.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.960]   And when I think about that, I think about things like, you know, you start up a, you
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.760]   have more than one Macintosh and you launch mail for the first time mail.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.680]   The first thing you did when you set up, when you install the O.S. was tell it what
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.800]   your, what your Mac addresses and magically mail has configured itself because it knows
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.760]   what all your email addresses are.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.000]   It knows what all your I check client, I'll, excuse me, I chat pals are knows, well, your
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.440]   address book stuff are right now we can do it in the sense of it'll just simply use,
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.280]   recent information down from dot Mac.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.400]   But what I'm getting at is the ability to simply drop by any single Macintosh anywhere
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.680]   in the world and just by virtue of the fact that it knows that I have this dot Mac account,
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.400]   it can instantly transform any Mac I'm sitting behind into my home Mac.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   Exactly.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.400]   And they have that capability.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.400]   I mean, they've been doing that for years with school systems.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.520]   So that capability is already there with Mac server.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.120]   Well, I think that I think the one thing that's going to be kind of necessary is to either
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.840]   beef up the, the encryption that's on that volume or at least make it more apparent how
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.560]   secure that system is.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.560]   I'm still very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.840]   never really said it's, it's always been, I believe that the truth of them, of the matter
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.720]   is that it is a simple case of you have that one password.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.280]   And if someone guesses that password, you're kind of hosed.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.600]   It's as strong as Apache, right?
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.920]   I mean, it's just the access, right?
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   It's as strong as that.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.880]   It's still there's always that upper, there's always that, that hard limit as to what I'm
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.360]   willing to put up on my dot Mac.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:12.120]   I'm also at, at this point, I'm getting more and more concerned that I have one dot, I
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.720]   have one Apple ID password.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.360]   And if someone knows what it is, they can get it all the files on my dot Mac.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.840]   They can purchase $100 worth of stuff on the iTunes store, on the Apple store.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.000]   I would like to see different levels of secure, of password security.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.560]   If that were to happen, I would probably be exploiting dot Mac a lot more.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:34.400]   As it is, I have created an, you know, not the, the day regu, uh, on-meter action that
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.360]   says, look, if you, if I've touched this file in the past two, two days, please upload it
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.880]   to dot Mac so that I can get it if things go badly.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.160]   So you do that in lieu of the dot Mac local drive setup.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.480]   How do you mean?
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.600]   Well, you can create an iDISC that's local.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.520]   And then if you have that iDISC, you have automatic sync.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.520]   That's what I've been doing.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.520]   That's what I do.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.120]   It takes 10 gigs on your hard drive, but.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   Right.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   Sorry.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.120]   That's what I meant.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:11.840]   I also, uh, I, I have that plus I have a CD sized, uh, secure, dist, um, disc image that
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.120]   I move back and forth.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.680]   It's not so much that it's a better solution that it's a solution that I understand.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.280]   I understand that this is encrypted with really great protection.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.480]   I've got a really great 24 character password on it.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.760]   And even someone does have my dot Mac password and they download this disc image.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.760]   At least that's unless, you know, unless they have, they have access to a trillion dollar
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.960]   budget in the United States army, they're probably not going to be able to break it.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.560]   So I say, I think we're using dot Mac.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.400]   I think we're getting our value out of dot Mac.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.720]   I think anybody who has more than one Mac, uh, just for the sinking and the iDISC alone,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.040]   I think dot Mac is worth the 80 or 90 bucks.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.040]   It seems so interesting.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.680]   No, they put so much care and sense of finish into what they do.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.640]   And that sounds Leo, it sounds like you're not having the same problems.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.040]   I am, but I can tell you from just the responses I get on Twitter and from my blog that there's
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.240]   a lot of pain out there.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.200]   Sinking is always a mess.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   Sinking is always a mess.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.920]   And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.840]   I've been lucky.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.880]   But you know, anytime you sink, you always have issues.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.720]   I free what I'll, what I do regularly is I make copies of my address book, my iCal,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.480]   you know, local backup copies.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.360]   And I do reset maybe, you know, monthly off to do a reset because something got out of
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.360]   sync.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.200]   But as long as you have those local copies, the reset seems to work pretty well.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.480]   I mean, I, I haven't lost any data.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.200]   Let's put it that way.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.440]   Anyway, that's good.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.680]   So a call for Apple to, to, to, to, to, to,
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.680]   that's a production.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.680]   Let's put that down.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   Let's put that down.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.560]   It's not going to be my squarely prediction is eventually the contents of your Mac will
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560]   live on.Mac.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.840]   I want to, I want that on the record.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.320]   You know, you need better broadband to do it, frankly.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   Let's face it.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   For sinking.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   You think including, just for sinking?
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.120]   Well, not the, not the, not the diff based sinking you're talking about.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:52.080]   But when you're talking about your, your home, you could go to any Mac, log in and your home
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.680]   directory appears there.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.040]   That's 10 or more gigabytes, probably more.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.280]   That has to kind of be available to you in almost real time.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.840]   You need a high speed can, a very good high speed can.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.320]   I don't think you'd be running it off that server.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.600]   But I mean, running diffs on that, if you're using unison, you can see like running diffs
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   on stuff like that is not.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.040]   Oh, I thought you wanted it to be, I thought you wanted to be able to use any Mac.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.040]   That's the idea of it.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   So imagine that becomes the master copy that lives on.Mac.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.680]   And then the slaves are on all of your different Macs.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.040]   When you log in, you automatically in the background every night or whatever.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   I misunderstood.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.960]   I thought you wanted this capability, which again, Apple server does offer.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960]   Oh, it's done server does.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.960]   Oh, sure.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.200]   To log in to any Mac and boom, it's your Mac.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.560]   I don't want that one to my prediction.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.560]   Now I'm going to take that out of the profession.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   I want that.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   I like that.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.320]   Then you can use anybody's Mac book air and all of a sudden.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.920]   Doesn't the Mac book air with a fresh account suddenly start making a lot of more sense?
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.800]   Because think about what you just described Leo.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.120]   You log into somebody's machine.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.440]   They make a new account, right?
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.240]   You go in, you make a password, you identify what your dot Mac information is.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   And it's all right.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.240]   You go out to lunch and when you come back, everything at like Teal the library that's
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.640]   super important, everything at two has been like 10, 10 gigs isn't everything I've got.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.840]   It's not all my photos, obviously.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.240]   It's not my iTunes library, but it's enough that everything I really need is there.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.600]   That's how I use it.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.960]   Every time I buy a new power book, I copy my documents folder from the old one to the
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   new one.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.520]   I've done this from Lilith number one, my power, my power brick 100 all the way to the
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.680]   very latest one.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.920]   And even so, we're talking about less than six gigabytes of documents.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.920]   Exactly.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.160]   That picture is not music, but in terms of document.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.480]   The stuff that I would really, really, really be hitting the vodka if I ever lost it for
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.480]   good.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:38.600]   If I got a load of, if I got rid of downloads, iTunes, meaning movies, video videos, and
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.920]   if I got rid of that and I got rid of photos, I got 34 gigs of photos.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   You know what?
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.920]   I can kill you.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   It's keynote.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.920]   keynote can kill you.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920]   One keynote.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   Oh, is that right?
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   Because it's really, it's a, it's a, it stores all the media in there.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   It's a folder.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.520]   I'd love to save that, but I don't save the keynotes for that reason.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.480]   I mean, wouldn't it be nice, Andy, if you had put all your presentations on your eye
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.480]   disc?
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.360]   What about for the, what about for the Leel support library?
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.080]   They're going to have a Yale Sunday.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.320]   What I'm sending you on.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.280]   I send you a regular DVDs with the latest.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   So they have everything.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.520]   As it's my belief that I really can make a nice result.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.320]   I drive that anyone can ever require.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   Say, Mr. Leport.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.600]   Next time, please put it on a DVD, RW, so that we can reuse the DVD.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.600]   Thank you.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.560]   We have a coffee table already.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.560]   Please.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.280]   So, Andy, you had some things you wanted to talk about.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.600]   You know, when we started this before we went on, on air, I said, this is going to be
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.880]   the silliest Mac break week ever because we have nothing to talk about.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.320]   But apparently, yeah, that's wrong.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.920]   That's always, that's always a bad boast to make because if you're looking for the silliest
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   Mac break we've ever done, that's an awfully high bar.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.800]   Plus, we're just coming back from a week.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   You have travel.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   We just don't have enough enough.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   Hey, I see.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.640]   You don't want to dare us without it.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.400]   Let me see if we can get Scott born on there.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.400]   No.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.600]   Scott born on briefly and now he's gone again.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.040]   Hey, so, but you did have some things you wanted to talk about guys.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   I mean, I'm not.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.320]   I mean, there's now someone, I read her email me just today with an observation about the
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:09.160]   MacBook Air saying that he sees it not so much as a MacBook, so much as a transitional
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:14.400]   device towards that big, wonderful iPhone tablet and these other cool things that might
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.440]   be in the offing in the future.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:21.280]   And I had to, it was a wonderfully, my reply was a wonderfully practiced mix of humility,
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:27.520]   appreciation and arrogance by which I said, I think I missed that.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.720]   My reply was, I think you're totally and completely wrong, but you've given me a great
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:36.360]   idea because because as I'm sitting there in the keynote, I'm thinking, my God, they
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:41.160]   actually convinced Intel, which is like the, which is like the main, the company that
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.400]   manufactures clean water for the entire planet and they decided, you know, you know, this
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.080]   H2O that you're making for us is kind of chunky.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.920]   Could you make us a water molecule that's half as big?
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   And Intel said, sure.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.080]   Is it a special chip on there?
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.080]   Is it something special?
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.880]   It's the exact same chip only a package that's much, much, much smaller.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.720]   Oh, so they did make it a special dip for it.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   Right.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.200]   And so what it made and so I was wondering, well, geez, that was a, that's a really big
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.920]   deal for them to do that, especially for a product that's going to be that sort of, it's
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.480]   a good niche, but sort of, but it's sort of iffy.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.080]   I mean, it's, it might, it has a potential being one of those things that does okay for
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.200]   about a year and that sort of trickles out.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.640]   What this email made me think is that, well, what if Apple told Intel that, look, we can't
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.000]   tell you what we're planning, but we're going to need a whole bunch of really small versions
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.440]   of this chip.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.600]   We need to build a whole bunch of machines that have the power of a MacBook, but need,
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.880]   but need to be fit and tiny, tiny, tiny little packages like tablets, like half tablets,
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.920]   like all these other small packages.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.640]   And you think about all the things that we've been fantasizing about that might be coming
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:51.880]   out in 2008, 2009, 2010, like in these entirely new classes of multi touch devices, and you
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.000]   start thinking about, well, what would be required in order to pull that off?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.120]   One of them would be smaller, lower heat, lower package CPUs.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.360]   So your conspiracy theory is the reason Intel went along with this is this is just the first
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.400]   of a whole new product line from app.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:11.160]   I think that so much of what's required when you're trying to speculate about these things
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:16.480]   is not only the aforementioned fit the vodka, but also trying to try to realize that you
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.280]   can't just sit down in front of a whiteboard and build the entire world that you need in
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.760]   order to make this product happen.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.080]   You have to do things in increments.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.840]   And one of them is once again, if you need a small microprocessor that has the power
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.560]   of a desktop processor, you can't just simply special order that when the time comes.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.960]   You need to build the infrastructure so that these are rolling off the assembly lines.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.080]   So this becomes a stock product when the time comes.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:43.160]   Similarly, you cannot start writing a brand new development system for this unseen device.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:47.800]   You can't really can't expect to get real production on that kind of a software, especially
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.440]   if you're trying to teach an entire community of developers to start all over again.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.360]   You need to lay the groundwork for that quickly.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.680]   And that's like I've said before, that's what I see this the iPhone software development
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   kit coming in.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:04.120]   So you may get your 10 or 12 inch MacBook just with more of an iPhone feel to it.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.720]   I wouldn't mind that so much.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   No.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.320]   I think I mentioned this last week, but I don't know if anybody's got any further information.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.520]   The touch capabilities of that touchpad, is that a hardware feature or something that
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.360]   could be extended to other computers in software?
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.800]   My understanding is that it is a hardware feature that you can't simply do a firmware
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.160]   update and suddenly my G4 power book can handle multi-touch.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.240]   Now I have to say that gives us I think 90% of what I would like with it.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.440]   I mean, we don't need to have the touch screen if I could do it on the pad.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   Do you agree?
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.680]   I think the whole touch screen thing is I don't know.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.240]   Again, I wouldn't finger print.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240]   Really?
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.320]   Yeah, I wouldn't be really surprised if I saw it.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.160]   But at the same time, that's I don't know because then that also you then you knowing
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:56.480]   how Mac developers are and how just the whole Apple culture is.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.720]   That's a sea change in how you use an application.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.240]   I mean, you know, to just put something onto a touch screen and think you're going to use
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.560]   it in that same way.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.160]   And I'll just just think about the pattern that that causes you to use.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   If you're like me and you got this big ass now monitor sitting in front of you and you
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.520]   use your desk in a certain way that really unless they really do get into the whole syncable,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.320]   you know, put your I'm back into the slot thing, I don't know.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.320]   I don't see it.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.520]   I don't really don't see it.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.200]   Well, also it has to be implemented.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:28.160]   I mean, as far as I could tell, it was only I photo that could see these gestures, right?
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.120]   Yeah, but it's something.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.360]   And I did ask those specific questions.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:38.080]   Unfortunately, there were a bunch of questions I asked during my briefing and this isn't
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   a group briefing.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.920]   This is like me and one guy that the answer was we're not prepared to talk about that
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.800]   or when we get back to you on that.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.960]   One of them was that there is a question about exactly how these multi touch gestures
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.240]   are being implemented.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.040]   It is not a it is not a system by which magically Microsoft word or whatever app you're using
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.520]   right now to understand these gestures.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.440]   It's not like there's something that translates immediately that there that he told me that
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.720]   there is an OS level mojo and then there is an API level mojo.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.600]   But you have right in the apps to the API.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   I don't know.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.200]   Like, do you remember like when I mean, there's all those little kind of kernel extension
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.320]   things out there that we had cheese?
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.040]   Yeah, that'll let you turn your regular old touchpad into like the scrolling kind and
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.040]   stuff like that.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.560]   You think it would really take different hardware in order to do that?
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.920]   There's a difference between doing something and doing something to Apple standards.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.640]   There are a whole bunch of different third party utilities for adding gesture like interfaces,
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.800]   especially after the iPhone came out.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.520]   But a lot of them work kind of squirrely, especially when you talk about, again, we're
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:43.040]   all nerds, you know, the things that we have the amount of condiments, emollients and other
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.720]   things we have on our fingers, fingers as we're eating our lunch and trying to get a little
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:54.480]   work done will absolutely kneecap any software based solution for multi touch gestures.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:01.840]   And when you're considering that when you're entering commands by gesture, it misinterpreting
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.040]   a double swipe for a triple swipe can have really, really bad, really inconvenient consequences,
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   shall we say?
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.240]   So it's important for this thing to actually work.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   Yeah, sure.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.240]   All right.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   I do.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:18.160]   I do think I like the notion that this could be a bigger product line and could include
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.160]   touch in.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:24.440]   Oh, hey, I think we have a magic voice on the line with us right now.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:29.040]   Hey, Rich, good to talk to you, Rich is the man behind bare bone software.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:39.480]   Creators of course, text Wrangler, BB edit, Yo Jimbo and Andy Rodin a cab with you, Rich.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.320]   Hey, Rich.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.760]   Hi, that's Merlin man.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.760]   Hi, Marlon.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   Hi, Leo.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.760]   Hi, Andy, Mr. Segal.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.440]   So I'm looking at the Mac heist bundle thinking this is great.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.760]   I remember the controversy last time.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:59.600]   And I remember, in fact, John Gruber saying, you know, these guys are making millions and
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.680]   sharing very little with the developers.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.840]   Why would anybody do this?
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.280]   Hey, it's a second time around.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.760]   Surely anybody doing it is going in with open eyes.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.160]   And I have to say from the point of view of a consumer, this bundle of what, you know,
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:19.840]   almost a dozen programs for 49 bucks, look, 14 for 49 bucks looks pretty good.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.200]   So what do you think as a developer?
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:30.240]   Well, as a developer, I would not participate in something like this.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.400]   I'll tell you why.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.440]   The first is that, yes, granted it's a terrific deal for consumers.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:45.280]   I think it's really hard, it's really, really difficult to argue with the appeal of buying
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.480]   a whole bunch of really great software at a simply amazing price if you compare against
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.280]   the individual purchase prices.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.960]   But as a developer, I see a few problems here.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.320]   One of them, and perhaps the one that really hits close to home for me because I'm still
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:10.360]   involved in a lot of the tech support for our product, is that if you acquire, you know,
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:17.600]   10,000 brand new customers as the result of something like this, you're then on the hook
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:23.640]   to support each and every one of them that happens to call an emperor for support.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:30.440]   And part of the purchase price of any piece of software, part of the magic, if you will,
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:35.720]   of pricing any piece of software is taking this sort of thing into account.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.440]   Offering tech support is part of the cost of doing business.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:44.000]   So if you don't factor that into the price of your software, you're going to find yourself
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.800]   taking a very long walk off of a very short peer business speaking.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:57.040]   So the moment a customer of a bundle calls in for support, you've lost anything you've
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:03.080]   made on that sale and actually a whole lot more.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.840]   Beyond that, there are a couple of other considerations.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.120]   Really mostly related to value.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:15.800]   The products that participate in these bundles are basically permanently devalued because
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:24.200]   now an expectation has been created that the product should always be this cheap.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.480]   Hey, you know, I've got it as part of the $50 bundle.
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.560]   So what, how much could it really be worth?
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   Right.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.800]   That's a good point.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:38.440]   And that makes it very difficult to make a real offering later on.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:43.000]   And I think that effect tends to bleed over into the rest of the marketplace.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.720]   And I think it ends up affecting developers who don't participate in these sorts of things
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.000]   as well, which is a little bit counterintuitive.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.280]   But I think nonetheless accurate, we've seen over the past couple of years a real change
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   in the way people look at the prices of their software and they seem to have an expectation
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:10.200]   of, you know, well, I could get this for effectively $2.50.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.000]   Why should I pay 30, 40, 50, however many dollars for it?
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.120]   So why would a developer participate in something like this?
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:25.000]   I think there are some arguments that sound good on the surface, but don't hold up the
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   scrutiny.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:34.040]   A couple of them that I've heard are that it builds brand awareness and generates buzz.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:40.960]   And that is true to a degree, but I have to wonder at what costs the buzz comes.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.160]   And especially when, you know, certain things happen and I'll get into that later maybe.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.720]   You know, things happen and all of a sudden you get associated with an effort which perhaps
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.840]   isn't universally respected.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.720]   And the next thing happens is you've been touched by them.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.920]   You can't quite recover.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:08.800]   Another argument I've heard is that, hey, you know, we'll sell an old unsupported version
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:14.000]   and we'll make back the money and upgrade revenue.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.080]   And I don't buy into that one either because what happens is you'll find at the end of
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.680]   the day that the crossover rate for upgrades is really pretty low.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.080]   And part of it has to do with the fact that customers who are willing to pay that little
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:35.520]   for your software in the first place are going to think extra carefully about spending five
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.640]   or ten times that amount of money for an upgrade because that's kind of what it works
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.640]   out to.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.760]   If the effective cost of your product was $2 and you asked $20 for an upgrade, they're
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.520]   going to say, well, wait a minute.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.480]   Those are really the two big ones that I've heard a lot of.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.800]   Now, see, I bought your Jimbo.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.120]   I bought BB Edit.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.120]   I spend money.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.640]   In fact, I bought half of these programs already anyway.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.800]   I believe in supporting the shareware community.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:11.600]   Should I avoid a bundle like this because it's bad for the community?
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.840]   I don't feel that I'm in a place where I can tell anybody what to do in this context.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:23.600]   All I can really ask is that you think about the implication and decide what is best for
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   you.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:29.880]   If the budgeting is such that this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to you
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:35.160]   and the other considerations aren't important, then go for it.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:41.880]   Personally, I would rather look at a piece of software in that bundle and say, okay,
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.120]   I want that piece of software and I'm going to make sure that I support the developer
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:51.040]   in the fullest possible fashion, which means in this case, making sure they get as much
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   of my money as possible.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   Of course, the developer in this case is obviously signed up.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:02.200]   I mean, it's not like they're being fooled into doing this, I don't think.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.240]   No, and that's an argument that I've heard as well, is that while the developer is going
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:13.400]   into this with open eyes and nobody's holding a gun to their head, nobody's lying to them,
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:21.560]   etc., etc., I accept that statement as fact, but I also think that in some cases, the
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.600]   developers are choosing to ignore the larger considerations.
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:31.360]   In other cases, the developers have made the larger consideration and decided that they're
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.360]   not important.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:38.440]   I think that either way it's a legitimate decision, whether or not I agree with it is,
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.200]   obviously a different matter.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:46.440]   It sounds to me, I'm not putting words in your mouth, I'm just going for my own take,
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   the way that I personally would justify this package is that it gives a user a way to legitimately
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:57.720]   acquire a whole bunch of really good software and hopefully later, I'm sure this wouldn't
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:02.880]   actually be communicated, but for my point of view, if there's specific software in these
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.560]   packages that I absolutely adore and rely on day in and day out, but I might be motivated
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:14.080]   to then make sure that I buy another copy of this either through upgrade or at some later
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:18.560]   point directly through the manufacturer so that the loyalty that they bought by giving
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:24.600]   me such a deal on this version gets paid off down the line with better terms.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:32.320]   I think that's a valid argument, Andy, but I also think that in the larger sense, except
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:39.560]   for people like you and I who really do think that through, it rarely actually happens.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:46.200]   And it doesn't happen enough to offset the losses from people who simply ignore the other
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.800]   products in the bundles that aren't important to them or simply take advantage of having
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.920]   gotten a great price on multiple pieces of software.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:59.280]   I'd also like to go back to something that you said earlier about how if you, if your
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.560]   software product has been touched by a Mac heist in some way Mac heist's fingerprints
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.120]   will stick to you and that might not be something that you like, how would you equate that?
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:14.920]   Is it sort of like when, no matter how good that your hair care product is, once it's
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:19.160]   being hocked at an infomercial with David Hasselhoff, suddenly it seems like it's so
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:24.920]   much cheaper and todrier thing than it was before, or is it part of just the developer
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.600]   community understanding the sort of terms that you had to accept in order to sell your
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:37.160]   software that way, that gives you sort of little piece of rat hair on you.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:46.040]   I think that both sides of that equation couldn't have possibly been expressed any better Andy.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.280]   And I think that both of them to some degree are true.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:58.760]   I know that in the developer community, although individual developers are contractually forbidden
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:06.320]   to make the terms of their deals public, there's been a certain amount of sub-rosa discussion
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.680]   about the whole thing.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:15.320]   And I wouldn't say that developers resent other developers for having participated
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:20.120]   in Mac Heist, but it's the sort of thing that people notice in the community and they don't
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:24.080]   really forget.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.880]   And I think that sort of addresses the second part of your commentary.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:36.440]   You know, I am aware of some of the developers and products that participated in the current
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.120]   Mac Heist and the previous ones.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.680]   And I wouldn't say that I respect them any less.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:46.320]   I think the decision still for them to do so still sort of confound me.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:52.680]   But again, they made that decision and they're all grown up in just the way it used to go.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:58.520]   Not for me to say otherwise.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:06.200]   And so the first part, the sort of infomercial data half a half angle, I have to say yeah.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:14.520]   And to me, there's very much a lie down with dogs get up with fleas going on there.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:21.400]   The thing that's got this front most in my mind is that just before the announcement
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:30.680]   of the latest Mac Heist, this is toward the end of November of '07, there was a situation
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:40.240]   in which some fairly well known bloggers and news outlets, their sites were defaced by
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.800]   this anonymous hacker who went under the handle Malcor.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:51.800]   To make a long story short, it turned out that Malcor wasn't real.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:58.640]   The defacements were real but they were done with the knowledge and content of the bloggers
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.760]   and the news outlets involved.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.720]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:07.880]   Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.080]   To get publicity?
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   To get publicity.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.080]   Geez.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:18.400]   And at first they didn't, they didn't, I mean at first some of them, Chad, some of them
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.600]   right now said I've been hacked.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.160]   Now if you stop at that first step and think for a moment, let's say you're a blogger
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:34.200]   and you're hosted by media temple or expression engine or another hosting service whose business
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:40.400]   runs, I'm a secure hosting of blog and news sites.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:46.920]   Well if you're the provider of that hosting service, all kinds of alarm bells start going
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   off.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   Your customers start calling in panic.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:59.120]   Oh my God, somebody got these things, what's going to happen to me and that happened in
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.720]   a couple of cases.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:07.480]   And finally some rumors started going around that it was Mac Heifs that was behind the
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:13.520]   fake defaces that it was Mac Heifs that was behind the hook and sure enough that was the
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.520]   case.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:22.280]   And a couple of bloggers said yeah we're sorry we got caught.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:23.280]   It was a bad decision.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.840]   Well there's the percentage in it for the bloggers and for Mac Heifs.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.840]   I don't understand even what the point was.
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:34.080]   For the bloggers it's hard to say well no scratch that.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.480]   In terms of finance it's impossible for me to say I don't know if anybody took anybody
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.800]   who were paid to do it.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:47.280]   But you could certainly question that I really do not know and I don't want to speculate.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.840]   Obviously what happens is it generates buzz.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:57.760]   It generates buzz for the websites involved it generates buzz for Mac Heifs.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.160]   Well if nothing these Mac Heifs guys are good at marketing.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.160]   If nothing else.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.320]   I mean there's no question about that.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.320]   They've got us talking about them.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:14.240]   Indeed and what we're really talking about right now is what is if you will forgive me
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:19.160]   for saying it so bluntly frankly it's juvenile stuff.
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:27.000]   And this sort of thing drives reputable marketing and PR people absolutely up a tree.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.480]   Well get ready because there's going to be a lot more of it.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.120]   I mean I think that that's kind of the nature of the beast now.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.840]   It's the same thing journalists sometimes are driven crazy by the ethics of bloggers
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.080]   and podcasters.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:46.080]   So Rich if you've been around this business for a while now this is Merlin and if a young
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:51.800]   developer came to you and was looking at an opportunity to participate in a bundle what
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.000]   kind of advice would you give them?
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.200]   What kind of terms would you want to look for?
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.200]   What would you say?
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.160]   What kind of decision making goes into deciding whether to do it at all?
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:09.920]   I would say very carefully examine what you want to get out of it and I would be predisposed
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.520]   to say simply don't do it.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:18.120]   If you're a young developer and you've got a startup and you've got a new product the
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:22.920]   product is really going to fly or not on its own merit.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:31.040]   If you try to undercut your core message with pricing if you say hey look how cheap you
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.760]   can get this.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.560]   The message you're sending is really bad.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.920]   The message you're sending is I've got nothing really else to recommend my product with so
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.360]   I'm going to recommend it on price.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.440]   Yeah this is what it's worth.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:47.480]   Yeah and so if you've got a hot new idea and you think it's the greatest thing that's
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.640]   been sliced bread put it out there.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:57.680]   Pick a price for it that you believe the market will bear and that meets the intersection
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:03.800]   of what the market will bear and what can sustain you and your business and go for it.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:12.000]   I think that is really the best long term sustainable way to get a product out there
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.800]   and successful.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.760]   Rich I really want to thank you for joining us.
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.960]   I think you stated this so eloquently and so perfectly I don't think there's any question
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:26.880]   now in my mind about Mac Heist and whether I want to participate but I leave it to our
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.240]   listeners who are astute.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.880]   And Rich as one of the as the grand I hate to say it now the grand old men of Mac developers
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.600]   we're really glad we could get you on Mac break weekly.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:42.440]   Well thank you Lee and thank the rest of you guys and the listeners for giving me the
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.600]   time to answer these questions and express my views.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.800]   BearBones.com it's a place to get BB at it.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.640]   Yo Jimbo I just talked about how I used you a Jimbo all the time and text Wrangler thank
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.160]   you so much Rich.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:56.160]   Thank you Leo.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.480]   So I'm glad we could thank you for setting that up to Andy because I think that that
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.160]   was what he said it pretty clearly.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:06.240]   Yeah if I try to remember exactly how he said it I probably would have screwed it up and
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.760]   plus it's his words he has the right to say it not me.
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   And Rich is so respected in the Mac community I mean there's no he's been around from the
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.360]   beginning for one thing.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.520]   He's in the developer community he's the man with the point he had and he never argued
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.640]   with the man wearing the point he had so.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:29.240]   The one shirt from the 1990s that I have not allowed my wife to throw out it actually it
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:33.200]   went from having actually yellowed pits to actually like kind of forming some kind of
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.360]   a primordial crust.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.360]   Oh my god.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:41.720]   Is my original 1990 I want to say 1996 BB edit it doesn't suck t-shirt which I got for
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.000]   putting a badge on my website in about 1996.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.520]   And now there's some marketing for you you put up a badge you get a t-shirt it's pretty
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.520]   transparent.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.560]   Like Apple still uses BB edit to do their website as a matter of fact.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.520]   Oh god I know so many people who use it.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.520]   Oh yeah.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.760]   I go to NASA and I see oh you know the guy who does BB edit tell them to use the grip
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.760]   feature.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.320]   It is it's a great grip.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.320]   It's I show you I mean like you know I think I also I still think it would be really valuable
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.960]   to hear somebody on the other side of that who has a different take but that's it's
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.560]   this stuff is so complicated and it's really hard.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.840]   I just I don't think I bought Mac heist there was a bundle I bought not long ago it might
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.360]   have been there was another one they did it before Mac heist I got the one that had one
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.840]   password and it was a Mac heist.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.840]   Mac heist has done it twice now but there was another one before Mac heist and I can't
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:28.000]   remember for the wife anyway I so I might have I forget what I bought one of these not
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.880]   long ago but it's really it's really hard to to know this stuff and I think it's really
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:36.920]   valuable if you're somebody who really wants to see everybody get a fair shake I think it's
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.880]   worth hearing these these different points.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:43.240]   I know Philip Ryu Philip you're welcome to come on and talk about it if you want he's the
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:48.320]   guy behind Mac heist and behind that blogger scam.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.320]   I'd love to hear his response in particular to that I had not heard that.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:56.000]   Yeah I hadn't either I'm actually kind of shocked at that and some would say I'm sure
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.560]   Philip well hey it's a new world and this is guerrilla marketing.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:06.040]   I also would love to hear from any developer who has been part of Mac heist and what their
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.880]   experience has been.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.320]   Has it has been good for you would you do it again.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:16.880]   That's the best way for people to just email Leo at Leo.com and what next Mac Break Weekly
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.920]   is next Tuesday and we'll put you on we'll give you a chance to speak out I'm sure we
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:27.080]   won't hear from them all of them and maybe we'll get Gruber on too because he was the
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   guy who was I think started the original criticism.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.520]   He did a really extensive post with some pretty memory serves correct me on this one wrong
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.200]   but he did a post that was really deep on numbers.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.960]   Yeah he had numbers and would no one is it I mean I don't you know you're not allowed
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:46.160]   to talk about the numbers so I don't know I'm trying to remember what the original I do
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.720]   believe there was a bundle before they didn't come up with a bundle originally but it might
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:54.320]   have been the same group of guys I'm not sure.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.640]   Anyway I'm glad we could talk about that you guys have anything else you want to raise
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.640]   before we get to our picks of the week.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:07.160]   No I think that much like Steve Jobs and we managed to talk a whole lot about air today.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.080]   You know what good show.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.080]   Good show.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:16.120]   Some great some great topics I'm very happy and he but before we do our picks.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.280]   Let's do our audible pick.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   Our audible pick.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.400]   I do of course have an audible pick.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:28.920]   This is I love those those sort of books where if if you read it too early in your life you'll
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.480]   enjoy it and if you read it too late in your life you'll enjoy it but if you are exposed
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:39.320]   to this book at exactly the right time in your life it can materially change exactly
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:44.680]   all the choices that you make from that point onward and for me one of those books was Richard
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:50.200]   Feynman's the noble prize-winning physicist, a book of memoirs, Shirley you're joking Mr.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   Feynman.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:57.320]   Notes, the subtitle notes of a curious character and he had it and not only he was brilliant
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:02.920]   he was but it's not so much that he was he knew all about this physics stuff so much
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:10.720]   that he led his life with a spirit of adventure and wanting to try new things and wanted to
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:16.480]   have adventures that just about anyone can emulate and my god the adventures that he
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:21.480]   had he was his first big thing was he worked on the Manhattan Project but he was a young
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:26.760]   physicist at that time he was essentially the smart guy that some of you he was essentially
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.760]   the the the middle manager and Aaron boy who knew all about the physics so that if they
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:35.920]   sent him on an errand to check out a plant where they're refining uranium he's the guy
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.480]   who would understand exactly what the instructions are and find out if they were going well or
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:45.800]   not I will have to everyone who's read his books his memoirs this is the first of two
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.240]   or three I think that he wrote will be able to rattle off their favorite stories there
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.800]   are I it's me of one of my favorite stories I will rattle it off not to use well he's
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:57.400]   well as he as he did it himself so like I said he was like about 21 22 I'm not even
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:02.760]   sure he had his doctorate in physics yet but again he was he was so so whereas you know
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.640]   Niels Bohr and all those other big big big shot physicists were the people who were at
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.560]   the blackboard figuring out how to engineer the the the atomic bomb he was the guy that
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.400]   you know they could spare this guy to go out you know to to to the plant where they're
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:22.800]   finding the uranium and so because he's the guy who's from Los Al Los Al almost sent this
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.640]   physicist to check on the plant so they tend to treat him like a really big shot when he
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.520]   came to these places and so the at the plant they're really really proud of this brand
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.600]   new refinery that they were building to to to to refine this uranium and the whole point
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.640]   about this plan is that you can't allow too much of the stuff to cumulated one place at
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:44.120]   one time or else boom big explosion Chernobyl you can't have that happen and so at the end
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.680]   of the tour they think they already think he's a super genius and this is this is how he
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:53.760]   describes it in the memoir that he's not really all that smart but he has uncanny memory for
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.440]   remembering numbers and so he was able to pull off tricks like saying well geez back there
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:03.240]   when you're looking at that a sister in B B 12 you're talking about this so and so
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.960]   and they figured well jeez he can remember all these details like after only seeing it
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.600]   once he must be a super genius so they take him into this this room where they've got
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.560]   all the blueprints for the brand new wonderful new plant they're taking and it's a huge long
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.760]   table covered with stacks and stacks and stacks of blueprints and they want to impress on
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.400]   him how carefully they've engineered this building to move all the product throughout the plant
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:28.640]   so that you know safety is paramount that that no point at no point can to much too much
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.800]   of the stuff build up in one place they've got everything backed up with two different
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.000]   safety valves so that if one valve you know where to let go don't worry there's another
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.560]   safety valve in this place and so they're taking him through like the route that the
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.240]   stuff is going to be taking through the entire complex and it goes up to this pipe and goes
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.200]   into this building then through this wall and blah blah blah lifting up blueprints going
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.200]   from sheet to sheet to sheet and what they don't know and this is this it's all written
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.360]   the first person what what I should have told them early on was that I have no idea how
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.840]   to read blueprints and I'm getting more and more lost as this demonstration is going onward
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.800]   and onward and onward but I know that I'm totally screwed here because it would have
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.160]   been okay to say the very beginning I'm sorry I don't understand blueprints but at this point
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.240]   they'd look at each other and say well why did you have us go for 20 minutes displaying
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.640]   things you didn't understand so so I came up so I got this idea that there's this little
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:22.280]   symbol that I see I think it's the symbol for window that you know is all over the place
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.160]   and if I figure that if I know what the symbol for window is at least I'll be able to orient
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.480]   myself I'll know like where the walls are you know where the external walls are and so they're
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.160]   talking about you know the valve system so I randomly put my finger down on one of these
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:39.160]   little window symbols and say oh what happens if this valve right here gets stuck and expecting
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.280]   them to say oh no I'm sorry that's that's that's that must be a blurb on the on the
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.360]   blueprint that's not a that's not a valve that's a window but instead they too they look they
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.960]   they too tell me well sir if this valve gets stuck and it goes all the way through tracing
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.600]   the root tracing through to stop up the stack down this back and then suddenly they look
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:01.600]   at each other with experience this this expression of like stun goldfish and say oh my god you're
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:07.080]   absolutely right sir because just at random he picked out the one valve that if it had
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.880]   failed it would have blown up the entire plan but it was totally chauncey gardener like
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.920]   he just exactly and it's not that it's not that he's you know he has a third grade education
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.200]   he just fakes his way through his entire career but these are the stories stories he tells
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.960]   he tells a story about after the bomb and he's helping out you know writing up all the
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.600]   papers and explaining how it works that he had to learn how to be a safe cracker to to
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:35.600]   get at certain documents and adventures and being a being a professor in Brazil the effects
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:41.680]   of winning the Nobel Prize him even moments like him suffering burnout after Los Alamos
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.480]   when he was now just a regular professor Cornell and he lost all of his he lost all of his
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.960]   joy for physics and how he regained his joy I read this book when I was 17 or 18 and once
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.560]   again it really does give you the confidence at that age to realize that you know we're
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.200]   all freaks in certain areas and we're all think that we're good at some things but we
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.080]   have to have humility and other things and if you just leave yourself open to certain
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:08.920]   experiences and remind yourself that this is a world of joy and adventure and you just
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:14.520]   have to appreciate accept that in your life it will be a template for a lot of great experiences
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.720]   in your life I only wish that the if I think there's still a site where you can actually
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.600]   buy these stories read by Feynman himself it's so great I just love exactly I mean it's
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:31.720]   this Brooklyn dead end kid voice that is one of the most important physicists of the 20th
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:37.720]   century but this one is read by some guy named Raymond Todd but it is on a bridge and on
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.640]   that basis I can't imagine it being anything less than wonderful well and the really good
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:47.760]   news I'm very pleased to see his audible has all of the Feynman lectures available so
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.360]   you can get six easy pieces six not so easy pieces and then the individual lecture so
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.840]   I think from the red book so if you if you want to hear Feynman in his own voice you've
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:03.560]   got to be a physics fanatic to listen to these because they're serious physics but after you
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:09.200]   read the the fun easygoing light Feynman books like the pleasure of finding things out and
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.600]   of course you're picturately you're joking mr Feynman you can actually hear his voice
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.840]   on these other lectures I'm really this is it must be something new because I had looked
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:21.280]   before for the lectures and I had him on cassette I'm so glad that they've offering
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.080]   him now that's great yeah yeah he's just the greatest six easy pieces also six not so
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:32.400]   easy pieces and then the I think it's 20 something volumes of the Feynman lectures absolutely
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:39.160]   and I've I've just checked out and if you go to Feynman.com I don't believe they have
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.280]   the CDs but they have other other information about Feynman his later adventures and if
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:49.480]   you haven't in any in any group in which at least three people have at least four microprocessors
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.880]   on their body bodies just just mention the word Richard Feynman and you will get oh my
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.880]   god then he has then when he was on the the the the Challenger shuttle just asked that's
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:03.840]   right he he was actually already dying of cancer at the time and he chaired the the
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:09.080]   Challenger investigative committee and figured out what happened well I won't give anything
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.880]   away but that's that in itself is a great story he's the way he's the guy who who did
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.520]   the big demonstration that sort of shed the light of the thing but then in the book he
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:20.160]   explains well I didn't realize till later on that I was being manipulated by some guy
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:25.600]   oh it's great to know that even in the 60s even when he is the legendary Richard Feynman
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.400]   he still is the that humility to realize that oh maybe I'm not as smart as I thought I was
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.400]   after all fantastic.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.400]   Fantastic.

[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:04.200]   to see the depth of the Feynman material they've got online here this is really I now have
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.520]   a listening for years to come there's quite a bit of stuff on here.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.400]   That's a big part of what I like about audible and that you get to rediscover all these books

[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.640]   And now Andy unless you want to rest your voice a little bit I'll ask you for your software
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.720]   pick or hardware pick.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.520]   Software pick I'm sure there are at least two I've got a long list that I could use from
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:51.960]   Mackerel last week but I think that at least a couple of them are already you know you
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:57.560]   were Merlin have already chambered it and have the hammer back and really the place to
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:02.320]   be at Mackerel Expo last year was the butt end of Apple behind the apple booth was a whole
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:08.800]   bunch of little tiny town tiny town you could for for a small amount of money as a developer
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.240]   you could buy one square meter of space literally and that's where and that's where some of
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.960]   the most awesome stuff was I'm going to choose one that I'm sure you're not going to hope
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:24.600]   you're not going to pick it's a little app called tubal T O O B L T O O B L E and you can
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:30.920]   find you can download it's a free app you can download it from tubal.tv it is the first
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:39.320]   YouTube download utility that I've liked enough to actually recommend in my you do
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:49.120]   Mesotonic see you'll always get our attention on this show if you talk about YouTube.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.520]   This is cool in both of in both my books I mentioned tools for downloading you're not
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.800]   supposed to be able to download stuff off of YouTube there are tricks to get around it
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.360]   and I mentioned them there are also utilities that pur that purport to be able to do this
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.480]   but either they do it in a very very lame way or you know YouTube changes a semicolon
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.440]   at some point and the two and the tool becomes worthless this is a really great one stop
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:16.480]   shopping utility that you launch the application it does require that you download a little
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:23.240]   helper program it's a freeware app called Perion that gives yeah that gives it the
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.280]   app you should have it anyway it's gives the it gives a has a whole bunch of different
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.920]   file formats to quick time but once you do it you get a one window browser that you
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.080]   can search for YouTube videos click on any videos you like just click on download every
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:39.400]   whether it's one video or a hundred it'll download all these videos convert them into
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.000]   quick time and then add them add them to your quick time library obviously there's some
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.240]   loss in quality because you're taking a compressed thing and turning it into another compressed
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.720]   format but it's quick it actually works now that you to now the google has locked down
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:59.480]   the API for the for YouTube there's very little chance of this app will stop working
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:06.000]   the coolest thing is that it's being done by a couple of now when I say kids I'm talking
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.520]   about grown adults grown adults who cannot buy beer yet probably or can buy beer yet
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.440]   but can't do so legally and there of course they have a business plan and everything tuba
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.440]   is absolutely free free free it's not share where anything like that their plan is to
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:23.560]   do kind of like what the ice quit guys did which is to give away the basic app for free
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:28.560]   and then once they've developed fans to roll out a better version alongside it that will
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.000]   cost money if people want to buy it but this is there's nothing hacked down or limited
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.640]   about tuba lases I've been using it I downloaded for the first time friday night and I've been
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.880]   I've been using it pretty much every day since we really is quite slow is it to google video
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.960]   it is just for YouTube as far as I know it you there is a box where you can enter URL
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:54.240]   I don't know let me try that right now I'm gonna go into Google video that's always
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.360]   the thing is the nice thing about Google video for what they allow much longer movies so
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:05.520]   I was able to just for educational purposes pulled out a copy of horse feathers cool
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:13.120]   oh great I'm on video Google dot com I'm skipping past six different Martin Luther King
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.760]   I have a dream speech is to get the Bud Light Saucers commercial how there you go that's
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.960]   keep it just good you're not ready for president Andy that's all I've gone through I cannot
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.800]   tell you how many of these I have gone through I think at least three of them have probably
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.240]   been features on here let's just look quickly we've got to TV we've got tube sock we've got
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:35.440]   tube sock motor and the latest one I've used is called a video box which will basically
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:40.560]   if I can just heist your feature here Andy you basically you leave this app open and
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:47.760]   anytime Safari who find this FLV on the page it'll start it'll start queuing it over in
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.880]   this app and then you go and say okay well here's all things I've queued give me this
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.320]   one this one this one this one that's correct and then it grabs them all it's not grabbing
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   them at a very large size so I mean I think there's one room for somebody to dominate
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.160]   this my favorite my favorite tool outside of this and by the way it would seem as though
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.400]   it did not like the the Google video URL just didn't do anything about that but my generalized
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:14.160]   internet video tool is and actually a website called keep vid keep vid.com you just paste
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:19.120]   one out exactly paste any URL into the little web app it will get click on a button it will
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.280]   give you a URL you can download the flash video file from and then convert it using whatever
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:29.200]   tool you got handy like I squint it supports like two dozen three dozen different video sites but
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.280]   if you're gonna you're gonna pay for share where this year paying at the upgrade to visual hub
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.920]   from iSquint because it totally kicks but yeah that's an awesome awesome amazing app I mean if
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.800]   you're doing the kind of stuff we're talking about here now the raw kind of
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.800]   pissing from the high ground about all the developer rights mind if we tell you a couple
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.360]   ways to get some media free programs there you go free free free video
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:55.520]   which leads to which leads to the internet all right thank you Andy you know
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:01.360]   open source free software good news software it all gets a bad rap for me and so but ugly
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:07.040]   which is usually very well earned and don't start Andy I'm not there yet there is an application
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:13.360]   called have we talked about transmission transmission transmission at transmission bt.com
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.480]   this is a bit a bit torrent application that according to their about page works on five
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.920]   operating systems now you're thinking to yourself i'm going to open this thing up and it's going
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.840]   to be some kind of crazy Java swing thing and it's going to make my eyes heard and it's going to
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:31.920]   look like old mozilla but this thing looks so good I first learned about it from chairman
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:37.200]   Gruber I believe if you're doing the bit torrent have a look at transmission because it is such a
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.640]   better than azureus better than tomato torrent things like that let me interrupt this is a very
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:48.320]   cocoa cocoa looking Mac application I don't know what's happening under the hood but care has been
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:52.480]   taken to some of the widgets are a little non standard looking and are increasingly
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:59.600]   fascistic ui world of the Mac but it's really pretty and it works great and it's kind of how
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:06.560]   old you gotta like that what's that uses growl so it's very mac-ish and it's got you can hit this
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:12.400]   little turtle if you want to throttle the bandwidth which is kind of cool but and it's got a really
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.760]   nice little inspector that'll let you do lots of stuff it's uh it says free isn't free and uh if
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.600]   you do the the bit torrent I would say have a look at it it's got lots of options and it looks good
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:27.280]   on your mac it will not make your eyes hurt well who well of course but what will pain would
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:34.640]   inflict upon your soul I asked all I know is that it was worth it to download horse by the way
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.160]   you're just 38 cents short of admission into heaven and then you find out that stealing via
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:44.880]   bit torrent is a lifetime fee of 50 cents are you gonna say the transmission was a wonderful piece
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.680]   of stuff St Paul says sorry Jack we don't have change for a bit torrent I'll do your I'll do my
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:54.720]   best to get you in you know I will but Andy you're gonna be up there waiting for is that
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.280]   of course well not waiting for you but you know I am in all places at all do you know wait I'm
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.120]   not waiting for anybody I'm going straight when you come to the gate when we get there and just
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.280]   intercede a little bit for us I'll I'll it'll be it'll be a not go plus let's call it plus 18
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.000]   I'm guessing my family members should be able to get in before you guys I love you guys but you
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.800]   know the family is probably not go party of 20 all right my program gotta pick yeah my program
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:27.840]   is free it will not it will not cost you to enter the pearly gates it's actually from my good friends
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:34.000]   Leah Culver and Kevin Rose they've pounces finally public and if you want to be a pounce
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.120]   member it's a Twitter clone but with some really nice additional features the ability to put files
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.440]   in there including video and images that's the big difference right the file sharing file sharing
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:49.680]   will also links and events are special it has I like it I think it's very pretty it's kind of
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:54.400]   a jikush sorta you know it's not because it doesn't do the RSS feeds it's not a presence
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:58.720]   focus thing and the other thing unlike jiku and twitter it's really not mobile phone focus
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:04.400]   and actually my application is a true application it's the pounce app which has been much updated
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:10.640]   and I think if you like twitter if you love the pounce app it's really very slick does allow you
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:16.480]   now to send direct messages to pounce friends the other thing pounce had that twitter is now
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.520]   started to add is the ability to have groups of friends that you can specifically message I think
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:28.240]   twitter has just started to add that feature to it but pounce is now public and they have a great
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:33.520]   app which is windows and mac it's done in adobe air and if you've never played with adobe air
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:39.360]   you'll have to download air first which is a 15 meg download but I think this is this is very
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:46.160]   very slick very pretty and you know you could look at it and say ah even better than twitterific I
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.880]   think so and if you want to use pounce I think you probably should use the pounce app certainly
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.680]   take a look at pounce that's interesting because it's for me the biggest feature of twitter
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:02.480]   is just the fact that so many people I know are twitter I agree and that's mostly uh well now
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.040]   you have to remember that pounce has been closed it's really been san francisco you know didgerati
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.160]   mostly uh so now that it's open it'll be interesting to see what happens I think I think that's
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:17.040]   actually one of the reasons why that you see the smart things that reveal themselves only with time
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.400]   I think the reason is why when you log in to twitter from the web page they tells you you have
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.680]   1756 followers just as a little subtle warning yeah that's fine hey if you want to have zero
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.600]   followers on pounce by all means we'll welcome you back well you know i'll be the first to say that
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.680]   I can't put the zero isn't it i'll be the first to say you know I left twitter for jiku I chose
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:42.480]   features over community and i was a mistake and i'm back on twitter where yeah there's the
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.920]   community that's absolutely the case i used to sniff and i i used to make fun of people who
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.320]   followed that kind of crap right now i'm the number eight most-friended person on twitter and i
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:59.920]   watch it i watch it i know i cut you down rhett the size you're the dane hook of twitter oh man
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.880]   there is so many of that out what what's safety funny you know do you want to know do you want to
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:10.800]   know we can do a super quick survey of the total twitter time uh timesick sink apps twitterholick
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:17.520]   dot com oh boy i'll show you the most followed people but the killer app the app that will drain

[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:34.240]   go to i'm gonna spell this out i think it's pronounced faveater but f-a-v-o-t-t-e-r
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:42.640]   fevotter dot m-a-t-o-p-e dot com i must have been there before because it knew immediately about

[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:06.560]   merlin's twitter's are worth the price of admission which is free but but absolutely a must read i
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.880]   will show you you can see if you want to go and ego surf yourself there y'all let you surf around

[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.160]   wow well that's exactly what rich was saying exactly it's so funny that that was totally on
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:56.960]   my mind this morning and it's so funny to hear him say it that way the stuff i'm just sorry our
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:01.680]   daughter has to grow up in a world where so few keyboard players still dresses surgeons
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:07.120]   two of my favorite two of my favorite bands in the 80s had a keyboard player that dressed as a
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:13.600]   surgeon that's the thing about merlin most of his twitter's are very 80 anchored in the 80s you really
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.880]   need to have you need to understand that what do you what do you what do you what do you what do you

[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:16.160]   55 56 on twitter holic but i'm not well twitter holic what i say about favoritor is that i think
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:21.520]   the dude is i don't quite understand this because it's kind of it's a little bit uh no only one person
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.480]   is faved any of my stuff now now what he's doing is i don't quite understand how he does this but i
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:32.000]   think it's people who have favored it had post-favored it the most get their votes counted more which is
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.680]   why i'm not on here well what's the color have to do oh that's how hot it is whether it's uh green
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:42.960]   or purple red there's nothing or so i hear but i don't really follow it this very carefully so i have
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:48.080]   only i have three faves on my hottest one see you're like you got thousands of people favoring you

[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:45.120]   Yes, you get your internet web browser. Type C-w-o-b.com into the URL address line. Hit
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.420]   return. Think happy thoughts. That has nothing to do with loading the page. But I think you
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:53.920]   should, you deserve happy thoughts. You need www on your C-w-o-b.com.
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:24:03.940]   Don't refer to it as the www. I like the picture of you. What is that? That's very funny.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:09.000]   That is hanging in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.820]   By the way, great new pictures thanks to Ranger Craig of Alcatraz on Andy's Flinger
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:14.820]   account.
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:20.180]   My good thanks to Ranger Craig of the National Park Service who gave me an exchange for
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:25.900]   my helping him out on some things he's putting together. Get ready to bookmark this. It's
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:33.100]   not up yet. Put an empty space in your podcast bookmarks for the Alcatraz podcast.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:40.100]   A podcast originating from Alcatraz. I'm going to get out of this joint one day. I'm
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:43.940]   going to do your podcast. Screws. If you try to unsubscribe, somebody shoots you. My
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:52.140]   buddy, people long to you, but my soul belongs to Jesus. So it was awesome. We spend like
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:57.380]   about 20 or 30 minutes looking at his podcast and giving me some advice, some of which hopefully
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:00.260]   was useful, some of which I'm sure he already knew because he's a very, very savvy guy.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:05.980]   He's like the internet guy at the rock. That's cool. And then he took me around all of the
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:12.060]   places, all kinds of places that you can't get into. The extremely spooky dungeon underneath
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:16.100]   Alcatraz. It turns out that the movie was not a lie. It was built over a civil war
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:20.820]   citadel. So there are basements and stuff that go back 150 years. It seems like a bad
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:24.580]   place to be left. And I'm very grateful to him for all sorts of things, but also for
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:27.540]   not leaving me there. You did that thing. You did that thing where you went and closed
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.260]   the door. Yes.
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.260]   That's sorry.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:34.500]   That's the darkest. Yeah, exactly. You're in this. And there are pictures there on my
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:40.660]   Flickr feed. You can see it from C.W.B. dot com. But this, you're in this place where they
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:45.540]   used to, these to keep conscientious objectors back and back in the first world war when
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:50.060]   conscientious objectors were treated where the most hated thing you could possibly be.
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:55.100]   It was also the place where if you misbehaved in Alcatraz and they thought that no Alcatraz
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:26:00.060]   is too nice for you, we're going to put you in the dungeon for 19 days because legally
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:03.900]   we can put you there for 19. If we put, if we want to put you there for 20 days, we have
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:07.980]   to file paperwork, but we can just decide to put you there for 19 days. That's where they
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:12.340]   put you. And Craig, he's a knight. He's not a cruel person. So he asked if it was okay
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:17.780]   for if I wanted to do this. And I eagerly sent it, went into one of the little cell
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:21.540]   that, you know, the conscientious objectors would stay in. Then you hear them walking
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:25.700]   away. They're like little like work lights that keep the thing barely illuminated. And
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:30.100]   they hear him walking walking away. Then you hear the steel door close. And then he turns
[01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:34.740]   off all the lights. And it's, and it's like, it's just like, you know, having a brain
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:40.580]   stem injury where you can't know sight, no, no, no, no, do they allow you to bring their
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:43.660]   teenagers to this because I think I could use that.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:48.260]   Oh, I, they were received the interesting thing and this, I'm not, this will sound
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:53.220]   rattle, rattle, but it was largely abandoned for a long time. And there was a occupation
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:57.020]   by Indians who were making a very, very important point and a very, did a very, very successful
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:00.940]   protest. So it's, so it's not like it was this museum that was preserved the way it
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:04.540]   was in 1963. There were people in and out of this place, you'll see graffiti. You was
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:08.780]   telling me, tell me about some guys, some people got, sometimes they rented out, they
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:14.260]   used to rent it out as a for a movie for movie and TV show shoots. And I guess this is the
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:19.060]   funniest story from the entire tour. I guess they had a big crew, their filming, I think
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:22.420]   it was actually a streets of San Francisco or something like that. And it's a big, the
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:26.260]   base of the dungeon is a big, big place with all these little rooms. I guess like two or
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:31.860]   three people in the crew decided to like, during downtime, do a little moonlight, do a little
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:37.300]   side project. And so there is a gay porno film that was actually in the dungeons.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:46.660]   Listeners, yeah, I invite you there in the car to, you know, after, after with the podcast,
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:50.500]   this podcast is nearly over. After it's done, spend five or ten minutes, thicken up good
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:56.100]   names for a gay porno film filmed in Alcatraz. But like, I gotta say this one last thing
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:01.260]   before I let you go, because there was a most, there is a photo in this photo series of Ranger
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:05.540]   Craig with his, with his phone. I don't know how the hell he was doing this, but he was
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:11.620]   getting tweets on his phone in the dungeons underneath Alcatraz. And believe you me, the
[01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:16.180]   next time I met my sister's house and I can't get one single bar coverage, I'm going to
[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:21.220]   be thinking about being in a dungeon underneath Alcatraz, the most hostile federal penitentiary
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:25.060]   in the world and getting three bars for the tweets as I was going on.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:29.540]   And they probably have a cell site on Alcatraz. That would be a good place to put a cell site.
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.820]   They must, you know, next to my sister's house would be another good place to put a cell site,
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:36.180]   but apparently federal prisoners are getting, will get better cell service than I, than my
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:39.540]   sister does. They haven't met my sister. They might have a point, but.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:44.900]   Well, Merlin, maybe you, maybe you and, and, and Matt could bring Eleanor, I'll bring the
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:49.380]   teenagers and we could do a family pick the dungeons. I would not, I'm putting a little bit of
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:53.380]   fear into that girl. It's just, I'm 12 weeks old. I'm too young to put in a dungeon. Think of it
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:57.300]   prophylactically. It's a, yeah, absolutely. You got to take, you got to take preventative
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:01.780]   measures. Yeah. Your father said we can let you out when you're 33.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:08.500]   Like 19 days. I think actually we're saying before we went on air that that is the best
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:11.620]   touristy thing that the Golden Gate of the two like don't miss.
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:15.220]   Well, now we got an end. We can see more stuff. All right. I'm going to wrap this up because I
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:21.140]   got to move on to more podcasts. I can't believe it. Merlin, man, is at 43folders.com.
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:24.340]   And I'm so glad you're back. Both of you. It's been good to have you on this show.
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:30.420]   Actually an amazingly interesting show. We also want to thank Rich Segal at BearBones.com
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:34.900]   for coming in and talking a little bit about Mack Heisten. I have a feeling next week we will
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:40.820]   hear some rebuttals. We'll see you then. Another Mack break is broke.
