[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.680]   I'll look at the web page and some ideas about what Apple
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.160]   might be talking about at their yearly developer conference.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160]   Good news for fans of Bob's Burgers.

[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.400]   Renee Richie from iMoor.com.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.320]   Did you just have an earthquake in Montreal?
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.960]   You have cameras all over the place.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.200]   Look at all those cameras.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.120]   I want to show you an Andy and Alex every week, Leo.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.400]   This is the end result of that.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   Ah, is a camera over your left shoulder?
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   Is that an HTC Vive sensor?
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.560]   Or is that over your left shoulder?
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.400]   Yes.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.920]   Yes.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.440]   Yes.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.040]   And then there's a top down camera mount.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.600]   There's some lights.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.720]   Every time I'm on this show, I buy more cameras.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.000]   Technically, the vibes is not a camera.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.800]   It's a--
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.720]   Display.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.400]   I don't know what it is.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.640]   No, the little things you put up in the corners of the room.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.560]   The thing--
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.000]   What do they call those?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.760]   Lighthouses?
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.920]   They're laser sensors?
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.480]   Yeah, but I don't--
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.320]   They rotate.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.320]   I know there's moving stuff spinning in there.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.720]   They ingest the world.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.920]   They're in world ingestor.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.240]   That's what they are.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.880]   Andy, not go for the Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.680]   Is he your hello, Andrew?
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.000]   Hey, there.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.240]   Hi, there.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.800]   Hello there.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.680]   Good to see you again.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.360]   And from Washington, DC, the nation's capital
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.560]   at pixelcore.com, Alex Lindsey, who was just here
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.440]   a few days ago.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.040]   But now he's back in DC.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.600]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.760]   We're getting some--
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.560]   We're getting some studios set up.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.080]   And so I'm out here for the next couple of weeks.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.560]   Nice.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.480]   Working with the guys.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.280]   Nice.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.040]   Well, all three of you have gathered together
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.680]   to celebrate the--
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.240]   if Apple buys texture, how long can it be before they buy me?
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.800]   I'm just saying, I'm for sale.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.280]   I'm coming.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.800]   We don't know how much texture our sponsor, which
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.960]   is Netflix for magazine, $10 a month, gives you 200 magazines.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.520]   Now, an Apple property.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.080]   You said you talked to them about their plans, Renee Richie?
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.640]   Well, I started seeing different reports.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.440]   Like some reports said that Apple was going to be full--
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.440]   Eddie Q had said that Apple was going to be folding it
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.080]   into the news app.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.880]   And when you--
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.200]   CNN did not make the video or the audio of it.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.840]   I mean, for a TV show, they did not
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   make anything available immediately.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.000]   So I managed to get--
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.320]   thanks to the generosity of some people.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.200]   I actually get a bootleg copy and very carefully go through it.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.000]   And the question was very--
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Or question was very leading.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.720]   --was the South by Southwest talk?
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   Yeah, South by Southwest talk with Darryl.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.720]   And he said-- the question was very leading.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.520]   What is texture going to do for Apple News?
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.800]   And at the end, Eddie talked about the integration of them.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.360]   And then a lot of people reported that as Apple
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.560]   folding it into Apple News.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.720]   And when I asked about it, they said
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.040]   that no decisions have been made yet.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.200]   And that could just be them covering their bases,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.240]   because maybe that's what they're
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.920]   thinking of doing, but they don't know if it'll work out
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   the way they want.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.560]   Or if the subscription service is more valuable,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.200]   some other place.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.640]   Or if it's going to go in iBooks,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.480]   because that's going to be--
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.800]   iBooks is going to become Books, a whole different app.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.080]   So there's a lot of possibilities.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.000]   I think they just want to keep their options open.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.240]   But they did say a couple of things.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.560]   One is that they're going to keep all the existing apps going.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.720]   Because they have a big subscriber base.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.520]   They have iOS, Android, Kindle Fire, and Windows.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.160]   I think Windows 10, but it might just be a generic Windows app.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.760]   And all of those are going to keep going.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.580]   And everyone who's going to have the same functionality
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.880]   they've had before.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.560]   It's only available in the US and Canada.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.760]   So it's not an international app by any means yet.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.000]   And it's partly owned by Rogers in Canada.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.360]   So strange partnerships there.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.160]   It was founded by--
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.760]   I think it was founded by Connie Nast and hers.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.000]   I think Meredith has a stake for Rogers.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.800]   To be a host for magazines, yeah.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.520]   I mean, it's easy to see how a lot of the conversation got
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.960]   misconstrued.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.520]   I thought it was a lot of interesting stuff
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.640]   he was talking about, about how--
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.560]   the point he was making was that it was part of a larger sort
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.320]   of philosophical initiative to talk about the Apple News app
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.520]   as curated news as a place where, at some point,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.720]   some human with an IQ larger than room temperature
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.680]   has looked at this news article and said, OK, this is not
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.120]   garbage, we will let the-- we will let the Apple News app see
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.840]   this.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.000]   And so he was talking about texture as magazine content
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.040]   because it's been bought and paid for,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.760]   because it's not generally news of the last 45 seconds.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.120]   It's a little bit better vetted.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.920]   So he felt as though it's a better addition for that larger
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.160]   portfolio of Apple News and Apple content as,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.320]   this is a safe place.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.040]   You can trust what we're talking about right here.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.920]   I'm sure it'll go.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.880]   It'll be Apple treat it the same way they did PRSS.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.000]   The digital magazine platform they acquired three years ago
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.800]   that was never heard from again.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.320]   I mean, they had a long record of--
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.880]   I mean, there's the newsstand bodies
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.520]   delivering the streets.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.840]   It was at the Rupert Murdoch property.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.880]   I'm blanking on the daily--
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.320]   Oh, yeah, the daily.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.600]   But those were shut down by the daily.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.400]   The PRSS is probably the closest thing
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.160]   to the texture acquisition.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.920]   Apple bought them in September three years ago,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.080]   almost four years ago.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.800]   And if I go now to the PR--
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.240]   can you show my screen?
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.040]   If I go now to the PRSS website, it's a vital and growing
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.680]   concern.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.640]   No, this red site cannot be reached.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.840]   They just basically took it over and shut it down.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.480]   So I think all bets are off as to what Apple might do with this.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   It's clear that Apple doesn't want an app called Texture
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.680]   in its portfolio.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.840]   Does it?
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.000]   Yeah, I could see that.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.200]   Really?
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.880]   I'll start going ahead, Alex.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.040]   I think that--
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.240]   I think one of the things that Apple may try to do--
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.760]   and maybe I'm wishful thinking.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.880]   So we don't know.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.960]   But I think that it does give you access
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.160]   to the idea of approaching publishers
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.600]   to possibly add more content that
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.280]   is more interactive into the content that's being distributed.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.480]   So I think that the big texture is great.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.480]   I'm a subscriber.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.680]   I'm a user.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.360]   But you still feel like this is still taking an old technology
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.600]   and putting it into your iPad, as opposed to really building
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.040]   content that's designed for that next--
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.600]   whatever that next thing is.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.920]   Well, I think that--
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.760]   How all in is Apple on Apple News?
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.800]   Is that still important to Apple?
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.720]   It's both important and not it?
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.440]   It's not-- I'm sorry.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.520]   I'll make it very quickly.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.440]   I think that Apple News is not so much the app itself,
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.760]   so much as the conduit.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.600]   So long as it's part of that dashboard,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.840]   the first thing you want to look at when you wake up,
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.160]   and the thing you want to keep dipping into as the day goes
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.640]   by, I think that's a very important strategic solution
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.160]   for them.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.320]   So this would make sense as something that would,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.600]   as Eddie Q did or did not say, what
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   was the actual quote, Renee?
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.200]   I actually spent part of the night transcribing it,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.600]   so I would have it available.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.320]   So the question was, how does acquiring texture
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.560]   advance the grand strategy of Apple News?
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   And at the very end, Q says that-- well, basically,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.800]   I'll tell you what the whole thing he says is,
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.120]   I think there are a few things that we've always
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.160]   cared about at Apple News.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.800]   First of all, we wanted to bring great articles
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.000]   from trusted sources in a beautiful layout,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.160]   and that was the premise of Apple News we started with.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.280]   If you do that, lots of customers will use it and love it.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.680]   Obviously, texture with the brands I just told you about,
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.640]   they have magazines from Esquire to Vanity Fair
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.240]   to Times to Sports Illustrated.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.640]   Some of the best magazines in the world.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.760]   They have some incredible content,
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.080]   and content takes a long time to create.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.200]   So they're in-depth articles, and so we're really excited
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.240]   about bringing that into Apple News to augment all
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.280]   of the other stuff that we have from thousands
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   of other publishers.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.000]   But our key is curation.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.120]   We want the best articles.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.560]   We want them to look amazing.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.120]   We want them to be from trusted sources
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.440]   so that we don't have a lot of the issues
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.840]   that have been going around in the marketplace.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.040]   So I can see why that was synopsized as they're
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.800]   going to fold it into Apple News.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.440]   That's sort of what it sounds like.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.760]   It is shorting your app in several ways.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.600]   Sorry.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.960]   It is shorting your app in several ways,
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.320]   because it came out, it launched in the US,
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.000]   it quickly went to the UK and Australia,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   and then it stopped.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.880]   Apple put out Apple Music in 100 countries
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.320]   the same time, the same day.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.400]   They haven't done that for news,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.760]   but they have spent a lot of time improving
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.600]   the features of news.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.320]   They've got Siri-based machine learning intelligence.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.400]   They've been doing a wonderful job.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.480]   Now they're doing March Madness,
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.600]   but they did the Winter Olympics,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.720]   and they did the Oscars.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.080]   They've got a huge team of editors.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.520]   They've hired an editor in chief.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.840]   And I think what Apple sees is almost like they think
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   they have part of Tim Cook's Mandate,
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.120]   and it was Steve Jobs' thing too.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.320]   They want to save news, which sounds ludicrous on its face,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.880]   but they look at Amazon and Google,
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.280]   and they have these problems where they basically
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.720]   took other people's content and monetized it
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.240]   and sucked all the revenue out of it,
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.960]   and it's destroyed a lot of publishers.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.200]   They said, come on, we'll put you in news
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.800]   and we'll put you in Facebook video,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.000]   and then he turned on and said, oh, sorry,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.280]   we don't mean it, and those companies went bankrupt.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.600]   And I think that Apple has almost like an erin-sork
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.960]   and esk-romantic feeling of what news can be
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.160]   and what news should be.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.960]   Now it can power and inform and create communication,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.520]   and they want to, as much as they can,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.560]   use iOS as a platform for doing that,
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.040]   similar to how when they acquire beats,
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.400]   they use that as a platform,
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.280]   sort of create an all-encompassing music library in the sky.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.920]   - Yeah, advertising came up a lot
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.120]   during that conversation in which this,
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.880]   when you're getting content from these magazines,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.400]   you're not necessarily getting content
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.000]   that needs to be subsidized by advertising.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.360]   This is a point that EdiCue was making
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.080]   that whereas stuff that comes online,
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.780]   at some point you have to get people to click,
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.920]   you have to get people to actually imprint
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.520]   and add on the thing, and this will help to elevate
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.360]   the level of content to have this texture content.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.800]   It's more complicated than that, however,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.800]   a lot of the, you forget about how much newspaper
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.640]   ad revenue came, not from people advertising,
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.560]   the things that you see advertised on the web typically,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.360]   but you're talking about classified ads,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.000]   you're talking about legal ads,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.520]   you're talking about just like the weekly,
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.440]   the weekly supermarket supplement,
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.280]   you're talking about things that would have gone away anyway,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.360]   unless someone fire bombed an LCD plant
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.480]   and made sure that phones and tablets never existed.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.880]   So it's a little bit more complicated than that,
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.520]   but this is the first time I've heard Apple talk about news
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.480]   as something other than, oh, well,
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.040]   these other people have this app,
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.520]   we're gonna have this app too.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.440]   It's interesting for them to brand it
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.400]   as part of their overall company identity as look,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.200]   it's a nightmare out there because of largely
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.400]   because it's ad based and profile based content,
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.160]   we're a safe place where you can be,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.000]   we're not gonna tell you that it's the safest,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.200]   it's objectively no danger of anything happening everywhere,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.520]   but at least you can trust if you click on an Apple News app
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.480]   that there are fewer shenanigans going on
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.400]   than maybe you would find elsewhere on Facebook and Google.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.240]   - Is the business model for texture,
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.680]   is it the same as Netflix where,
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.400]   or not necessarily Netflix, but let's say,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.080]   alinda.com or something like that,
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.600]   where are they, everyone getting an equal amount of income
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.600]   or are they getting per sub like we would with cable?
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.480]   - They haven't said, they haven't said anything.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.560]   - They haven't said anything used.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.840]   - 'Cause that'd be really interesting to see.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.880]   - So they haven't disclosed almost anything.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.840]   - Right, 'cause it's interesting to know whether
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.520]   it's based on how many people are reading your magazine
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.920]   as opposed to maybe you get a base amount per sub
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.640]   and then a higher amount based on usage.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.400]   And I just be curious how that looks,
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.320]   but I do think that what Apple gets access to,
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.920]   depending on how they use it, is a lot of walled gardens.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.080]   A lot of the content in those magazines
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.080]   is not ending up in Facebook, is not ending up
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.720]   in a lot of these things because they don't make it
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.120]   available unless you're a subscriber.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.520]   And so I think that those are things that are now
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.760]   going to be accessible in the newsfeed
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.600]   that haven't been, in any increase that.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.040]   If you feel like you can publishing through,
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.080]   texture is gonna give you a larger market
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.680]   and you can end a sustainable market,
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.040]   you may be more interested in doing that
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.920]   than putting it up on the web.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   - Yeah, particularly things. - For one of the things
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.840]   that comes from publishers.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.960]   - Well, but particularly if this deal gives them
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.400]   the launching pad from which develop deeper relationships
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.960]   with magazines like the New Yorker with Esquire
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.840]   because they have deep, deep, deep content.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.720]   And so we're not just talking about nostalgia buffs
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.600]   who would like to read, Frank Sinatra has a cold
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.480]   by Harlan Ellison, which I recommend you
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.560]   'cause you seek and find out 'cause it is a hell of an article.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.360]   But it means that when there's a piece of news
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.800]   like when Harlan Ellison finally dies,
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.200]   there's gonna be lots of obituaries,
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.600]   but here is the place you can find one of his most important
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.840]   pieces of writing and it will surface right to the top.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.360]   When there's-- - If you look for that one though,
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.760]   you won't find it, it's Gates Elise.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.840]   But other than that, yeah.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.440]   - I'm sorry, my brother.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.600]   - Well, I would like to read Harlan Ellison's version
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.080]   is that, or whatever.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.040]   - I forget because I forgot because one of the key scenes
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.080]   in that is Harlan Ellison picking up like--
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.040]   - Yes, it's a wonderful article which everybody should read.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.960]   So I don't pretend to have inside knowledge,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.120]   although because texture's been a sponsor,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.520]   we've talked to the founders and we've talked to them before.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.440]   So I'm not speaking from inside knowledge,
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.440]   but A, because it was founded by four big magazines,
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.080]   founded by Conde Nast, which owns The New Yorker
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.840]   and among other things.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.520]   The Hearst Corporation, which owns a bunch of magazines,
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.400]   Meredith, which owns a bunch of magazines and TV stations,
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.640]   Rogers, does Rogers own magazines in Canada?
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.240]   - They own everything we own.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.200]   - Yeah, and KK and R, which is an investment company
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.360]   which probably owns magazines.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.880]   So, and I do know that they've been adding magazines
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.600]   over time, I'm sure that they have a,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.080]   when you get the magazine on texture,
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.200]   you get the ads that are in the magazine,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.120]   so those are not removed.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.640]   I'd be my guess that you get some money from it
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.160]   because it's in lieu of a subscription, right?
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.000]   So I would guess there are payouts to the,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.440]   I don't know again, this is not inside knowledge,
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.480]   but I would guess there are payouts to the magazine companies
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.240]   because instead of buying the New Yorker subscription,
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.240]   you buy a $10 subscription to texture
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.960]   and you get the New Yorker,
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.480]   I would guess that the New Yorker's happy to get that buck
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.400]   or whatever because that's at least something
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.560]   and they still have, and they can add it
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.280]   to their circulation for the advertisers.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.040]   I just don't see Apple keeping it going
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.760]   'cause it's orthogonal to what Apple's all up to already
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.800]   and frankly, I gotta say the News app is far
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.960]   from the best news app on iOS.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.120]   So Apple needs to do, if they care about the News app,
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.400]   they got a long way to go.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.520]   I mean, it comes on every iOS device,
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.280]   so I guess it's probably got some real traction,
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.200]   but it's not a great-- - Did you see the numbers
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.040]   you mentioned, like he said,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.920]   some things like the New York Times
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.320]   or maybe another CNN he said was getting some like 60
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.960]   to 70% of their views for the News app now.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.480]   - Yeah, and as you pointed out,
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.320]   industry changes-- - Industry changing.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.480]   - Since Facebook has really dumped on these guys,
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.920]   they're probably very thrilled to be,
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.080]   you know, of course you got the stock comment
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.240]   from all the owners saying, "Oh, great, Apple's,
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.040]   what a great company to be working with."
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.320]   - We didn't lose our money on the app.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.080]   - Well, that's the thing, it could very well be
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.920]   that the app is a failure and these come, I don't know,
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.800]   again, the app is a failure and that these companies
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.520]   are saying, "Oh God, let's just get out of this."
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.720]   Oh, thank God, Apple take us back.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.560]   I don't think it's true.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.880]   - I think that Apple has two things that they could be doing
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.680]   and basically working with these publishers and saying,
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.680]   "Hey, give us one article, two articles a week
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.560]   or one article, two articles a month for Apple News.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.960]   It's still gonna drive people if they wanna buy the rest
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.880]   of the magazine to go back and--
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.200]   - Yeah, that might be a better pitch.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   Yeah, that might be a better pitch.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.760]   - You know, so now they have access to all these articles
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.640]   that are not available anywhere else on the web,
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.560]   except for Apple News.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.280]   So right now, Apple News is mostly scraping stuff
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.680]   that is non-exclusive.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.560]   So being able to have exclusive stuff that's only available
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.800]   for Apple News as samples that would then drive back
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.200]   to online subscriptions, I think, is one area
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.800]   that could be really interesting for the publishers,
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.680]   as well as, I still think that Apple at some point
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.080]   may consider interactive magazines or interactive content
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.000]   to be something that lets them step iOS ahead
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.600]   of all the other, basically away from Kindle,
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.760]   because Kindle could never keep up with that
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.080]   and Android would have to build a unified solution
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.920]   to do a couple of things.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.560]   - I'm interested in the model for Apple News.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.920]   It has big-ass banner ads, which I find very repulsive.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.440]   This is a big banner ad.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.440]   And then it also seems to love the Huffington Post,
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.480]   which I don't think that's my traffic.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.320]   That's not generated from my interest,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.160]   which is supposedly-
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.000]   - I don't get a Huffington Post.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.840]   - You don't?
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.680]   - I get other- - I get other
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.120]   - You guys get a Huffington Post?
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.960]   'Cause I get a ton of-
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.120]   - No, there's no Apple News in Canada,
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.520]   so I have to pretend that I'm in the US
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.360]   to have the app running, so it acts like,
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.080]   no, I basically have an iPhone that is basically set up
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.760]   entirely as if it's a US iPhone and I have Apple News on there.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.680]   - I'm just assuming that it does skew towards
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   what you click on and what you can set it up in initially.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.480]   My thing with this though is I think this is gonna be very
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.600]   similar to how they went with Apple Music.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.920]   They acquired Beats, which had a basic subscription service,
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.000]   and then they build that out so that,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.440]   'cause remember Apple's thing is that there's only
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.680]   a certain amount of iPhones they can sell.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.840]   Eventually they'll get to the point where,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.400]   they've saturated a lot of that market
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.680]   and everything they can do to add value to the iPhone
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.040]   and to get incrementally more revenue from a customer,
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.240]   'cause Apple now talks about revenue per customer,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.200]   not just overall revenue.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.880]   If you get someone to subscribe to Apple Music,
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.400]   if you get someone to subscribe to whatever
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.320]   they end up calling texture,
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.480]   or even if they just end up calling it texture,
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.320]   that's $10 per customer per month,
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.560]   and that provides, you stay with Apple
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.320]   because they're giving you all these services,
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   and maybe there's a backlash against bots
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.760]   and against fake news and against social news,
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.240]   and people wanna be able to access the newspapers,
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.200]   even if it's nostalgia, the newspapers and magazines
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.480]   that they love, and Apple can offer that as a service
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.640]   and they can grow that out and you'll have your,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.920]   and then they can make products around it,
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.040]   like Apple Music powers the HomePod
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.760]   and who knows what other devices they're working on,
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.240]   but maybe the magazine becomes an integral part of iPad
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.240]   or whatever tablet experience they're working on.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.720]   It just gives them more content to showcase on their platform,
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.120]   and we're not even talking original content,
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.520]   like Netflix went from catalog aggregation
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.360]   to original content at some point.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.640]   Apple's doing that for TV now,
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.360]   but who knows if Apple editorial, Evan Starz,
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.040]   it becomes more active, like App Store editorial has become,
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.120]   and then you start having articles
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.800]   that are chosen and vetted by Apple's team,
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.360]   it becomes very interesting.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.880]   - Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.080]   Apple's associated with the success of the iPhone,
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.680]   but at some point people are not gonna be wanting iPhones
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.640]   anymore, and they're already being outpaced
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.320]   by other platforms, largely only because
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.120]   of the diversity of hardware that's available to.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.600]   The more they, if they wanna make money
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.680]   from everybody out there, not just people
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.880]   who are Apple fans, 'cause that's a dead end.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.080]   At some point it's not, they're not gonna have enough money
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.960]   to do what they wanna do, they're not gonna have enough money
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.440]   to have the sort of firepower they wanna have.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.280]   So it really is in their best interest
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.080]   to maintain this platform, build out Apple news
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.160]   as a service like a pocket where no matter
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.760]   what kind of device you have, no matter what it's hooked up to,
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.640]   you can still access this content.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.600]   And if it also helps to funnel people
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.200]   into buying iPads, all the better.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.120]   But I don't think this means by any means
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.280]   that they're gonna be shutting down that
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.400]   for any other platform, 'cause again,
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.360]   how many times have Apple said that we are really,
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.160]   really bullish on becoming a service company?
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.680]   Because again, they are way smarter than we are
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.080]   when it comes to looking at the hardware market.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.760]   It's gonna be a problem if they're just gonna be relying
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.040]   on selling a premium hardware at 40% markup.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.440]   So the more they, if they can get $7 billion
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.760]   to give them a penny each, that adds up.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.880]   - I, for the record, I will say that within two years,
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.240]   I think that texture will only be available on the iOS.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.240]   - I agree 100%.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.560]   I don't think it'll take two years.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.920]   - I'm just saying, I'm being conservative.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.760]   I think Biden.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.440]   - Well, they still have beats on Android.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.280]   (laughing)
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.440]   - Or was this a million, I don't know.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.000]   - I didn't spend billions on it for one thing.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.640]   - No, but I think the point is that
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.160]   once you have the family plan, it's for the,
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.080]   you have three iPhones in your family, one Android,
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.480]   two iPhones, two Android's.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.520]   And you get the family plan, it means it's more valuable
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.520]   to you because even the Android people can use it.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.080]   And it's very little maintenance to keep going.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.440]   And it is a little bit of, you're getting more of a taste
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.000]   of the Apple experience.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.480]   The Apple Music on Android, it's a terrible app.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.640]   I have it on my Pixel.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.480]   - Yeah.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.200]   - I think that you'll get the texture on non-IOS devices.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.640]   You just won't know that it's texture.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   I think that at some point,
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.640]   - You see it be an Apple price.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.760]   - The branding will go away.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.000]   Yeah, I think that at some point,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.400]   they'll figure out how to make it
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.680]   into a subscription model through iBooks
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.240]   or even through Apple Music or whatever they rename that to
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.560]   after they realize that people are coming to Apple Music
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.080]   for things other than music.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.200]   There's still no clarity on where do you go
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:51.040]   for this new series that the creator of Bob's Burgers
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.960]   is gonna be creating for them.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.000]   Do they go to Apple Music?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.080]   Do they go to Apple?
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.600]   Do they go to iTunes?
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.560]   So I think that there's going to be a convergence,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.840]   not so much of Mac OS or iOS.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.600]   The more important one is gonna be the convergence
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.040]   of their content delivery.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.360]   And I'd be really surprised
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.920]   if they don't try to make that multiple platform.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.920]   - If they decide that they want to add more interactivity,
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.040]   they'll kill off all the other ones
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.560]   because otherwise you end up in lowest
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.080]   common denominator development.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.440]   And so if they decide just to keep on
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.400]   letting magazines be magazines and be basically 2D things
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.280]   that are on your tablet,
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.320]   then they could probably last a bit longer.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.960]   But I think that as soon as they decide we want to,
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.320]   we wanna do something that's different
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   or now they have access to all these publishers
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.640]   and they have possibly they grow to a point
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.360]   where they are the access to the outside world
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.400]   for these publishers,
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.560]   gives them a lot of leverage to go back
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.840]   and do the things that they tried to do
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.120]   when they stalled out, basically they had no leverage.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.840]   They went to a bunch of textbook companies
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.000]   and decided that iBooks was not a good market
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.520]   to go into.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.600]   And so I still think that there's a massive future
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.000]   in that area.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.680]   No one has a really good development platform
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.320]   and I think that this could be something
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.920]   that could lean towards that.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.600]   But if they decided to do that,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.040]   then they would get rid of the other platforms
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.160]   pretty quickly 'cause they're just dead weight.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.640]   - Apple has so much money.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.760]   This probably, I mean, they had $50 million
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.160]   in venture funding.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.320]   It probably didn't cost them more than 100 million,
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.760]   which is really around the year.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.280]   - Is there money at E.K. self-locations?
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.680]   - Yeah, it's rounding air.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   I think honestly, they looked at it and they said,
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.520]   this would be great.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.320]   We could open a conversation with all these publishers.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.880]   That's all they, I think it's about relationships.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.920]   I don't think they're really,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.960]   in fact, I really wonder if they wanna be in the content business.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.080]   I mean, that's what E.K. said,
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.320]   but that's his job, right, to be in the content business.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.040]   I really wonder if they wanna be in that business at all.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.600]   - Now, they're spending way too much money
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.440]   to not be interested in what they're buying.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.520]   I mean, there, it's--
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.360]   - Well, this one--
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.600]   - I doubt this was expensive.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.640]   I know you're, but there's been a billion on TV.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.320]   But also in the same interview,
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.480]   who's, I think he was asked about buying,
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.240]   buying something as big as, let's say, Sony,
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.720]   which they could possibly do.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.880]   And he was, he basically said that we're not,
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.360]   we don't do, we don't do well buying huge companies
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.840]   that have them then have to sort of dilute Apple.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.640]   We buy small companies that can make Apple better,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.720]   make Apple more Apple-E, so to speak.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.840]   Just, so I think, like I said,
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.720]   if the acquisition of texture is the,
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.120]   the Mrs. Dash seasoning that makes a bunch of different,
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.960]   a bunch of different products better,
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.920]   I think that that's a smart move.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.520]   - I think it's, I think it's much more like,
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.000]   kind of, something around that.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.360]   And, honestly, I mean, let me ask you guys,
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.080]   what is the best news app on iOS?
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.400]   We take, the reason I'm interested,
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.000]   we covered this on iOS today earlier.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.560]   - It's the New York Times app.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.000]   - So that's single publisher.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.840]   How about you?
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.760]   - I think, Alex.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.880]   - Every morning, I'm, every morning for the last,
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.920]   I don't know, five or six years, I use Flipboard.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.400]   I don't, I, as you know,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.800]   I know it's a little bit old to you,
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.280]   but to me, it's like the usage of it,
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.240]   and the way it works, and everything else,
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.080]   totally works for me.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.240]   - No, in fact, I started using Flipboard again.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.560]   Lisa, my wife said, "You should really try Flipboard,
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.080]   "it's great," and she's right.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.320]   And it's, it's everything Apple news could be,
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.520]   but isn't, in my opinion.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.360]   What do you like, Renee?
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.040]   I know you're in Canada, so that,
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.720]   maybe John misses you a little bit.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.200]   You can't really get Apple news officially.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.000]   - No, I start off with Apple news,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.480]   and then I also go through Flipboard,
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.000]   and I go through Nuzzle,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.640]   although that's changed a lot,
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.520]   because again, being in Canada,
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.000]   maybe Americans are as tired of it,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.880]   or as realist powerless as I do,
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.360]   that a lot of the social news is just not stuff I wanna read.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.680]   - Yeah, this is actually probably not a good time
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.760]   to ask this question, because for the last year,
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.560]   news has been very much tilted in one direction,
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.240]   thanks to our president,
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.360]   and it, yeah, it gets kind of monotonic.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.640]   It's boring after a while, you wanna read something different.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.480]   Maybe Apple news is good for that.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.560]   - Well, we also see the,
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.880]   we also see the opposite effect from that.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.880]   I mean, like our traffic is greatly skewed now,
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.800]   because people never used to read about politics.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.520]   They used to read about technology, it was fun,
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.080]   and now everyone's reading about politics,
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.240]   so they're not reading about technology.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.440]   - I would say the same thing is happening
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.840]   in that technology podcast,
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.640]   actually all podcasts that aren't about Donald Trump.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.040]   (laughs)
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.720]   Yeah, people, so that's what they're reading right now.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.520]   That'll, you know, that shifts back and forth.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.000]   I mean, texture is really only a small part
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.440]   of the conversation, the larger conversation is,
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.240]   what is Apple's thinking,
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.200]   and where are they going,
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.680]   and why these content acquisitions.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.640]   And so it doesn't really matter
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.040]   whether texture lives or dies under Apple's wing,
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.840]   as much as it's an indicator of what Apple's up to.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.800]   - I will tell you this, Lillio,
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.000]   is that when I opened up texture to talk about it yesterday,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.640]   right front and center was the entertainment article
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.560]   about Avengers Infinity Wars,
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.920]   and I would probably not have seen that,
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.200]   'cause I don't go to newsstands anymore,
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.280]   and it wouldn't have shown up.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.440]   - And you read a cover to cover, I'm sure.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.360]   It is so long, so in depth,
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   and it's presented like it is in the magazine,
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.800]   and I know that's, like the interface is not great.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.440]   Sometimes you pay sideways to get,
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.840]   to go through stories, sometimes you page up and down,
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.520]   again, it should always be consistent,
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.760]   and sometimes it does look like a bit of a rendered PDF,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.720]   and other times it's fine.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.440]   I mean, I put up with comic book interfaces
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.120]   that are sometimes just as bad, if not worse,
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.960]   but it was just having it there,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.360]   and again, I gave texture to my mom for Christmas,
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.200]   and she loves it because she was fine.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.080]   - It's a great product, to the people who use magazines.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.240]   - Yeah, the people who use it are gonna be very upset
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.520]   if Apple doesn't continue it,
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   but can anybody think of an app that Apple has acquired,
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.800]   and then continue to run as a standalone app?
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.460]   - Workflow, most recently.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.240]   - Yeah. - Workflow.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.760]   - Yeah, I'm wondering how long that has for this world.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.200]   (laughs)
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.240]   - Well, it'll eventually become--
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.800]   - They bought workflow for the engineers,
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.120]   they didn't buy workflow for the app.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.160]   - Well, no, I think that they're pivoting away
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   from AppleScript and other 1980s-style scripting environments
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.240]   and towards something a little bit more modern and visual.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.240]   I think that's very, very much in line for me.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.720]   - So maybe it is the app, yeah.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.680]   - Yeah, they absolutely absolutely need automation.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.520]   Most of the people we talk to on the show
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.800]   are people are individual users,
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.320]   but there are people who need to set up 400 iOS devices
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.600]   at the same time when they need to bite the--
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.680]   - There are examples of applications,
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.160]   like as you mentioned, Andy, and there's logic
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.960]   and Final Cut that Apple purchased
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.360]   and kept going as applications.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.200]   I'm not-- - Okay.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.720]   - Clarice works and you know,
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.560]   a filmmaker for sure. (laughs)
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.600]   But what about apps?
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.320]   Like what about iPhone and iPad apps?
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.600]   Is there much of a history of that?
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.000]   It seems, I mean, I think workflow might be the exception
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.640]   that proves the rule, frankly.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   - It is an exception.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.040]   A lot of them, they do hire for the talent,
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.480]   and then those, like they bought color
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.360]   and that team went and redid the photo app.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.520]   - There's far more apps that Apple bought the company
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.760]   and then killed the app.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.240]   - Going Siri, famously, right?
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.200]   - Siri, yeah.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.040]   There's actually an article.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.280]   - But again, Beats, the Beats became the Apple Music app.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.200]   It's not Beats anymore, but it's a very similar app
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.160]   and it's still on Android.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   - Right.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.920]   Yeah, that makes sense 'cause they needed
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.040]   a streaming music app and they had a huge streaming music
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.560]   for so long, they really had nothing.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   - And they need subscription and services revenue,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.200]   which is why I think that they'll keep this going
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.040]   in some form or another.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.120]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:08.960]   I mean, they get--
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.240]   - There's only so many things you get people subscribe to
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.720]   and they didn't buy comics all over the music.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.560]   - It goes along with music.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.480]   - Right, it goes along with TV, goes along.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.240]   So it's just another content stream
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   that people subscribe to.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.080]   - Okay, yep.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.600]   - We'll talk about Apple.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   - And they're unlimited funds because their market cap now
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.760]   is $916.2 billion and a number of people
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.560]   have talked about the fact that they're gonna,
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.520]   they may well be soon the first trillion dollar company
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.400]   in history. - Billion with the tea?
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.720]   - Do we wanna lay a bet on when?
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.640]   - Well, we've been talking about this for months, right?
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.560]   We thought it'd get there before this.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.080]   - Was it Christopher Mims on Twitter yesterday
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.960]   who said all Apple has to do is put the word blockchain
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.160]   on a press release and they'll be there in the world?
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.600]   (laughing)
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.920]   - MKB-- - MKB--
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.200]   - It could mine Bitcoin.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.720]   - MKBHD had the tweet of the moment in his tweet.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.720]   He said, "Apple, let me see if I can find it.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.360]   I'm scrolling now.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.880]   Apple's cap, fun fact.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.320]   Apple's cap is closing in on a trillion dollars
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.520]   if you had trillion dollars, you could literally buy
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.640]   every single NFL NBA and MLS team for NASA
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   and 100,000 Teslas and still have money left over,
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.200]   but you couldn't buy Apple.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.960]   But what's interesting to me about this is 154,000 likes
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.640]   and 38,000 retweets.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.880]   Obviously, this has captured people's imagination.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   - So I'm gonna guess June 1st.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.280]   - June 1st, why June 1st?
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.760]   - 'Cause it's the Friday before WWDC.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.280]   - Oh, and we know that now because Apple has announced
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   that WWDC is coming up March, what was it March?
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.760]   - June 4th, June 4th, or 8th.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.880]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.960]   - You can apply, I think, until March 22nd.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.800]   - Is that right?
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.680]   - You can register, so can you register right now?
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.040]   - That's like Game of Thrones artwork.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.840]   It has passed through Johnny Ives Lab
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.680]   and got like just totally white-coded.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.000]   - Yeah, it's gonna be the whitest WWDC ever.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   (laughing)
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.520]   Don't worry, there will be no joy.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.760]   - You go to Apple.com/something.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.600]   - It'll be everything free.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.440]   - That's all updated.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.320]   - This is Zach Hall's video.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.840]   Is that from Apple?
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.680]   That's nice.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.520]   - I believe so.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.360]   - Is that the WDC?
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   What is the Apple?
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.200]   - I think it's Apple.com/WWDC.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   (humming)
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.560]   - It looks like it, doesn't it?
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.640]   - It's got, so for people who are listening,
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.960]   it's got the 3D.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.560]   - It's like, surprisingly simple.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.280]   - Stuff rising up, ooh, I love that.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.200]   - Maybe Zach made it animated.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.280]   - That would have taken a while.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.680]   I don't know if he'd be exact.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   - Where did he find it?
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.680]   - It's not.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.480]   - It wouldn't be hard to do that.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.400]   - Maybe he did that
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.120]   'cause it's not animated on the Apple page.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.440]   Unless I'm using Google Chrome,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.320]   it won't do that for me, that's probably why.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.760]   - I mean, once you have all the basic assets,
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.440]   it's like a couple keyframes and then you enter in a light.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.120]   - Oh, stop it, you show off.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:56.960]   Now.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.800]   - I'm just saying.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   (laughing)
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.920]   - There's a more button with the app icon.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.800]   - Let's read the tealies here.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.640]   - I like your not fitting on this job.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.160]   (laughing)
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.640]   - What's the orb thing?
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.760]   The orb thing is throwing me.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.040]   - Which orb thing?
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.040]   - The big circle in the top left.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:13.880]   - The floating over the top.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.440]   - Ooh, that's augmented reality, baby.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.280]   - Is that Siri?
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.320]   - Or V, maybe VR.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.840]   - Material design.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.680]   - And the--
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.520]   (snoring)
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.280]   - This is very spumorphic 3D design.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.800]   I love the teardrop windows.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.200]   And yeah, this is, it's just all of Apple's controls, right?
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.800]   And in a kind of 3D form.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.080]   - But you see, but it's interesting.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.880]   You look at the above that Bob,
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.600]   you see a 3D bounding box,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.160]   or a bounding box for 3D object.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.240]   That's particularly cool.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.080]   - Yeah.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.920]   - Interesting thing.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.760]   - Yeah.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.600]   - I mean, this is what we do.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.560]   We dissect every last thing in these static images.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.960]   And I know it's silly, but it's fun.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.800]   - That's all we have.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.560]   - Julio, if you go to apple.com/newsroom,
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.640]   they have the announcement up there,
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.120]   and it lists some of the things we're gonna see,
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.840]   and including the OS's,
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.680]   they have Siri Kit, HealthKit, and HomeKit right up front.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.520]   - Ah.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.440]   - One of the things I think will be interesting
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.160]   for WWDC is whether we see, you know,
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.680]   Apple so far has put out ARKit,
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.920]   but will they put out an AR development platform?
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.120]   Like something like a motion for AR would
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.040]   explode the usage, you know,
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.200]   if people can actually drag and drop something
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.120]   and build AR solutions.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:26.960]   So here they are. - Right now,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.440]   it's a bit of a lift.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.760]   - Siri Kit, HomeKit, HealthKit, JimKit.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.240]   JimKit.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.400]   - JimKit is what lets you tap your Apple watch against
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.280]   Jim equipment and it automatically sticks to work out.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.360]   - Ah, that's cool.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.880]   Music Kit, ResearchKit, CoreML,
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.360]   that's the machine language stuff, right?
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.640]   Machine learning stuff.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.480]   - Yeah.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.840]   - Not machine language, there is a difference.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.400]   - It's like PDF for machine learning.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.240]   - Yeah.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.360]   Very cool.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.520]   - In your kit.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.440]   - So I guess that means we're gonna have
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.200]   a big keynote on June 4th,
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.280]   and we're still waiting.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.040]   We talked last week about that March rumor
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.560]   that there would be announcements in March.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.320]   As we get now midway through March,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.560]   it gets less likely, right?
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.400]   It looks like maybe we should wait.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.640]   - As soon as they start,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.200]   as soon as it started sounding like the iPads
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.920]   wouldn't be ready in time for March,
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.360]   it makes a March event very hard.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.120]   Like they can still do something like briefings
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.440]   or like again, like a red version of the iPhone or something.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.400]   But if the iPads are going at WWDC,
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.600]   it doesn't sound like there's much use for a full event in March.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.560]   - Right, all right.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.520]   - Big advantage to getting it as close to,
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.520]   announcing them and being able to take pre-orders
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.080]   as close to April as possible,
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.800]   'cause that's when a lot of money gets committed
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.920]   for usage of the year or so.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.000]   - That's also weird to announce the WWDC before an event.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.280]   They did it last time because they were actually
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.120]   moving locations, but typically you wouldn't want
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.920]   to overshadow one event with another.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.880]   - So how did Zach call?
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.280]   This actually looks like it's on the Apple page,
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.120]   this video.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.040]   So maybe they just, maybe they stopped doing that to save,
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.840]   to save bandwidth or something.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.640]   Maybe if you first got there, it was that way.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.560]   - Well, so now to play video,
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.400]   maybe they didn't want to run a while.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.560]   - Otherwise you can have Alex, yeah.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.400]   - That's new right now.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.040]   (laughing)
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.960]   Front page ad blocker.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960]   Let's take a break.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.600]   - Alex could knock that out right now.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.120]   - Yeah, come on Alex, can you get that before you?
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:10.960]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.800]   - I'm working on it.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.640]   - I went to the webpage Safari.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.480]   - You started putting together a slide deck.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.280]   - Maybe Safari, maybe I need to do it in Safari.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.040]   - Yeah, I went there in Safari, you did it right away.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.760]   - Oh, it's a Safari thing.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.840]   You just wouldn't understand.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.760]   - I guess I don't like Chrome.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.840]   - It's working on my Chrome.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.880]   - Oh, why is it?
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.720]   Maybe, oh, you know what?
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.800]   I have all these blockers going.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.120]   It's probably a blocker.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.840]   Steve Gibson is standing there holding it down,
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.880]   preventing it from editing.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.880]   - I have so many blockers on my...
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.720]   Yeah, it's working on,
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.160]   I've got it on Firefox, it's running on fine.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.920]   (snoring)
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.520]   It's just me.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.960]   - Hey, look at Granddad running Chrome.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.120]   - Woo!
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.440]   - Maybe if I turn off my ad blocking.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.440]   - I'm sure it would work in Opera or Sleppnir.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.720]   - Sleppnir, I need to use Sleppnir.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.320]   - Or Fenris, I forget, there's just so many more,
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.960]   nor did it, nor did it.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.320]   - So I don't have the animation.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.160]   - I got links.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.840]   - So open in a purple.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.680]   - It's working in links?
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.640]   - I will say now that I'm watching it on the screen,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.640]   it's quite nice.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.960]   - I know, I want it.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.840]   Let's see, okay.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.680]   - Yeah.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.520]   - I'm gonna-- - Do it on your phone, Leo.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.360]   Do it on your phone.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.200]   - I'm gonna break down and use Microsoft Edge.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.800]   (laughing)
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.160]   - See, unfortunately I'm on--
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.120]   - It'll be so happy that you launched it.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.880]   - And it's being built with service workers, Leo.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.080]   The service workers are down there,
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.240]   building each pixel by hand.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.040]   - I'm embarrassed to say I'm using a Windows machine
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.320]   on a Mac break weekly.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.240]   Now let's see if it, oh, stop it.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.240]   (laughing)
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.920]   - Oh yeah, it works in Edge.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.000]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.200]   Just not on my Chrome,
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.800]   it's probably all the ad blockers I've got.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.640]   - Yeah.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.880]   - That's nice.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.600]   That's really pretty, yeah.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.720]   - It's got a little pop effect too,
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.840]   like it does a little bit of that
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.800]   stretch and bounce stuff,
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.080]   though, seeing classic animation.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.000]   - Actually, you know what it is,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   I have auto play blockers for video on my Chrome
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.920]   because I hate auto play video,
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.400]   and that's obviously what this is.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.240]   Although for-- - It's great.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   - For good, not evil.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.320]   (laughing)
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.920]   - It's for a surprise and delight, not surprise.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.280]   - For surprise and delight.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.120]   - Illustration.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.800]   - Now the question is how many other websites
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.160]   are we gonna see have this design
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.080]   within the next two or three months?
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.120]   Usually, this is how we ended up with the little bubbly,
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.240]   the little shiny bubbles.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.080]   - I know, I know. - Everyone wanted it.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.560]   - Apple is very influential.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.000]   - It's for the little people after last year.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.360]   - I saved on videos on their--
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   - Aqua 2018.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.520]   - It's not web objects, though, probably, right?
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.920]   What was the app-- - Probably HTML.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.920]   - No, that's a video. - No, that's a video.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.920]   - The video tag.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.080]   All right, go ahead, look at the source
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.320]   and we'll get back to you.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.040]   Actually, maybe I can download the QuickTime movie.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.760]   That would be, that's the way to do it.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.760]   A lot of people are saying it's working with Chrome,
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.920]   so it's just my Chrome.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.600]   But I have a lot of stuff.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.080]   Is it CSS transform?
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.440]   - No, I don't know, I'm just talking to someone
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.360]   who's talking to some of the kind of ASCII characters
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.800]   and CSS transform. - Very well be.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.880]   Good, very well be.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.040]   Our show today brought to you by Molecule.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.160]   We got a Molecule running in here.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.920]   Smell how good the air is in here.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.520]   We got the Molecule for the house some months ago.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.640]   I think we're six months in, something like that.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.520]   'Cause Lisa was getting allergies.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.800]   We live in the country and we get a lot of pollen
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.080]   and dust and stuff in the house
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.840]   and she would wake up every morning with a headache
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.160]   and she didn't know what to do,
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.320]   so we got a Molecule.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.520]   The world's first molecular air purifier
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.960]   goes way beyond what a HEPA filter will do.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:25.320]   HEPA filter is basically 1960s technology.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.360]   It's antiquated.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.960]   And actually 1940s, wow 1940s.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.360]   And they're really, until now there hasn't been much
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.040]   innovation since then, but now Molecule uses something
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.040]   called PICO, photo electrochemical oxidation
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.920]   that goes way beyond what a HEPA filter system can do.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.440]   To capture and eliminate allergens.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.840]   Also mold, bacteria, even little things like viruses
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.800]   and airborne chemicals, volatile organic compounds.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.840]   Pollutants a thousand times smaller
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.960]   than those a HEPA filter can capture.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.880]   What we put it in and the next day,
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.400]   well Lisa woke up, no headache
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.400]   and she hasn't had a headache since, except for,
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.080]   and this was actually a kind of good blind test.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.680]   We were away and her nephew was staying in our bedroom
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.520]   and had turned off the Molecule.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.680]   We got home the next morning,
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.560]   she slept in bed in our bed the next morning,
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.680]   she woke up with a headache, she said,
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.680]   what, I got a headache again.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.160]   And we looked in the Molecule but turned off, it works.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.280]   It makes it easier to cope with all kinds of allergies
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.240]   and asthma and significantly reduces symptoms.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.520]   One happy Molecule customer said
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.040]   for the first time in 15 years,
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.440]   she'd been able to breathe through her nose.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.400]   Funded by the EPA research,
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.640]   extensively tested by real people
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.440]   and verified by third parties in university laboratories
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.120]   like the University of South Florida's
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.320]   Center for Biological Defense
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.320]   and the University of Minnesota's
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.040]   Particle Calibration Laboratory.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.560]   We love our Molecule.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.280]   We have it running in the background in silent mode.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.600]   So it's always cleaning the room.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.480]   It's beautiful too, a sleek design,
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   solid aluminum shell,
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.880]   it's kind of the apple of air purifiers.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.960]   And one thing I love,
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.160]   if you don't have to but you compare it to your phone,
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.320]   they have apps on Android and iOS.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.880]   If you pair it to your phone,
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.440]   the Molecule will let your phone know
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   it's that its filters are down like to 85 or 90%.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.920]   And the phone app will order new filters
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.760]   and they just arrive and say,
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.520]   okay here you can put your new filters in.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.200]   It is really cool.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.880]   I really like, yeah, don't need,
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.200]   you don't have to use Wi-Fi,
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.080]   it's not an internet things device.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.080]   You can turn off the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities,
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:40.920]   it works just fine,
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.560]   it's got controls on the top,
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.560]   beautiful controls,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.000]   touch controls on the top.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   But I do, I use the phone app
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.960]   'cause I just like that ability to,
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.520]   you know, automatically get the filters.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.440]   In fact, we just got some.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.680]   And I was ready to put them in
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.360]   and I didn't get around to it that evening,
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.600]   at least I put them in, it's easy.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.440]   Look at this airborne VOC destruction.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.280]   Things like paint fumes,
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.680]   hydrocarbons in the air from gasoline
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   and other poorly combusted fuels.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.440]   From 100% to practically nothing,
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.560]   thanks to the molecule,
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.080]   it's an amazing device, we love it.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.680]   $75 off your first order,
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.320]   we always have a deal for you.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.000]   All you have to do is go to molecule.com
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.240]   and enter the promo code MACBRAKE.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.960]   That's molecule with a K,
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.560]   M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.840]   And the promo code MACBRAKE,
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.880]   I talked to the founders and inventors.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.440]   I was really impressed.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.280]   Great scientists who really wanted to make something
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.080]   that worked for their families.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.040]   Let it work for your family.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.600]   Molecule.com,
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.560]   use a promo code MACBRAKE for $75 off your first order.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.880]   We actually,
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.080]   we bought one in our bedroom.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.280]   We bought one for the studio
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.240]   because we were having problems,
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.160]   they would tar the roof
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.240]   and that would filter right down in here.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:02.360]   And then there was the fires
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.280]   in Sonoma County,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.120]   it was really smokey in here for a while.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.720]   And then we got one for Michael's bedroom too.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.560]   So we got molecules all over.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.960]   We love it.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.800]   All right.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.400]   We got, you got your lapel mic on.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.400]   Now you're very fancy there, Alex Lindsay.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.240]   You got a lot.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.080]   You know.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.920]   You like your Mr. TV show.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.200]   Ah, you know, it's, it's a,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.560]   it's an insert studio.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.800]   What is designed for?
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.000]   So we got one bet.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.840]   Been a lot of time to.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.480]   Is it Alex that bet by June that Apple would cross a trillion?
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.280]   Q1.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.120]   June one.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:39.960]   June one.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.560]   That's, that's Apple's Q3.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.600]   I think so, yeah.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.960]   Or Q4, June, July, August.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.840]   No, Q3.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.440]   What do you think anybody?
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.320]   Will it happen soon?
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.640]   Will it happen at all?
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.040]   World's ninth largest company by revenue.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.520]   It has, it has, I can't keep creeping up.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:58.600]   Let's look at the,
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.560]   let's look at the one year.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.360]   Yes, see, that's some pretty steady upward growth.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.760]   It's not, you know, it's not perfect.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.920]   But if you were to draw a line,
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.640]   you know, March 14th last year was a 138 bucks.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.520]   Now it's at 180 bucks.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.480]   (yawns)
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.040]   I think I could see them.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.880]   Here's a really good one.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.720]   The five year.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.760]   It'll cross and it'll go back down.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.600]   It'll cross again.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.440]   I know.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.880]   Well, people sell off as soon as it gets close, right?
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.520]   There's, you get these sell-offs.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.760]   There'll be a rumor.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.960]   There'll be an event.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.280]   916 billion dollars.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.360]   That's plenty good.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.280]   That's just a odometer number, right?
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.400]   We don't care about this.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.000]   And also, well, yeah, this isn't a sarcastic question,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.960]   but what will it mean when it becomes a trillion dollar
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.200]   company and when it comes to 1.2 trillion dollar company
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.680]   and when it comes to 1.5 trillion dollar companies?
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.040]   I remember it.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.560]   I remember, and I think it might even have been
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:44.440]   while we were doing this show
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.400]   and we were talking about being a $2 billion company.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.720]   From a long way, baby.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   Will they ever sell more than 10 million iPhones?
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.560]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.400]   Right.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.800]   It's kind of more stuff like that.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.880]   Let's talk more about the Eddy Q interview
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.960]   'cause I'm glad to hear you transcribed it.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.920]   This was Eddy at South by Southwest
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.400]   and it was a pretty wide-ranging conversation.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.520]   So Renee, none of us have actually seen it
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.480]   unless you were at South by,
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.360]   but you got a pirated copy of it.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.040]   Yeah, I haven't transcribed all of it.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:17.880]   I listened to all of it,
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.520]   but I only transcribed the part about Texturk.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.920]   That was a part I was super interested in.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.600]   Here's the Apple News story.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.840]   Apple News, according to Eddy Q,
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.440]   Apple News users followed an average
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.920]   of four publications a year ago.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.400]   Now that's up to 20.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.000]   That shows people are using it
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.760]   or they're desperate to just make it work.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.760]   CNN has two video excerpts up now, Leo.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.880]   They have one about Textur and Netflix
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.440]   and I forget what the second one is about,
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.240]   but they have two about two minute long videos up.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.080]   Okay.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.440]   Okay.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.760]   He was asked,
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.400]   so was this a CNN event or just a regular South by event?
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.600]   It was promoted to CNN,
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:55.000]   but Dylan Byers is a CNN post, right?
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.880]   But he does a newsletter.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.360]   And all of the promotions going in the Pacific,
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.640]   which is his new newsletter.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.480]   So I couldn't tell if it wasn't televised
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.640]   because it was a new newsletter event.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.480]   Right.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.800]   It was very strange.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.760]   He said he was asked--
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.840]   It would have been aired in some form.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.920]   Byers asked him about the NRA TV app on Apple TV.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.840]   Q said, "It falls in Apple guidelines today,
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.480]   but if it changes while it's in the app store,
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.320]   it can be removed.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.600]   We also have pro gun control apps in our app store."
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.880]   And of course the app store will buy or sell guns.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.520]   There was a really, really good quote.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.200]   He said, "When they asked them about the difference
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.400]   between Apple News and Google and Facebook,
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.720]   and I'll read a little bit of it
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.560]   because it was super good."
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.680]   He said, "Look, it's always hard to sit from the outside
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.520]   and talk about others.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.640]   I do know that for ourselves, when you got into this,
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.200]   we think you have to have a large platform.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.440]   There's a lot of responsibility.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.560]   We've always taken a great deal of responsibility
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.200]   for our platform starting with iTunes, the music store,
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.080]   the app store, certainly Apple News and podcasts."
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.400]   So he said the ad guidelines,
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.720]   but we weren't happy with the guidelines,
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.880]   but he said, "The other part is that nobody is completely free.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.400]   There is no such thing as free.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.880]   There's no pornography on any of these sites.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.280]   People draw a line and you can decide
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.720]   where you want to draw that line.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.080]   We do think free speech is important,
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.160]   but we don't think white supremacy is free speech.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.600]   That's important."
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:07.600]   - When asked about the Apple original series deals they'd made,
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.000]   he says, "We're all in on entertainment,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.760]   but it's about quality, not quantity."
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.200]   He also said, kind of cryptically,
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.240]   "There's a technology angle that will be a surprise
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.080]   when we add it to our service."
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.440]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.840]   - This is fine. - One of you was talking
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.240]   about how they were gonna surface all of this content
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.160]   and they were thinking of ways.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.120]   - We don't know anything about making television,
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.800]   Eddie says. (laughs)
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.360]   Yep. (laughs)
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.960]   But we did, I took two years when we found the right team
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.800]   to lead the effort.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.520]   Those are the Sony guys that they hired,
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.880]   about 40 people working in original content at Apple right now.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.400]   - The two to eight minutes of video,
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.960]   'cause they asked him, he said the Jeffrey Katz,
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.840]   I think it was Jeffrey Katzmer,
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.240]   who was working on a two to eight minute video service.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.320]   And if that was revolutionary and Eddie responded,
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.520]   that's YouTube, there's nothing new about that.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.360]   - Right.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.560]   - Some shows, some formats are better to have like 30 minutes
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.160]   or 60 minutes or two hours
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.680]   because you can have rich character development
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.080]   and tell more elaborate stories.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.400]   And other things are good for smaller,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.320]   two to eight minute intervals,
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.880]   but he doesn't think one is gonna kill the other.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.280]   - It says, "Car reviews, it's fine,
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.360]   not for what we wanted."
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.480]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.320]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.280]   Remember that Apple rarely comes into a market thinking
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.640]   that we're gonna kill this existing,
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.320]   that this competitor's product,
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.560]   it's basically, well, again, we're not gonna beat,
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.160]   we have a trillion dollars,
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.160]   but we're not gonna beat YouTube
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.360]   but being YouTube because they're doing that extremely well.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.640]   So we're gonna do long form,
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.120]   we're gonna bring people into the house there,
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.880]   and we're making money based on,
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.040]   we can make money based on 30 minute videos,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.000]   we're rasped with Google,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.120]   it's more important for people to be consuming lots
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.280]   and lots and lots of content,
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.840]   'cause more content means more commercial breaks,
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.400]   so to speak.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.480]   - They also said that Apple has the,
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.360]   because Apple's not dependent on advertising revenue,
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.840]   he suggested that Facebook and Google are incentivized
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.200]   to give you more of the same all the time
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.080]   because they're desperate to keep your attention,
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.520]   'cause they want you to watch or to be there
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.840]   for as long as possible,
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.800]   where Apple can do things like show you things
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.400]   that you might not have thought that you'd like,
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.640]   things that are serendipitous,
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.920]   and they're not worried about losing you
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.120]   because they're not making revenue off,
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.320]   keeping you locked on.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.880]   - Yeah, that was one quote that really didn't strike
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.280]   home with me because YouTube, for instance,
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.640]   is all about trying to figure out what you would like
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.120]   to see next to keep you with tuned in.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.160]   Not so much, we're gonna keep loading your screen
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.080]   with crap and more crap and more crap.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:23.120]   YouTube has algorithms down good enough
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.920]   to understand that I started watching a lot of car videos
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.200]   a couple of years ago,
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.920]   but within short order it figured out that,
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.520]   oh, he's not like a big fan of cars and engines.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.840]   He likes engineering.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.760]   He likes shows about people building things
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.920]   and solving problems.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.040]   And so it does recommend interesting engineering solutions
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:42.880]   through cars.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.600]   It will not show me Nurburgring crash videos
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.640]   three times a day.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.240]   So that's one everywhere I did get it.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.440]   - Recommendations are notoriously bad.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:56.360]   Actually, staying up to Ficki had a very good op-ed piece
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.680]   in the New York Times on Sunday,
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.600]   which he said really, it's been her experience
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.560]   that YouTube gets more extreme.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.200]   So if you watch left-wing videos,
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.400]   you're gonna end up getting recommendations
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.080]   for conspiratorial podcasts and videos
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.520]   about secret government agencies
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.560]   and the 911 theories.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.800]   If you watch right-wing stuff,
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.320]   you're gonna get more and more extreme
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.160]   right-wing stuff.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.960]   And I kind of agree with her
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.360]   that the algorithm seems to,
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.200]   this is her quote,
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.920]   I've concluded that people are drawn to content
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.560]   that is more extreme than what they started with.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.400]   It certainly is one.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.200]   - It's too busy to mistake-y.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.440]   - Yeah, it's certainly one way to get people to watch more
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.760]   is to kind of ramp it up.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.680]   And it certainly explains why the content on YouTube
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.280]   is increasingly extreme.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.760]   You look at people like Logan Paul,
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:45.360]   they just have to go farther and farther each video.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.720]   I don't know if there's,
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.000]   but the problem is YouTube doesn't reveal its algorithm
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.840]   and this can only be an anecdote.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.760]   - I think we've been talking about that.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.000]   I think we've been talking about media
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.400]   but giving more and more extreme since reality TV start.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.800]   - Yeah, sensationalism is nothing new to do on television.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.560]   - It'll start with Morton Downey Jr.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.520]   - Well, since they take journalism.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.520]   - And yellow journalism.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.440]   - And more than newspapers, you're right.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.200]   - And I think that as far as the algorithms go,
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.240]   I mean, what I'm amazed at,
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.360]   I'm almost never touched by them.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.120]   Like I go in to look for something and I go watch it
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.400]   and then I leave.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.560]   And so it's very rare for me to,
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.560]   I mean, with YouTube TV, I might leave it on a lot
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.480]   because it's just on and then it's like a TV
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:24.320]   in the background.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.720]   But with YouTube itself, I'm there to find something.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.120]   My kids on the other hand, I watch them,
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.640]   they can watch Saturday morning for two or three hours
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.440]   and all they're doing is autoplay.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.000]   Like they just sit there and they just,
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.960]   it just plays one video after the other
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.520]   and they sit there and they,
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.640]   and I would interrupt them,
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.560]   but most of it is like how to build stuff
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.480]   and educational stuff like for a side,
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.800]   I walked in on Saturday morning
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.240]   and they're watching breakdowns of how DNA is created
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.280]   and how it separates in it's RNA and everything else.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.520]   And I was like, yeah, they can keep on watching
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.360]   not if they want.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.920]   So, but they, I'm surprised at how long they can just sit there
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.400]   and they don't ever touch the controller.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.320]   They just sit there and just let it just kind of drone along.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.000]   It's on Apple TV and so it's not,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.120]   it's probably more difficult for them
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.120]   to find something new anyway.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:11.120]   - Technology says that EQ in and of itself is not for good.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.480]   The people that make technology have to make it for good.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.680]   Okay.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.160]   A lot of what he said, very on point.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.560]   You know, he's an Apple executive.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:23.520]   He's not gonna wander off the reservation.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.840]   He did mention the heart study with the Apple Watch
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.680]   which we talked about last week.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.760]   That's pretty cool.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.600]   There will be a new medical records feature
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:36.240]   in iOS 11.3 and new Apple Watch activity rings.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.800]   - Activity rings?
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.640]   - New rings.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.480]   - Congratulations.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.480]   - I was able to like a ring.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.200]   - No, not that kind of ring.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.360]   The, you know, the circles.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.640]   - There was a whole product line I was missing.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.480]   - Yeah.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.320]   Yeah, the circles.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.360]   As for Apple Music, he says,
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   we have 38 million subscribers, 8 million trial users.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.720]   So they're creeping up.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.160]   They're getting bigger and bigger.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.520]   38 million is not, is a significant number at this point.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.360]   - Yep.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.160]   - I think Spotify's 71 million, right?
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:13.240]   Do we, do you remember the time when the record industry
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.120]   said they weren't gonna make any money from subscriptions?
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.840]   'Cause I remember them talking about that.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:17.680]   - Yes.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.440]   (laughs)
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.920]   - And they just couldn't get their head around the idea
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.320]   that well, everyone's gonna be subscribing
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.320]   and then you'll make money at it.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.120]   And it really is, it's a,
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.120]   it's like, I think it's like,
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.400]   oh, it's well over 50% of the revenue now.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.160]   - Actually, there's a great article in the Daily Dot today
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.800]   on hacking Spotify's playlist and actually pay for play.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.920]   Plug Ola is back, even though it's against the rules
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.400]   in Spotify, a lot of artists are now finding influencers
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.880]   and paying to get on their playlists.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.680]   That's a very effective way.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.320]   Remember, Alex, you worked as a music director,
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.920]   how they would come to you and say,
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.800]   if you were to play our record in high rotation,
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.240]   it could be worth your while.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.480]   That's what's called Plug Ola.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.240]   It was a big problem, it's illegal,
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.400]   and it was a big problem in the music,
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.440]   in the radio industry.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.880]   I think maybe Spotify's got a Plug Ola problem.
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.680]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that what they really need to do
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.760]   is figure out a way that the folks making the playlists
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.880]   where it would be able to make some money on it.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.280]   I mean, I think that they should be getting
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.960]   enumerated for the influence that they're providing.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.320]   So when you don't do that,
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.800]   you're creating an environment for that to happen.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.680]   So them getting some small percentage,
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.440]   I mean, if they have 100,000 people downloading,
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.880]   and people are watching or X number of downloads,
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.120]   they should be getting some kind of money
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.360]   because they're providing the service
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.080]   that the record company would otherwise.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.040]   - Which record company is obviously willing,
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.680]   and the artists are willing to pay for?
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.480]   - Well, here's the quote from the Daily Dot,
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.880]   the black market for Spotify playlists is booming.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.400]   It's cheaper than you might expect to hack the system,
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.400]   and if it's done right, it more than pays for itself.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.400]   So I know we've always said that artists
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.920]   don't get much money from streaming,
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.160]   but they're getting enough to where they're starting to cheat it.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:00.680]   - Yeah, and I think that,
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:04.800]   there's a couple of things that Spotify could do
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.320]   that would allow people to basically build radio shows
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.800]   that incorporated the music,
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.480]   where they're not actually streaming them,
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.360]   they're just simply being able to talk between them
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.280]   and then play and do those kinds of things,
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.040]   and allowing them to do advertising,
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.080]   and they get to run their own ads,
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   on their show, on Spotify,
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.400]   would definitely basically be the end of radio.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.520]   I mean, that would be,
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.120]   like if you were able to actually do a show
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.720]   where it's more than your playlist,
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.600]   you're able to talk in between and have a bunch of things,
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.680]   it would, there'd be,
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.240]   yeah, why would you listen to radio at that point?
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.080]   - Yeah.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.200]   - Well, that's part of the problem.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.280]   Just as we're starting to see TV shows
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.960]   trending more towards nostalgia,
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.960]   we're seeing movies that got canceled in the 90s
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.360]   being revived because it's the people who were kids
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.160]   who grew up on those shows who are still watching television,
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.840]   were us people who,
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.480]   they're people who did not grow up in the habit
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.080]   of turning on the TV and just letting things play.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.240]   So that's gonna change radio.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.640]   We already seen why--
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.480]   - They already have--
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.320]   - It's a really good experience.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:12.160]   - I'd say that's why conservative talk radio
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.160]   really, really took off,
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.320]   because again, it's mostly old people
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.440]   who are listening to radio,
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.120]   and people who are very susceptible to,
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.880]   the world out there is scary,
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.720]   you don't understand it,
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.040]   and it's full of danger that you can't combat,
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.520]   please, buy our vitamin supplements.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.280]   - Here's the example, rap caviar.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:32.000]   This is a playlist on Spotify that has 8 million followers.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.160]   60 songs, so if you get on this playlist, that's huge.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.120]   You're gonna, people are gonna hear your song.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.920]   - Is it one playlist that they're just constantly refining?
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:42.920]   - Yeah. - Or they're constantly--
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.160]   - Yeah, so it's exactly what you were talking about.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.360]   It's like a radio station, doesn't have a DJ,
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.720]   but if you follow this playlist,
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.360]   it's updated all the time,
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:53.440]   and if you could get on this playlist somehow,
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:54.520]   that would be really good.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.520]   8 million people would be likely to hear your song,
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.800]   you'd get 8 million streams, that pays for itself.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.880]   - Yeah, it's hard, we gotta find a balance point for it,
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.200]   it's Instagram, I think, shows the way of,
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:11.040]   we have people who started out creating Instagram feeds
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.000]   based on their interests, based on fun,
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.480]   they wake up one morning and find if they have
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.160]   half a million subscribers,
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:20.160]   and if someone offers you $5,000 to mention a product,
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.320]   well, of course, you're going to take it,
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.200]   because most of us come from immigrant parents
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.800]   and grandparents who would rise from their graves
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.080]   and kill us, if we could make $5,000 as much money
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.560]   as they spend in their first homes
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.920]   by doing exactly 18 seconds worth of work.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.000]   And the other end of that is that,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.920]   remember that if you created a Spotify playlist
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.480]   that a million people are interested in,
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.040]   you are working for Spotify, you're just not getting paid for it,
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.920]   so there has to be a way of getting,
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:48.000]   of when your hobby becomes profitable for other people,
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.040]   you need to have your thumb in the till.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.880]   - Alex, you remember?
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:52.520]   - No, you just need to be able to,
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.840]   you remember the loop in Chicago,
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.960]   one of the great classic rock stations of all time.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.640]   My friend, Steve Dahl.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:00.880]   - Steve Dahl shows.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:04.640]   - His last show on the loop.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.480]   - Hello, really?
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.320]   - Hey there.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.080]   - The loop is shutting down and going Christian rock.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.640]   - You could have caught having sex with a porn star or something.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.400]   - This is what's happening.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.720]   Radio stations are struggling.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.000]   The radio company I work for, Cleared Channel,
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.480]   they syndicate my tech guy show, Chapter 11,
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.360]   Cumulus, which owned the loop, struggling.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.160]   I think they also declared bankruptcy.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.080]   - Well, I know you've got to blame,
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.400]   you've got to think that it's digital, it's Spotify,
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.600]   it's other ways to get music, right?
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.080]   I hope it's podcast too.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:46.600]   - Well, I think that that is definitely,
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:50.120]   radio is definitely on its last leg.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:50.960]   I don't think that there's any--
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.800]   - That's streaming, right?
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.840]   - Yeah, but I think that the people,
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:59.840]   I still think what radio leaves when radio goes away,
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.760]   which is going to do,
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.840]   as my parents don't even listen to radio anymore.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.520]   So, as it goes away,
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.560]   I think the void that's still left that isn't being solved
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.280]   by Spotify or Apple Music is still contextual information.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.000]   So how do I, for instance, a good example is even NPR,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.360]   I listen to NPR every day.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.320]   I never listen to it on the radio ever,
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.160]   because I would never want to listen to it
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.760]   in the order that they gave it to me.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.680]   I'm on the NPR app and I get morning edition and--
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.280]   - I listen to talk. - Whatever I miss.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.120]   - Yeah, talk has survived,
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.160]   although I think podcasting is assaulting talk as well.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.520]   - What I was going to say is that I reorder all the shows
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:39.360]   and then I listen to it,
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.240]   but I still want to listen to what people have to say.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.160]   I think that-- - That's what the--
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.400]   - I think there are-- - Absolutely.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.160]   But I think that there are people who want to listen to music
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.800]   and understand, like, if there are shows that had,
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:53.640]   you know, interviews with some of the artists and so on and so forth,
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.480]   I think some of the people who are really big fans
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.960]   would really like that.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.880]   There's just no good, easy way to do that
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:58:59.960]   inside of these platforms.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.080]   And I think that's something that radio hasn't done
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:02.920]   for a long time.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.320]   I mean, ever since they went to programmed music,
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.960]   you almost never get actual interviews with the bands anyway.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.720]   I mean, you have a handful of holdovers,
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:15.240]   like KBCO and Boulder, that still has, you know,
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.720]   Studio C and still has, you know, a lot of those things.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.880]   And I think that's what makes them relevant.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.440]   I think that if they're not doing something different,
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.880]   if you're just doing program radio,
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.920]   why would I listen to that?
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.040]   You know, like Pandora does that.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:28.920]   So if you're just doing, you know,
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.440]   and it does it better for me than a radio station,
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.160]   you have to figure out how that radio station
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.680]   is gonna provide something that's distinct or Spotify
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.720]   to close the loop, has to figure out how to reproduce
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:43.080]   those last little vestiges that wouldn't be hard for them to do
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.600]   and wouldn't take away from their business
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.920]   to probably just add another couple million listeners.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   - According to WLP.com, the loop lives on,
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:55.400]   it's not digital. I mean, if you're gonna do a radio station,
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.320]   why have a tower anyway, right?
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:58.960]   - Well, the hardest part is all the,
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.440]   the licensing for the music is the hardest part
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.000]   of why people don't go online.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.840]   You know what I mean?
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.880]   It does not, the math that they created
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.800]   doesn't make any sense.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.080]   That's why we don't have radio stations that are,
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.840]   radio, if you're an existing radio station
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.480]   and you're streaming, your licensing is completely different
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.040]   than if you're streaming only.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.440]   - Let's see.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.080]   Let me take a break and we'll have more in just a second,
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.820]   lots more stories, AirPods 2 perhaps.
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.880]   New entry level Mac Notebook, perhaps.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.300]   I love all these rumors.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:38.200]   A new Apple keyboard that can't be defeated by crumbs,
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.680]   perhaps that will be welcome.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.760]   - That's a pad.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.800]   I mean, the iPad Pro keyboard is like that already.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.640]   - Yeah.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.480]   - It's here behind the app.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.880]   - They need to implement soon.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.840]   I hear so many people losing their 2016 Mac books
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.440]   because they're very fragile with something.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.880]   - Well, so that's the hilarious thing
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.160]   is that that keyboard was designed to prevent ingress
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.320]   from particles, but the problem is that they still get in
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.160]   and now they get out.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.160]   - Prevent egress.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.440]   (laughing)
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.400]   - As far as- - Progress, progress either.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.240]   - As far as I'm concerned, that's like taking a dog
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.640]   that pees all over the house and saying,
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.160]   "Good news, we trained it not to drink out of the toilet."
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.080]   Okay, it's an improvement.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.600]   Where's he still going to the pound bar, but okay.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.560]   - Show today brought to you by FreshBooks,
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.040]   the cloud accounting system for freelancers
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.880]   who want to spend more time doing what they love
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.860]   and less time creating invoices, tracking expenses,
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:30.840]   pestering, slow pays, FreshBooks is awesome.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.560]   Tax season's coming and I bet you,
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.520]   as we get closer to tax season,
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.360]   a few of you are saying,
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.640]   I wish I'd started using FreshBooks last year.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.400]   Now's the time, start using it this year
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.080]   for next year's tax season.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.600]   FreshBooks gives you all the information,
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.120]   your bookkeeper, your tax preparer, or you,
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.200]   if you're doing it yourself needs, to do your taxes.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.120]   But more than that, every day of the year,
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.160]   you'll know, have I made money?
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.240]   Who owes me money?
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.000]   How much money's come in?
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.160]   It's a great dashboard.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.600]   It starts by making professional looking invoices.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.960]   That's how I started using FreshBooks.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.760]   It solved my invoice phobia.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.320]   I was able to get them out in time.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.880]   And by the way, here's something interesting.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.840]   You get paid faster if you send invoices.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.320]   Save time accepting credit cards online with FreshBooks
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.240]   and those online credit card payments,
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.560]   which by the way, you get immediately
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.120]   as soon as you sign up for FreshBooks.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.760]   I mean, your client is more likely to pay quickly.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.520]   On average, according to FreshBooks, twice as fast.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.880]   Plus, you don't have to go to the bank with the checks.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.640]   You don't have to chase clients for payments.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.280]   You'll always know which invoices have been sent,
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.120]   which have been paid, which haven't been paid,
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.920]   which have been viewed and not paid.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.920]   It's easy to send out gentle and increasingly annoying
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.920]   notices.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.760]   You owe me money.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.760]   Send me money.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.640]   But you're not gonna need to,
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.360]   'cause people pay faster with FreshBooks.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.160]   It's a lot easier for them and it's a lot easier for you.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.920]   FreshBooks always adds new features too,
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.480]   but it started with the invoices.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.800]   But of course, in the process of doing invoices,
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.880]   then you're doing expenses in their TNA
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.880]   or just the expenses by clicking a picture in your app,
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.920]   FreshBooks app on your iPhone or Android phone.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.760]   And then it goes into the FreshBooks invoice,
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.880]   but you also, that's capturing expenses.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.160]   So now you know income, you know expenses,
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.000]   you can do, you know how much money you've made.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.400]   You have a dashboard that really has all the information
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.840]   you need, including all the reports you'll need
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.840]   for tax time and accountants whenever you need them.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.280]   FreshBooks makes it easy to build for time and hours.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.160]   You could do it by client or even by project
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.200]   and have different prices for different projects
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.840]   with the same client.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.640]   There's multilingual, multi-currency support
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.080]   that just added Spanish and Dutch languages.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.880]   And they have all the currencies in there.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.000]   That's one of the reasons I used it.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   I was billing them in Canada.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.560]   It made it a lot easier to bill them in Canadian dollars.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.800]   Payment schedules can be set up from the FreshBooks iOS app.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.120]   So you can see, and you can now see attachments
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.400]   if you've made proposals on existing proposals.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.640]   They've got a very rich array
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.960]   of push notifications on iOS.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.680]   So you can be, for instance, notified
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.480]   when a client hasn't viewed the invoice.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.120]   Hey, you know, you sent that invoice last week,
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.160]   nobody's looked at it.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.800]   When a client comments,
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.120]   when an invoice is overdue, lots more.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.400]   Set yourself up for a stress-free tax season
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.360]   next year with FreshBooks.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.200]   You've been meaning to do it,
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.080]   now's the time to do it.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.400]   So you'll be ready for next April.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.040]   From payment reminders to late fees,
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.400]   automate as much or as little as you'd like to
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.080]   and get back to doing what you love at FreshBooks.

[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.720]   Make sure you tell them, "I heard it on FreshBooks."
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.320]   I mean, I heard it on the MacBreak.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.440]   If you say, "I heard it on FreshBooks,"
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.440]   it's not gonna do any good.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.560]   Say, "I heard it on MacBreak,"
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.400]   when they ask you how did you hear about it?
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.400]   FreshBooks.com/MacBreak.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.920]   30 days free with thank-up so much
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.040]   for their support at MacBreak Weekly.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.760]   So that patent isn't a man of from heaven
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.920]   when it comes to the crummy keyboards
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.240]   on the new Mac Notebooks.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.560]   That's just a patent, not a fix.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.520]   - I don't think anyone wants
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.760]   crumbless keyboards higher than list.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.040]   They just want the old keyboard.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.960]   - Or just make it easy to fix.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.960]   - Yeah.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.840]   A new keyboard would be great.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.280]   We're still seeing rumors.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.120]   Here's a new one from MacRumors,
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.960]   new entry-level Mac Notebook,
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.720]   expected to adopt retina display,
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.040]   likely launch at WWDC in June.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.320]   Oh, I hope, I hope.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.400]   This is from Digitimes, which is,
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.800]   I don't know, what about 50/50?
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.560]   I don't know how accurate Digitimes is,
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:35.560]   but they say a new 13.3-inch entry-level MacBook.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.280]   We're on the second MacBook,
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.880]   but they haven't really changed it much, have they?
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.720]   I'd love to see another one.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.080]   - No, I mean, and I think the wish was that
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.360]   the MacBook 12-inch would fall down
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.920]   to the $999 price point
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:49.040]   and replace the MacBook Air,
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.560]   the way the MacBook Air replaced the previous white MacBook,
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.680]   but that just never happened.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.760]   It remained an expensive product to make,
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.960]   and the Intel Core M processor remained suboptimal
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.120]   for a lot of tasks that you want
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.600]   in a general purpose computer.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.880]   And so the Air stayed because it had a real core,
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.920]   i5 or i7 processor, had a bunch of ports,
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.480]   had a lot of things that people find useful
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.320]   at that price point.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.800]   And it had that price point.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.760]   And I think Apple has realized that they painted themselves
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.400]   into a MacBook corner the way they painted themselves
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.080]   into a Mac Pro corner.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.160]   And a modernized Air is probably a better product
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.040]   at that price range.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.160]   - So yeah, I'm not clear if this is an Air or a MacBook.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.560]   They're saying MacBook.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.360]   It is a 13.3-inch panel,
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.440]   and it's the same resolution.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.800]   Now they would probably know this
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.880]   'cause they're in the supply chain business, right?
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.800]   Digitimes.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:40.560]   So a 13.3-inch ASI panel,
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.440]   same size and resolution as the MacBook Pro,
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.560]   2560 by 1600 from LG.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.360]   It says LG will begin supplying the panel in April.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:55.800]   So Digitimes, I think, is then projecting
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.420]   mass production end of May or beginning of June.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.400]   I'm not just, it's not clear,
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.160]   is that for a refreshed MacBook Air?
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.560]   - And when you look at the KGI rumors,
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.760]   and you look at Mark Gurman's rumors,
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.560]   and you look at the stuff that Ben Behren spoke about,
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.400]   it all makes sense.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.760]   Apple needs something at the 8.99 price point
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:14.640]   to sort of compete with the growing windows,
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.080]   entry-level computers there.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.440]   And they don't have anything but an outdated MacBook Air
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.960]   in an expensive MacBook.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.960]   And they need something in the middle
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.720]   and a linear successor to the MacBook Air
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:27.160]   with a retina display in modern specs is their best bet.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.720]   - Right.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.520]   The question is, are they gonna keep the MacBook Air name
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.320]   because as Renee says,
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.000]   it's a weird problem that they have
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   that if they're really gonna do an entry-level MacBook,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.680]   if they want, and if they're trying to compete
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.880]   with Windows machines,
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.800]   they have to offer a hell of a lot more
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.280]   than the MacBook Nothing,
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:50.000]   which is one of my favorite Mac products ever.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.440]   But if you're anticipating that someone is gonna be
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:58.120]   walking into Best Buy or someone with a $600
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.360]   to $900 to spend on a laptop,
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.080]   you show them the current MacBook Nothing,
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.920]   you show them what you can get on the Windows side,
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.200]   same as basically the same sort of usage.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.960]   You get so much more on the Windows side.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.240]   People, you don't have to travel with dongles
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.280]   and yes, it's thicker, but not so much thicker
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.840]   that it's gonna, you're gonna have to throw away
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.600]   one of the magazines you're not reading
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.480]   in your backpack anymore.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.600]   So the question is, are they gonna try to create a more,
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.600]   are they gonna try to create a MacBook Nothing
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.960]   that is cheaper to manufacture?
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.160]   Or are they gonna go, for instance,
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.840]   the way of one of the original white MacBooks
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.760]   where they bite the bullet, say,
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.080]   we're gonna have to have a plastic case,
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.840]   we're gonna have to make it thicker than the MacBook Pro
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.520]   because we can't afford what would cost us
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.280]   to manufacture something as thin as an iPad at this scale.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.280]   And we also need to have a couple of for real USB
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.720]   type A ports on there.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.240]   So it's, it will give us a lot of insight
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.720]   into what Apple's worried about.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.080]   If they decide to make something that is a less,
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.120]   a more affordable MacBook Nothing,
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.880]   that means that they're saying we get it,
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.360]   we're not, we just can't do what the Windows manufacturers
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.640]   are doing based on their lower overheads,
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.240]   based on their need to keep revolutionizing their line
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.560]   year after year after year.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.800]   Or they're gonna say, no, we do want to get
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.480]   that high school student, we do wanna get that college student,
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.800]   we do wanna get that company that's buying things
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.120]   in bulk for all of their, for in a hundred copies
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.520]   for each of their employees.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.360]   I don't know how they would do it.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.880]   - And remember when they announced the new MacBook Pro
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.200]   they positioned the entry level version without a touch bar
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.920]   is for everyone who wanted a MacBook Air with retina.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.920]   But that, you know, that really that's 12,
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.320]   that's 1299 I think point of entry.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.240]   And the MacBook I think was originally gonna be
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.400]   the MacBook Stealth and wasn't meant to be an entry level
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.480]   machine, it was meant to be again, that executive,
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.440]   sort of I want the ultra lightest MacBook possible.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.760]   And nothing is fulfilling that entry level product slot
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.840]   for them.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.680]   - Yeah.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.400]   - The retina resolution to be really important.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.400]   If it's possible, there's a lot of apps that I literally
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.720]   can't run on some of the smaller app.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.320]   There's a sun number resolution.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.400]   So being able to have more resolution on the screen,
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.480]   even if it be hard to read would be useful.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.480]   - You can buy non-retina displays that don't have the
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.680]   the quality and the calibration that they,
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.000]   that color calibration that Apple would need
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   or the brightness they would need.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.560]   So that we're, there are still plants
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:18.960]   who are making super, super cheap,
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.920]   non-retina type displays.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.120]   And if you're making a kind of display that needs to go
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.200]   into a MacBook, then you're really still talking about
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.160]   one of the price your display is on the, on the market.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.400]   So it would be, it would be hard for them to even do
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.880]   something like a MacBook Air right now, I think.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.960]   - I'm getting a Windows laptop.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.000]   Should probably say that it's 12 inches.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.040]   I'm just checking the, this is the new age.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.880]   - Is it the one with the camera and the key?
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.920]   The other one with those.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.960]   - That was funny, wasn't it?
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.960]   This is 1920 by 1280 on a 12 inch laptop,
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.040]   pound and a half tablet with, you know,
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.720]   attachable keyboard, Windows style.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.120]   - That, this is three by two, which is kind of interesting.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:00.960]   - Yeah.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.960]   - So, I don't know, I'll have that next week.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.520]   - I'll show you what you just said.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.200]   - It's hard to, when you look at HP's product,
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.520]   especially when you look at Lenovo's product line,
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.200]   that's what they're up against when they're trying to deal
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.360]   with a thousand bucks or less.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.920]   We're not talking about,
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.760]   - This is 1000 bucks.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.680]   - Yeah, we're talking about really good machines.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.360]   I think that, I don't think that a ThinkPad would cause
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.720]   people who are happy with a MacBook to switch,
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.400]   or even people who have complaints about the MacBook to switch.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   But I think it's useful to walk into a store
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.680]   and check out a ThinkPad,
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.600]   because these things are,
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.680]   they're really like the Crown Vic,
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.200]   with the Crown Vic is the cars,
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.880]   meaning they're not necessarily stealthy or elegant,
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.920]   but damn do they perform.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.720]   And damn, are they handy to have around.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.800]   - It'd be so nice to see some of these models.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:52.040]   And maybe it's just Alex's thought that Apple should just
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.080]   allow Mac OS to be sold on other platforms,
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.680]   'cause I don't expect Apple to make 1500 different SKUs.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.800]   This is not in there,
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.000]   they're not gonna ever make anything that looks like this,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.480]   but it's a touchscreen,
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.640]   if it just weren't running Windows.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.480]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.320]   - It was so great.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.360]   - Right, no, there's so many things that I would love
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.960]   to see Apple, I mean,
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.760]   there's so many PCs that we have in the office
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.480]   that are much more powerful than,
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.360]   I mean, I haven't tested the iMac Pro yet,
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.920]   but some of the PCs that we have
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.480]   have four graphics cards in them,
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.840]   and they have an incredible,
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.840]   the AMD Threadrippers are pretty fast CPUs.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.880]   And all of those things are things that you really wanna see,
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.040]   you wanna have that hardware,
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.880]   and then you just wanna have it on a Mac OS.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.720]   I think that,
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.040]   I do think that Apple's gonna hang on to it
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.560]   until they've decided that the portable platform,
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.200]   at least, is going to support mostly iOS.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.080]   I mean, I think that the two operating systems
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.040]   are slowly merging.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.880]   The real question is whether they can without
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.840]   exposing anything.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.680]   - Yeah.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.200]   - There's some point where Mac OS is not gonna be valuable
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.040]   to Apple.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.040]   You know, I don't know what that is.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:09.040]   - Again, I'm still yearning to see visible all in,
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.160]   and all inside that Apple is as much in love with Mac OS
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.360]   as they are with what they're doing with iOS.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.400]   And as I've said before,
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.400]   but I haven't said it in a couple months,
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.000]   we'll say it again.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.080]   I'm taking really good care of my 2015 MacBook Pro
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:24.600]   because when it dies,
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.680]   when I finally spill Dr. Pepper into the keyboard of this one,
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:33.000]   if Apple has not take enough real major turn away
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.760]   from the direction they're headed with the Mac books,
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.000]   I will not find other Mac book.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.400]   It will be definitely a think-pad.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.200]   There's no way they're gonna buy a current MacBook Pro.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.120]   - Just because everybody's deleting the bezels
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.160]   and adding a notch, right?
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.160]   - Just because everybody in the Mac space
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.200]   probably isn't aware of what's going on in the window space.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.200]   This is the $1,000 HP Spectre.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.960]   I5, 8 gigs of RAM, it's got a touch screen.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.400]   This is $1,000, it's 13 inches.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:04.000]   This is kind of what that MacBook,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.880]   that $1,000 MacBook would be competing against.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.720]   - Yeah.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.880]   And the great thing is you don't get crumbs in
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.040]   that not only is it a better keyboard,
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:10.960]   you don't get crumbs in it
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.640]   because if you're watching YouTube and Netflix,
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.040]   you have to just fold the screen back
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.160]   so that the keyboard is facing away from your mouth.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.000]   (laughing)
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.200]   - On the table, it's covered in popcorn.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.560]   - Well, don't do that.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.600]   Yeah, that's what I mean.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.280]   - If there's one thing that I would love for them to steal,
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.600]   Apple to steal, it's not even necessarily a touchscreen.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.280]   It is a 108, it is that 360 degree hinge
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.080]   because the number, when I'm testing out
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.040]   at a Windows laptop, the number of times that I find myself,
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.320]   again, turning it all the way around
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.160]   and turning it into, not even there to touch the screen,
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.600]   I just want to be able to read stuff
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.760]   while I'm having lunch or even I want to.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.160]   I'm traveling, I have to crank out like 5,000 words a day
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.120]   for three or four days while I'm traveling
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.680]   and I really want to do it on something better
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.560]   than a notebook keyboard
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.680]   so I will travel with a really good keyboard.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.640]   It adds so much nice stuff to the experience
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.480]   of using a computer.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.680]   I would love to see that.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:10.440]   - I think I'm more likely to get the iPad version
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.400]   of the Clamshell first.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:17.400]   They'll just scale iOS to be a MacBook device
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.760]   and it's a much more keyboard
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:19.960]   or maybe it'll have it a touchable keyboard
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.640]   but it'll be much more MacBook-like
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:22.920]   and that solves the problem of touchscreen,
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.240]   it solves the problem of LTE modems.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.480]   It just solves a lot of the issues
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.160]   that people currently have with MacBooks
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.000]   although with a different operating.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.680]   - So everything that Apple announced last fall
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.320]   has shipped except for one thing.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.960]   Can anybody tell me what that one thing is?
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.600]   We got the HomePod finally, right?
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.440]   - Two things.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.440]   - Two things?
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.280]   - Yep.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.120]   - I only think about one.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.840]   - I cloud message sync and AirPlay too.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.280]   - Oh, those charging, charging, charging, packing.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.360]   - Three things.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.520]   - The three things Apple announced in the fall.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.840]   - Three things?
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.840]   - Okay, anybody else?
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.160]   Anybody that went on four?
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.000]   Anybody four?
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.640]   - The AirPods, the AirPods charging case.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.320]   - AirPods charging case that goes with this
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.920]   which rumor says, rumor says the digital,
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.040]   this is digit times again.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.000]   We'll see this month, finally the charging pad
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.480]   and of course the picture Apple showed
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.760]   has an iPhone and Apple watch charging
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.480]   along with your AirPods but you can't charge AirPods
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:18.240]   unless you get a new case that supports wireless charging.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.560]   - This is one of the few Apple products I can tell you
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.760]   that I'm zero interested.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.920]   Like it doesn't happen very often.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.440]   It doesn't happen very often.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.280]   I'm usually like, just send me, like,
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.760]   Apple just had a subscription service
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.200]   that I just send them a check when they have a new product.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.040]   - You've done that, I know.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:34.880]   - And I get it.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.000]   It would probably be fine.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:37.840]   But, but.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.120]   - Not this one, huh?
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.000]   - Not this one because here's the deal
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.160]   is that I want to know that it's really going to charge.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.760]   I mean, I don't know how many times your watch has been,
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.920]   like you put your watch, I've wanted my car.
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.960]   And what happened is it pops off just a little bit
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.960]   because of that mag, you know,
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.000]   and I'm afraid that that would happen all the time.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.920]   And I want to have, I wish I had a lightning in my watch.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.440]   You know, like I don't like the whole magnet thing.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.320]   You know, the only place I like the magnet is the Magla,
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.880]   or is the Mag safe, which they took away.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.880]   Not that I'm bitter.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:09.320]   - Do you, you don't do wireless charging on your iPhone?
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.160]   - Never.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.000]   - Never. I do every night.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.240]   - I wanna plug it in, I wanna plug it in.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.080]   I wanna know it's there.
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.560]   I just wanna, I wanna hear the little,
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.520]   I wanna hear the little,
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.920]   I won't even use a charger button cable
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.680]   that doesn't make a little click when you put it in.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.520]   - I wanna know that I--
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.600]   - Use it for, actually get charged.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.160]   - The best way to charge your iPhone is still to use,
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:26.680]   like the slow adapter and to do it with a plug
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.160]   because that does the least cycles
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.360]   and maintains battery health the longest.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.640]   The convey, like fast charging and wireless charging
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:33.480]   are conveniences.
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.000]   Like if you have a fast charging,
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.680]   you need your phone topped up quickly,
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.200]   or you just have it in the kitchen or your desk
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.160]   and you want to charge it quickly for a few minutes.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.920]   But both of those take lifespan off your battery.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.280]   - I don't think most humans should ever have to care about that.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.560]   But if you're someone who likes to micromanage your charge cycles,
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.880]   you still wanna go with slow and wired.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.080]   - I don't like charge pads that are flat like this
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.640]   'cause I do find that that is a little bit more difficult
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.600]   to be sure that you're charging on them.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.440]   As you know, I use an easel charger,
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.920]   which works perfectly as long as it's on the easel,
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.640]   anywhere on the easel, it's always charging
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.640]   and that's what I use at night.
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.800]   But I imagine there'll be people,
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.080]   I mean, there is a convenience
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.800]   to having all three things charged.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.400]   You know, maybe for travel, this would be the right thing.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.520]   - Yeah, also Apple's done a,
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.880]   it looks like they've done a really good job
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:15.800]   on the interface for this.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.360]   There's not on my old Samsung phone,
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.320]   the last time I was using a wireless charger
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.840]   on my nightstand every single day,
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.760]   there's like a little dot, little LED that sort of comes on
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.560]   that reaffirms that yes, I'm charging right now,
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.640]   whereas Apple, the iPhone is actually gonna take over
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.840]   your screen for a second with a cool little animation
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.280]   that's impossible to skip, to show you,
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.200]   to overlook that yes, you've made it correct.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.080]   I do think that the best way to do this though,
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:45.040]   is not like one expensive super duper charger,
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.240]   but I think the real power wireless charging comes
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.200]   when you have affordable chargers that are kind of everywhere.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.800]   Like right now, I'm at the desk that I podcast from,
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.520]   again, back when my daily carry phone
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.800]   was head wireless charging,
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   there'd just be like a $15 eBay wireless charger right here.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.640]   So when I put it down, it's charging,
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.880]   there used to be one on the little stand
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.720]   that I have my drink on when I'm watching TV,
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.040]   it just happens to go down there.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.520]   Not that I'm, it's not even an explicit thing,
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.920]   I'm just simply setting it down where the phone belongs.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.200]   And as a result, I'm not grabbing my phone to go out at night
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.720]   and realize that, oh, that's right, 8% phone, yeah.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.680]   Too bad.
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.240]   - So I don't see the, it's called the air power,
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.200]   is that what that pad is?
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.280]   I don't see it on the Apple site,
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:32.160]   but they did show it right at that event.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.920]   - Yep. - Yeah.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.960]   So I hope that they, yeah, I'll take a look at it
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:37.800]   if it comes out.
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.680]   - And with you Andy, it's probably gonna be,
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.920]   did they say what the price would be?
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.640]   It'd probably be Apple price, which is--
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.480]   - It's gonna be expensive.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.600]   I've heard it's gonna be expensive.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.840]   - 50, yeah, so I'm with you, I have chargers everywhere.
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.280]   In fact, it reminds me I'm gonna get some more.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.760]   - I mean, it'll be a cool thing to have on your nightstand
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.720]   when you buy one of them and it's hard to think
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:57.560]   what I would use it.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.160]   - Or for travel, but really, it's hard to overstate
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.360]   how flexible people are when it comes to,
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.560]   this is the first thing, this is the first piece
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.600]   of technology I'm gonna interact with over the course of the day.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.080]   And it's the last piece of technology
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.000]   I'm gonna interact with over the course of the day.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.520]   When you get to that sort of thing where no,
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.200]   this isn't necessarily a productivity thing,
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.120]   this isn't necessarily a feature thing,
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.600]   this is part of my lifestyle, this is part of my daily routine,
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.560]   this is why people are willing to spend silly amounts of money
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.240]   on a really good shower head,
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.800]   because it's one of those little things
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.640]   that gives you a small amount of reassurance that,
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.440]   okay, everything is okay, I got my dental floss dispenser,
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.040]   I got my charger, I got everything is okay.
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.960]   So yup, it's not a big deal to me,
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.440]   so long as for that price, it really has to work great.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:45.160]   Like Alex says, the first time that you bump the nightstand
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.760]   and you happen to jostle your watch a little bit off center
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.200]   and it stops charging and you're screwed the next day,
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.280]   that's when people are saying, okay, I've got eight hours left
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.120]   and by two week return plan, I'm returning this thing right now.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.960]   - Yeah, I feel like for a hundred bucks,
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.000]   I could get three of these tilt view wireless chargers
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.320]   and then do what you do, Annie, put one in the office,
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.160]   put one in where I have one at work.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.240]   - I think I actually had that one.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.760]   - Yeah, it's a big thing, this is easy
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.480]   because you know it's on there.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:18.720]   And by the way, doesn't your iPhone go blunk when it's,
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.440]   yeah, and there's a green light at the bottom of the lights up,
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:24.640]   but there's really less, I don't find that I'm,
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.920]   you know, waking up in the morning,
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.280]   oh, 'cause it didn't charge.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.920]   - You winter time. - Sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.280]   Oh, it could just quickly, in winter time,
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.320]   when I had the, again, when I had my wireless charger,
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.160]   that was a problem because I'd have like a really thick comforter
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.600]   and sometimes I'd roll over at night
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.080]   and the edge of that thick comforter would just brush up
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.880]   against the edge of the table just enough to disrupt a cable
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:48.240]   or something and knock it off just a little bit.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.560]   - Yeah, you really don't want that.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.480]   - That happened to my palm pre and my Nexus 4, so always.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.320]   (laughing)
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.680]   It was right up and it was in charge.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.640]   But I think the promise of this technology is that,
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.360]   I mean, one day the big dream is that it'll be
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.280]   in every restaurant and every coffee shop,
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.520]   in every taxi or car sharing service.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.680]   It'll just be everywhere you go, so if your phone is low,
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.480]   like in the car, you'll put it down, in the restaurant,
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.600]   you'll put it down at the table, at the office,
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:12.040]   you have a meeting, you'll put it down and it'll just charge.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:14.400]   - Yeah, your dream. - Because there are some sites
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.680]   that will let, there's some sites that have convenience
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.960]   chargers where, you know, there's that little hydra,
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.160]   sometimes actually when they even take an Uber or Lyft,
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.960]   there'll be like a little snake out there that says,
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.080]   oh, here's a USB-C, here's a micro USB,
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.480]   here's a lightning charger. - You can't trust them.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.720]   - But I mean, there's such a security vulnerability, yeah.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.280]   - Not just a security vulnerability,
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.520]   but I don't know where they ordered this from.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.320]   And if they've got some Chinese charger,
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.040]   that is not like what, not Apple MIFI certified.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.240]   It's, yeah, again, I would never,
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.840]   there's a security problem, there's a safety problem,
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.560]   but when you have wireless charging,
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.600]   so long as you don't have Bluetooth turned on
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.400]   on an Android phone and lots of permissions
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.640]   that you shouldn't have turned on,
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.000]   I would absolutely trust that it's Starbucks.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.480]   - Yeah, I have to, but I never plug anything into it.
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.680]   Like at an airport, I always see people plug into that
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.480]   little USB charger, I'm like, that is crazy talk.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.360]   Like, you know, you are just, you know,
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.080]   I won't even in our own car, we own it,
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.800]   I won't plug it in, you know, it's kind of like,
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.440]   I want to know what is actually interfacing,
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.080]   and I want it to be dumb.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.720]   - I actually had to like pay for,
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.080]   I was using, I was renting a zip car,
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.480]   one of the first or second times I rented a zip car,
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.000]   I was using, I said, oh, great Bluetooth,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.640]   I'll just use the speakers.
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.040]   And unfortunately, this Ford had to think,
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.160]   oh, automatically, don't worry,
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.800]   we can dial your phone through your contacts.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.880]   And I actually wound up returning the car late
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.120]   'cause I was sitting there,
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.320]   trying to figure out how to completely like factory reset,
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.000]   the factory installed radio to make sure
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.120]   it wasn't getting all of my contacts handed over
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.600]   to the next person who uses this damn thing.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.400]   - So the MyFi logo has been updated,
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.040]   these are the made for, not MyFi,
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.920]   MyFi made for iPhone, a new logo,
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.200]   I didn't know the old logo,
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.040]   - MFI.
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.120]   - MFI, is that how we say it, MFI?
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:54.960]   - Yeah.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.760]   - And for the first time ever,
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.880]   I didn't know this wasn't a possibility,
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.600]   you can now buy a Lightning 2 headphone jack,
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.440]   or what is that like?
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.000]   - Mail, stereo headphone mail jack, right?
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.360]   - Oh, so basically you can plug it in your line in.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.920]   - Right, exactly, so you can route the output of your phone,
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.560]   the audio output of your phone is another device,
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.880]   which is beautiful for like capturing voicemails
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.200]   or really good news.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.320]   - For using it, we're in for using it as an audio source
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.440]   in an arbitrary device.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.360]   - Yeah, I have lots of devices that I would like to,
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.400]   that have line in that I would like to put it into.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.840]   - Which is weird because I can't,
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.440]   I remember like somebody, I think he worked for Apple,
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.400]   making a big statement about how nobody uses audio cables
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.520]   anymore and they're pointless
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.800]   and we don't need audio cables anymore.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.600]   - Who was that?
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.520]   I think some crazy person rushed the stage
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.440]   at an Apple event and went over.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.640]   - Okay, I'm still mad that Sonos stopped offering,
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.640]   it's 30 pin with the dock, remember I used to dock away?
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.680]   And then they got rid of that
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.680]   and they never did a lightning cable one,
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.400]   I guess you just do it all supposed to be wireless, right?
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.720]   The modern world.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:11.160]   - And is Apple allowing both male and female,
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.440]   or is it just the mail out for the cables?
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.280]   - Well, the female they sell, that's the--
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.240]   - They sell that, but can other people make
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.840]   them themselves for the right choice?
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.680]   - They've been doing it for a while,
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:23.680]   they think they made the splitters
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.240]   where you could split from lightning to 3.5 and back.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.040]   - In recent times, they've done a lot of,
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:34.080]   they've expanded the MFI program
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.960]   so that, excuse me, I made for Apple program
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.080]   so that you can do a lot more with USB-C
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.480]   than you could before.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.320]   You can do a lot more with the lightning jack
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.960]   that used to be proprietary
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.920]   and it's just typical Apple being conservative
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.520]   about what they're gonna let third parties do
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.720]   until they've really got the hardware locked down
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.880]   and they really know that it's not going to result
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.680]   in something being set on fire,
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.280]   which sounds like I'm making a joke,
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.440]   but every time that you get one of these,
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.320]   like, rabbit news items about how someone wants to sue Apple
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.680]   because something blew up, it turns out to be some cheap,
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:07.760]   no name Chinese charger or something that came in a box,
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.960]   or something they bought at a,
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.960]   one of the biggest dangers in my box of cables are
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.800]   the times where I needed a charging cable,
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.680]   didn't have one, I was desperate so I was at CVS
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.760]   where they have a little bin of no name chargers
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.000]   and unfortunately that sort of enters the scrum,
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.440]   I don't, I have forgotten that this is a crap piece
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.040]   of junk five dollar cable and not an actual $15 one,
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.960]   whether you buy it from Apple from somebody else,
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.920]   you really, you never, never, never want to save money
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:37.800]   on a charger or on a cable, never.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.440]   - This is something that will warm the cockles
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.400]   of Christina Warren's heart, she's a big Bob Burgers fan,
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.040]   Bob's Burgers fan.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.040]   The creator of Bob's Burgers is made to deal with Apple
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:52.200]   for an animated musical called Central Park,
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.280]   who'll be Apple's first animated series,
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.120]   its first musical and they placed in order for not one
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.800]   but two seasons, 26 episodes, Central Park is a story
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.560]   according to a variety of family, of caretakers
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:09.200]   who live and work in Central Park and end up saving the park
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.360]   and basically the world.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:16.000]   Josh Gad and Correter Norris Smith also worked
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.520]   on the series with Lauren Bouchard, who is the,
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:21.040]   - Yeah, this is gonna be good.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:21.880]   - This is gonna be really good,
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:25.000]   not only because Bob's Burgers is intensely funny,
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.360]   but for really no reason that they're required to do so,
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.280]   almost every episode over the end credits,
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:34.880]   they have an original song that they will just simply write
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.360]   for the last for 30 seconds over the credits
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.680]   a new animation for it.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.920]   They've done a few different episodes where,
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:45.920]   look, look for an episode named Topsy
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.080]   where the regime, the son writes an entire musical
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.000]   based on Thomas Edison electrocuting an elephant
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.760]   and you're like, "My God, that is a super catchy,
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:56.760]   wonderful song."
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:00.120]   So the idea of whoever it was who really,
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.400]   who was, who said yes, I hope that they said yes,
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.400]   the fastest way they could possibly do it.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.880]   And I gotta say, this is the first,
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:10.040]   this is how these streaming exclusives work.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:13.840]   It's not that people look back and open the brochures,
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.920]   that's a really engaging portfolio of content.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.760]   It's that, oh, the Bob's Burgers guy is doing a musical series.
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.880]   - Ooh, I might have to subscribe to music that way.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.200]   - Okay, is that weren't enough?
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.400]   Are you ready to hear who the voice talent is in this?
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.400]   - Smo-ah.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.680]   - O-M-G.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:33.560]   - Leslie Odom Jr.
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:37.160]   from of Hamilton fame, David Diggs,
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.840]   who was Thomas Jefferson on Hamilton,
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.680]   Titus Burgess, who plays the fabulous Titus
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:47.720]   on the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, he's wonderful.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.280]   - Kristen Vell, who is fabulous from the good,
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.080]   what is it, the good earth, the good parts,
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:56.960]   the good place, Stanley Tucci?
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.520]   Man, can't wait to see this.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.200]   - Amazing voices.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.040]   - Great people.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.520]   - And you'll recognize every one of them
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.000]   and you may not know the name, but you'll go,
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.040]   oh, oh, who is that?
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:09.680]   - Yeah, I can't wait.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:12.200]   - I think more than anyone else I think Apple is really just,
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:16.200]   they are, after a false start, they are,
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.480]   I think that they really are just looking for 10 polls only.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.000]   - Yeah, this will be made by 20th Century Fox Television,
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.040]   who, and I guess Bushard is under contract with them.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.960]   So the real question that comes up,
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.920]   and we've been, every week we've had a new announcement
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.280]   like this, the real question that comes up is,
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.560]   where can we see this though?
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.680]   What's this gonna be?
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:39.520]   - Well, I think we're gonna find out in five years.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:40.520]   (laughing)
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.920]   I'm not even joking.
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:45.240]   I mean, I really think that all of this
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:48.280]   is really gonna come together when it's,
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.600]   it might be an Apple Watch sort of migration
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.720]   where they know what they have to do next,
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.120]   but they don't know where they're gonna end up,
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.680]   but once they figure it out,
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:57.080]   they're gonna have everything in place
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.600]   to make that thing work.
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:02.920]   I know that unfortunately, podcasts are recorded
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.320]   and saved on servers everywhere.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:08.160]   So I know that I was kind of negative a year ago
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.320]   or two years ago about Apple becoming a content company,
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.520]   but they've been making a lot of really cool moves.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.200]   And if you look at them as saying,
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.880]   "Hey, we've got Apple Music and we've got three crappy shows,
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.080]   "one that you're kind of interested in,
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.280]   "and one that you really want,"
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.320]   that doesn't sound impressive,
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:24.280]   but they're making all of these moves that are intended
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.880]   so that in five years' time, they could be like a Hulu.
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:30.120]   They can't be a Netflix and they wouldn't want to
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.320]   'cause there's already Netflix,
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.800]   but in terms of having a really good stable of shows
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.080]   that have enough high profile people,
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.800]   not like some of the Netflix movies
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.960]   where they just threw some money at a famous name
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.080]   who decided to take a script that they rejected
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:46.040]   four years ago and make it on the cheap,
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.120]   but essentially saying,
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.280]   "I will let you have your,
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.520]   "all the meetings that you've had
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:53.840]   "with network executives in which they have nothing
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.880]   "but giving you trouble and giving you financial trouble
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.560]   "and wanting to have your hooks into your career come to us.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.200]   "We are desperate for someone of your caliber."
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.760]   That's, they're building a really good stable of content
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.720]   and I'm really keen.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.440]   I'm doing more, now that, well, of course,
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:10.360]   it's snowing 12 to 18 inches today,
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:13.360]   but if there's one thing that keeps me on the bike,
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:16.240]   that keeps me having vegetarian meals
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:18.360]   when I really just want to go across the street
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.320]   and get a pizza,
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.680]   it's 'cause I want to live longer to see
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.520]   what this turns into.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.800]   Apple's doing something really interesting here.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:25.960]   Question I have.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.560]   That's not my only reason to live, I want to share.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.560]   I'm just saying that it's,
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:31.040]   it's a reason. It's a good one.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:35.800]   If you are a fan of old Apple memorabilia,
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.480]   you want to know a guy named Hap Plain,
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.520]   he works at a Lexus dealership in Monterey,
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:43.680]   but he's also a collector of Vintel, vintage Apple gear,
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:48.080]   and he's selling quite a bit of his collection on eBay,
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:50.360]   a Mac portable, Apple's original laptop,
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.360]   the 170 Apple's first power book,
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:55.480]   the G3iBook, and a lot of prototypes.
[01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:59.080]   Steve, these are the moments where I wish I was filthy rich.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.880]   - Yeah.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:01.720]   - Some of them are a little pricey.
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:02.880]   - I would have a library.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:07.240]   - $10,000 gets you a clear prototype of the Apple Macintosh.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:10.280]   I want the clear Apple IIC.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.680]   I so want that.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:16.560]   Steve Wozniak's classic cinema display.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.480]   Let me just, let me go look at this actually.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.320]   - Yeah.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:21.680]   - Let's see what these prices are by now.
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:24.640]   They're probably a little bit steeper.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:30.160]   - I used to have, I used to be paying a lot of money
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.400]   per month to store all of the really cool old Macs
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.320]   and stuff that I bought.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.240]   I would buy at the MIT flea market on a regular basis.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:38.560]   It is a sickness, you really,
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.720]   it's almost like having a boat because yes,
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.840]   you can afford the $30 for this Mac SE limited edition,
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:49.360]   but it's kind of cost you $90 a month forever to keep it.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.800]   And, but yeah, $15,000 for a clear Mac portable.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:54.640]   - Who?
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:56.240]   - That's pricey.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.120]   - If $15,000 didn't mean much to me, boy,
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.720]   did I, boy, would I spend that.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.560]   If I had that kind of--
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.200]   - Who, 99,000 for the Lisa?
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.840]   - 99, oh, that's a joke price.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.720]   - No, that's, there's so many,
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.760]   there was somebody on eBay, I bookmarked because I was
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.240]   fascinated by this listening.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.400]   Somebody was trying, had a factory sealed new in,
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:20.320]   new in box, unopened, new old stock,
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:24.120]   Apple Lisa Mouse that they had something like a $13,000
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.480]   or even a $20,000 buy it now for.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:29.080]   And I would be fascinated to see if there was anybody
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.600]   in this world who was eager to pay that amount of money.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.400]   All you need is one.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.760]   All you need is one person.
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:38.080]   - This is kind of a, kind of amazing.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:43.160]   Prototype for the Apple iPad, first generation, four grand.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:47.040]   Three grand for a Mac mini prototype, these prototypes.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.400]   - You wonder where he got these.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:49.760]   - He's been, he's just been hanging around.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.560]   These are all legally acquired according to his motto.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:55.920]   - You get, you get in at the right time
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:57.880]   where you just simply put out ads.
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:01.440]   How do certain people have like original Star Wars
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.520]   Stormtrooper masks and original time fighters?
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.680]   Because there was a time where somebody had,
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.000]   someone who worked on that show in 1984 had that
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.920]   in their garage and was shocked that someone would,
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:13.240]   wanted to spend a thousand, could we give them a thousand bucks
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.080]   for it?
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.880]   And this is exactly the time, I mean, speaking of the MIT
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:20.640]   flea market, you see how these things move in cycles.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:23.520]   When I started going to the MIT flea market as a kid,
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.080]   like vintage radios, like the really cool ones,
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.800]   like the art deco style, like the church cathedral style,
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:33.440]   we're going for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:36.040]   And then there was like, it's over a three year period.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:40.040]   They, the really beautiful art deco radio that might have been
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:43.000]   used as set dressing in the thin man that was easily,
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.880]   would easily sell for $500 was now going for 130.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.520]   And then the last time I saw radios of Eddie Kind,
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.280]   I was seeing a table full of just a sign saying,
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.120]   I will sell for $5 if I think that you will love it
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.320]   and treat it with respect.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:00.600]   Because people who grew up with radio were dying off.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:05.600]   It's us losers who are now in our 30s and 40s and 50s
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.080]   who are showing nostalgia for the Apple PowerBook 100
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.800]   that we had as a kid, or the Macintosh portable
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.160]   that we couldn't afford as a kid.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.800]   But hey, now we've got our kids are out of the house.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.080]   We've already explained to the kids that college
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.640]   is so expensive, we can't even afford to send you.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.920]   But now we've got $40,000 that we save that we're not
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.160]   going to be spending in your college education.
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.320]   Hey, let's have the clear translucent Apple 2C.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.000]   So this is, this is why all this stuff is now being pulled
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000]   out of the woodwork because there's an enormous amount
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.120]   of money available for it.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.880]   Now, no one will buy it 20 years from now because again,
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.120]   we'll be start to die off.
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:42.520]   But it's a wonderful thing to see as someone who doesn't
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.040]   throw things out, as someone who just finished cleaning out
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:48.520]   a house after 10 years and say, oh, I would have thrown
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:50.880]   that out five years ago, but now it's collectible.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.800]   I'm keeping that.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:57.000]   - Here's the best deal of all $400 for Steve Wozniak's
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.600]   cinema display complete with the FedEx label
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:03.240]   and Steve's address on the back.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.000]   - For an Xbox, it's a deal.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.960]   - Let's take on Scully autograph PowerBook 100.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:08.800]   - No, thanks.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.240]   (both laughing)
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.040]   - No, no, I don't want that one.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:12.960]   Let's take a break.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.480]   We're going to get your picks of the week, gentlemen.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:18.360]   That was from April 5th, 2001, that's in the display.
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:21.680]   So it's not exactly a late model technology.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.120]   We'll get your picks ready in just a second.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.200]   But first a word from Rocket Mortgage.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.760]   Folks, if you are ready to buy a new house,
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.640]   a refinance, your existing house,
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:32.040]   you've got to know about Rocket Mortgage from what is
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.920]   officially now the number one lender in the United States
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.760]   in every measurement, every metric.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.240]   Of course, number one, according to JT Power
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.200]   and customer satisfaction for eight years in a row,
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.280]   but now even number one in terms of volume,
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:48.280]   they are big, they are the guys, quick and loans.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:50.200]   And what I love about them, I'm glad,
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.320]   I'm so happy for their success.
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:55.840]   Dan Harmon and his crew just really love technology.
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.840]   They've done so much to revitalize downtown Detroit.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:02.080]   And they want you and me and all us geeks
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.400]   to have something alone approval process
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.000]   that fits the 21st century.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.320]   They realized, you know, Dan said,
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:11.160]   this is like going back in time when you get alone.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.520]   You go to the bank, you have to put on a tie or,
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:16.480]   you know, nice dress and you have to fill out
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:18.800]   an application, 20 page application.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.400]   And you're still not done 'cause then you go home
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.520]   and you got to go to the attic and find pay stubs
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.440]   and bank statements from years gone by.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.800]   And it's just crazy.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:29.480]   And on all of that, you still don't find out for weeks,
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:32.080]   sometimes months, if you've been approved for a loan.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.400]   Now fast forward, the 21st century here,
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.120]   rocket mortgage from quick and loans.
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:41.120]   It's an entirely online experience.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.480]   About eight minutes from beginning to end,
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.080]   actually you can shorten that right now.
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.240]   If you go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:49.880]   and get the account set up and get started,
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.480]   they'll just take you a few minutes.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.920]   Then when you see a house you want
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:55.160]   or you decide I want a refi before rates go up,
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.380]   you can do this.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:38:00.040]   Oh, just like boom.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.520]   Just like go, just answer a few questions.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.200]   You already know the answer to no going to the attic,
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.760]   nothing just because they have relationships
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:07.880]   with all the financial institutions.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.960]   You just give them permission
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.840]   and they will get all the information they need
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.720]   and crunch the numbers and minutes later give you an answer.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.960]   No wonder they're the number one online mortgage lender
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.120]   and this is not just in volume, not just J.D. Power,
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:24.160]   inside mortgage finance said so too.

[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.760]   they'll offer you the loans you qualify for.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:35.360]   You choose the term, the rate, the down payment,

[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.080]   Rocketmortgage.com/macbreak, equal housing lender,

[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.880]   number 3030.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.560]   We thank Rocketmortgage by Quick and Loans
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:14.320]   for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.960]   Mr. Inaco, you're pick of the week.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.760]   Mine's, I really like the interface of this one.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:22.040]   This is a utility for the Mac called Unclutter.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:24.960]   It is technically a clipboard and file manager
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.360]   but what it is is for stuff that you want to have handy,
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:32.280]   like you have a file or a text flipping or something,
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:35.280]   what it does is it uses the top of the screen
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.960]   as a drag area.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.680]   So if you have a file that you wanna keep tabs on,
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.600]   meaning you're gonna have to paste them
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.560]   to a hundred different emails or use all the time,
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.400]   you can just drag it to the top of the menu bar,
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.880]   the Unclutter sort of window shade comes down
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.920]   and there's a drag area where we can drop it.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:53.880]   If you have images, text flipping, things like that,
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:55.960]   like there's a lot of boilerplate that you happen to use,
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.720]   you can drag it into a clippings area.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:00.040]   And the part that I find most useful
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:03.440]   is just a place you can take quick notes.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:07.120]   So many times, I've got BB Edit documents,
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.040]   I'm down to like BB Edit Untitled document number 412
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:12.440]   because when I call somebody to make an appointment
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.360]   or I'm calling to like get a price quote again on movers
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.600]   or some house worth and he's get done,
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.600]   I remember, oh, that's right,
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.400]   he might give me numbers or phone numbers.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:23.480]   That's the place where I just have a quick scratch pad.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:27.320]   I think it's a really interesting twist
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:29.760]   on the basic user interface.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.960]   I would like to see other apps think about this.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:35.960]   When you talk about services that need to go across apps
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.760]   and across the entire Mac experience,
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:40.080]   I think it's really, really super interesting.
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:41.840]   It's 10 bucks, but there's a free trial.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.600]   If you go to unclutterapp.com
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.800]   instead of downloading it from the App Store,
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.720]   I have not bought it yet.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.720]   I've only installed it about a week and a half ago,
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:52.920]   but I've used it enough that I might have to just
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.360]   pay the 10 bucks out of simple decency
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:58.000]   'cause the five-founders are useful.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   - Very cool.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.320]   Renee Ritchie, pick of the week.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:05.720]   - So I have a tip this time more than a pick
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.600]   and it follows on,
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.200]   join us during the New Excellent Report
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:11.080]   for the Wall Street Journal where there's these,
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.280]   all these people, I have family and friends
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.840]   and even workmates who are convinced that Facebook
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.640]   was spying on them and using the microphone
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:20.080]   or Instagram is using the microphone to listen to them
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.160]   because you would say something and then all of a sudden
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.720]   you'd get asked for it, but as Joanna
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.160]   and some other people have gone through
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.280]   and it's found that they're really good
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:32.480]   at sort of coagulating or annexing all of these
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.760]   other data sources.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.400]   So you have the data that you get through Facebook
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.280]   and the Facebook pixel and you have data
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.760]   that they get through supermarket chains,
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.840]   all these huge data aggregation companies
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.200]   and they put it all together and they can get
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:45.280]   an incredibly accurate picture of who you are
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.400]   and what you want.
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.500]   And because they don't, not always clear
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:50.920]   about where that stuff comes from, it can feel creepy.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.800]   It can feel like they're literally following you
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:53.840]   around the internet.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.760]   So one of the writers on IMOR, Joe Keller,
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.400]   put together a really awesome article on,
[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:00.720]   if you are bothered by this, I mean,
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.760]   some people like the idea of having really highly
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.000]   tailored advertising.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.520]   Other people do find it super creepy.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.080]   So if you're one of those people,
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.560]   he goes through how you can opt out,
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.200]   not just of the Facebook tracking,
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.480]   but of the tracking from the major aggregators
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:16.800]   like Axia and Epsilon, Experian Oracle, Quantum
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:19.200]   and KBM Group and how you can do settings
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.920]   in the iPhone to limit tracking
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:23.480]   and how you can use plugins on other devices to do it.
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.600]   And I know this is happening,
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.680]   it's one of those things where you can be aware of it
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.920]   and sometimes you see an ad and just be shocking.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.480]   How did that get there?
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.560]   And if you've experienced that sort of feeling,
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.360]   even if you don't end up implementing this stuff,
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.200]   just going through the process gives you a feeling
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.200]   like you have a little bit of control back
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.440]   over your destiny and you have a little bit
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:45.680]   of a tin foil on your hat and you can choose,
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:47.160]   exercise it when you want to.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.160]   And that sort of takes away the stress of it happening.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.520]   At least I found that for me and a lot of the people
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:52.920]   that I shared it with.
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.480]   - Very nice.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:57.360]   It's always good to know how to protect yourself.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.200]   Great information.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:42:59.200]   - And again, some people won't care,
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:01.720]   but if you do care then you should know how to do it.
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:03.680]   - That's kind of my feeling, I don't care,
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:05.280]   but I understand if somebody does care
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.640]   and you certainly should have the tools
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.800]   and the ability to control it yourself.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:11.280]   - Well, I was going to, I was going to Ottawa
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.000]   to visit my sister and I opened Instagram
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.320]   and it said use OpenTable to reserve your Ottawa restaurant.
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.160]   - Oh, that's crazy.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:18.480]   - And I never said I was going to Ottawa,
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:19.880]   but I just said it in one phone call to her
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:21.880]   and one text message, it's just when it called well.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:23.160]   And I had no idea how I did it
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:26.760]   and it turned out that I think three out of the last five years
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:29.040]   I'd gone to Ottawa and posted in Facebook from Ottawa
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:31.040]   so it assumed that I'd be doing that again.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.680]   But it took me like 30 minutes to figure that out
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:34.680]   and in that time I'm like,
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.440]   no, no, it really is listening to me.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.960]   (laughing)
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.400]   - Knowledge is power.
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.240]   - Wow.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.080]   - Yep.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:44.440]   Alex Lindsey, what do you got for us today?
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.080]   - I got two quick things.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:48.160]   One is we were just talking about chargers.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:51.080]   I got a new charger and I'm constantly upgrading chargers.
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.600]   I spend a lot of time on the road
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:55.680]   and I pretty much stick now into the family of the anchor.
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.240]   So, anchor now has a 10.
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.080]   - Look at that.
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:58.920]   - That's 10.
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:43:59.760]   - Holy cow.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.080]   - You can put it in a--
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:03.320]   - What's the total wattage I think in the--
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:06.120]   - So, don't a wattage of 60 watts or 12 amps?
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:08.320]   That means that up to five of these
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:13.320]   is going to get the 2.4 amps per channel.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.600]   But what it does mean is that it's,
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.480]   so it'll start going down if you start adding more than that.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:19.640]   But one of the things for me is being able to,
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.720]   I come in a lot of times from traveling
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.760]   and I'll go into a hotel room or wherever.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:25.400]   I'll set down, I just wanna plug everything in
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.480]   and I wanna walk away and know that it's all
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.360]   like I don't wanna have to trade around and figure it out.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.440]   I know that if I plug in more than five,
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.520]   I'm not gonna get the fastest charge,
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.400]   but it's mostly I just don't wanna have to think about it
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:38.560]   anymore, I just wanna walk away and have it done.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.120]   So, it's got a little switch.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:41.120]   There's a couple of important things
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.240]   when I look for chargers.
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.080]   The switch doesn't matter.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.840]   In fact, I think that that's the only thing
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:45.840]   I don't like about it.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.680]   'Cause once I plug it in,
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:50.480]   it does have to have a figure eight on the back
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.600]   because I lose my figure eight
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:54.280]   and I usually can steal them from TVs.
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.760]   So, if I, if I steal it from the TV, well, that's good.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:01.080]   - I do, I don't think that my TV never works.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.200]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:07.760]   I never actually, I never used TVs in hotel rooms,
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:10.960]   but I do use their figure eight to either plug in my computer.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:13.240]   Like if I don't have an adapter in Japan
[01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.520]   or something like that or not Japan,
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:17.920]   but in other places, I will just pull out of the back of TV
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:19.200]   and put it into my Apple charger.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.880]   So, anyway, so the figure eight is important
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.680]   and then a light on the front.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:23.880]   So, there's a little light on the front.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.200]   I don't believe in buying chargers
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:27.160]   that don't have these little lights
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.560]   because you end up with this whole like you plug it in
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.760]   and you can't plug something else in
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.600]   and you can't figure out why it's not charging.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:33.760]   You need to know, did the charge,
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.960]   is it getting to this?
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:36.720]   And then is it getting to the next thing?
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:39.040]   So, I won't buy a charger without a light.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:41.000]   And so, anyway, so that's the anchor.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.680]   The other one, the other one I have to admit
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:43.880]   is Lisa's fault.
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.840]   My other recommendation, Leo, is the pop in a cob.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:49.680]   The pop, the--
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:51.560]   - Oh, I love the pop cobs.
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.600]   Oh my God, did she give you some?
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.640]   - She did. (laughs)
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:58.560]   She gave me some when I was on screen savers on Saturday
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.960]   and it is so--
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.040]   - Isn't the best.
[01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:01.880]   - I loved it.
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:05.240]   - I thought it was kind of a gimmicky,
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.080]   so it's popcorn on the cob.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.520]   And I thought, oh yeah, this is the kind of thing
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.680]   that you get that a ye old country store
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.600]   and it's just terrible.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.440]   - Right.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.280]   It isn't.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.520]   It's the best popcorn you've ever had.
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.880]   I don't understand how--
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:21.560]   - And the thing is, you put it in a paper bag.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.000]   It comes with the paper bag included, by the way.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.320]   - It comes with the paper bag.
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:27.280]   - You throw it in the microwave.
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:30.360]   And so, it's microwave popcorn that isn't radioactive.
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.200]   - No.
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.080]   - It tastes like real-- - It tastes better
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.320]   than popcorn you pop on the stove.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.080]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:37.320]   'Cause I have one of those little things
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.640]   with a little turn,
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.240]   a little crank that you have. - So you wrap it up
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.160]   in the paper bag. - Now she butters it
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:43.920]   before she puts it in the paper bag.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:46.320]   - So I don't know if that's a good idea.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:47.160]   - Yeah.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:48.000]   - I did it the first time.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.320]   And then I had a bag that was all covered in butter.
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.160]   - Right.
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:52.000]   - I probably put a twist butter on it.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.240]   So I was just like, I just pop it
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:54.080]   and then I add the butter later.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:54.920]   - I'll put the butter in that later.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.760]   - Exactly.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.840]   - You know, and I guess they say that
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.680]   a lot of farmers markets are now putting these in
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:00.800]   so you can cost a lot less.
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.840]   You can get them for like five bucks for six or whatever.
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.120]   - We bought LisaBot 100.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.280]   (laughing)
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.760]   - Is this like bone in rib eye leo?
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.280]   Does it increase the taste?
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:12.600]   - It is actually the best tasting pop you ever had.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:15.040]   I think the brown bag is part of it.
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.800]   It doesn't have any of that weird industrial oils.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:21.320]   She thinks it's best because it leaves the husk on the cob
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:23.200]   'cause so it just pops off the cob
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:24.520]   and the few kernels that don't use
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.280]   just kind of brush them off the cob.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.560]   You throw the cob out and then you have this popcorn
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.040]   and it's really good popcorn.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:31.880]   Well it's also good.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:34.240]   Does it make a mass quantity?
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:36.520]   So it's just right for one setting, you know,
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:38.320]   and sitting, otherwise that will overeat pop.
[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.720]   - It is, it is so good.
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.040]   - It's too good.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.360]   - Oh very always.
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.480]   - That's fun to make as it is to eat.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.440]   - Oh yes.
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:48.280]   - You see pop?
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:49.320]   - It's really quick.
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.280]   What is the brand name on that?
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:54.960]   - I think it's called Pop-in-Cobs.
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:55.840]   And there's a lot of people that make them,
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.000]   but the one that is here.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:57.840]   - This is the one I would get.
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:02.280]   - Yeah, 'cause this is P-O-P-P-I-N-Cobs.com.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:03.320]   I don't know where she found it.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.680]   She might have seen it on Instagram.
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:06.560]   I think it probably is an Instagram ad.
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:09.600]   But she bought so much of it.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.200]   That's why she's giving it away.
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:14.240]   It's the best popcorn I've ever had.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.480]   - I admit if I bought a lot of it,
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:16.720]   I would not give it away.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:19.160]   This is, it does look like it gets much more affordable
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:20.520]   'cause I think we buy a handful of them.
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:21.680]   - Yeah, yeah, expensive if you only buy two.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.040]   - This is the only place I've seen
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.320]   where you can buy like 10 or 15,
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.480]   'cause they're like $4 each if you buy them on Amazon.
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:28.480]   - How many did you buy?
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.280]   - I'm in a cheap box.
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.760]   - She bought them on uncommon goods.
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:32.760]   That's a catalog.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.000]   You didn't, oh, you only bought 50 of them,
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.280]   not 100 of them.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:39.560]   Okay.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:40.800]   We only bought 50.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:42.720]   Let's get that right.
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:45.800]   But look, they have a wholesale division at Pop 'n' Cobs.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.040]   So maybe you ought to go there
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:50.000]   and just arrange to have a supply.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.440]   She's been getting out samples.
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:52.760]   - But the price is good.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.280]   - The 10-pack is much better.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.880]   For $15.99, I mean, that's now starting
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:58.440]   to get competitive with your regular microwave popcorn.
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:02.520]   And it's way more healthy than your regular microwave popcorn.
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.840]   - And a lot of my kids thought about it.
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:09.440]   - It tastes like you popped it in the popper.
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.280]   It's phenomenal.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:12.120]   And if you don't want butter, well then you got dry pop.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:15.120]   But we put a lot of butter in salt on it.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:15.960]   - 'Cause we're bad.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:16.800]   - And it tastes better than hot air.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.000]   I mean, it's like it's not like empty.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:20.880]   Yeah, there's something about it that's really good.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.520]   The only popcorn I like better than this is,
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.600]   in Zimbabwe they make this,
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:29.080]   they roast like regular maize
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:30.120]   and turn it into popcorn.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:32.280]   And it's like the most gnarly popcorn ever.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:33.520]   And that's probably the only one
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:35.200]   that I've had that's better than this.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:36.040]   - So it's cool.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.880]   - Can I just, as long as we're talking about popcorn,
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:40.120]   I still think my former Mac pick of the week,
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:44.560]   the stir crazy popcorn popper is still tops.
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.400]   It brings the best popcorn that I've ever tasted.
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:47.240]   - Oh, I had that thing so much, Andy.
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.520]   I bought two of them.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:51.520]   A beer recommendation and I've thrown them out.
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.120]   One broke.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.480]   It gets hot butter everywhere.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.680]   It's the worst, single worst way to make popcorn, Andy.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:03.880]   Okay, first of all, I don't melt popcorn.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.400]   I don't, you melt butter in there.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:07.560]   - Well, you're supposed to put some in the lid, right?
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:10.040]   - Well, if you want butter, right, exactly.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.760]   That's clearly not gonna work.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:12.760]   But I have never, I--
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:14.400]   - That's supposed to work that way.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.920]   - Well, if you want butter that way,
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:20.080]   if you have to like carve butter off of everything,
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.800]   I prefer to, this is my, the popcorn in my house
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.520]   takes the place of buying,
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.600]   even when super, super, super bowl week
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.360]   and you buy 10 bags of Doritos for $3.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.200]   - Yeah.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:34.720]   - Okay, it's not the popping popcorn in oil.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:36.640]   It's not necessarily the healthiest thing ever,
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:37.480]   but I don't salt it.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:38.520]   I just, you know, it's great.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.120]   But I've had the same, that same popper
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:40.960]   for a couple of years.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:41.880]   It still works great.
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:45.520]   If the only thing I wish it were immersible for cleaning--
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.080]   - That's, you can't clean it.
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:47.920]   - Yes, you can.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:51.080]   - It's the worst thing I've ever seen.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.760]   - I'll give your $23 back.
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:54.680]   - It's got this cheap little pla,
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:56.520]   this little metal, it's like a coat hanger
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.520]   that spins around slowly, does nothing.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.840]   - All you, oh no.
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:01.080]   - Oh, this is the one I like.
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:02.720]   This is the Whirly Pop.
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:04.360]   That's a real pop.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.120]   - Put on your AR glasses because I need to virtually
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:08.320]   reach out with a leather glove,
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.440]   smack on the face and go air and burr
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.840]   on your Hamilton butt.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:12.680]   - Oh man.
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:14.680]   - I will not sit here and let these stir crazy
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:17.200]   popcorn popper that has given me so much pleasure
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:18.560]   during movies of the past two years,
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:20.200]   beep of smirk, sir.
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:21.360]   I will see you at dawn.
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:23.280]   - I'm sending you some cobs.
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:26.520]   And by the way, after you're done with the cobs,
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:28.400]   they have other uses.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:29.440]   - You can throw them at children.
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.440]   - Yes.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:31.960]   - Get me more popcorn.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:35.000]   Yeah, no, I, because you really sold me on the stir crazy.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000]   I got one.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.440]   - You don't have, I'm sorry, you didn't like,
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:41.120]   I'm glad that it was stirring up something
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:41.960]   I recommend. - You were struggling
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:43.920]   if you bought it, it was the $22 one
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.720]   and not like the $8,000 one over the roof.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:46.800]   - Yeah, it was inexpensive.
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.080]   That was the good news.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:51.360]   But yeah, I don't know, I just,
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.400]   I'm just, now maybe I'm doing something wrong.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.840]   I just think this is not a great design
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:58.240]   for a popcorn popper.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.400]   - And until we really want another appliance
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:03.160]   on our counter, just to pop popcorn.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:05.120]   - If it makes a big bowl of popcorn
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:06.880]   that's as French and fresh as the,
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.760]   I see, maybe there's some nostalgia
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.720]   because my memories of popcorn are,
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:14.000]   mom is taking me and the kids to see the movie.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000]   So of course, we're making like big,
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.560]   big like gross brothers, grocery bags full of like,
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:20.760]   stove pop popcorn.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.080]   And we were simply walking in,
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:24.960]   not even pretending to hide them because we have the guys,
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:26.120]   damn it, we're entitled to no thing.
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:28.920]   - My mistake is using the built in Butterwell.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.760]   - See, I would, I would guess that.
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:34.440]   - I do not use the built in Butterwell.
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.320]   - I have never used the built in butter,
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.680]   even when I had a hot air popper,
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:39.200]   I would never use the built in Butterwell
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:41.200]   because I will not, as great.
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:42.520]   And this is, this is saying something,
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:45.280]   as much as I like butter, butter is wonderful,
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:46.360]   butter is great.
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:49.240]   I don't like butter so much that it's worth afterwards
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:52.200]   having to clean out the dump scoop.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200]   - God, what a mess.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:56.440]   - And the idea is you turn, you pop it
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.920]   and then you turn it upside down.
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.400]   And then the popcorn's in the bowl,
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.240]   but if you use the Butterwell,
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:04.480]   the butter's in your lap as well, which is not.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.800]   - That's a big, that's a big, yeah.
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:07.320]   - It's hard to sift the whole butter,
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:09.080]   the whole, it's hard, I always did the butter
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:10.280]   just in a glass or something.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:11.920]   - And the thing is, once the popcorn's popped,
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:14.480]   the stir just, it effectually spins around.
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:15.680]   It's not moving anything.
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:16.520]   So it's not like, - Well, it's,
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.480]   well, it's mixing in the butter or anything.
[01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:19.880]   - What you're getting at is that,
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:22.760]   that means it's, you've just praised the metal stir.
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:24.480]   'Cause it is done, it's done.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:27.720]   There are no uncooked kernels at the bottom
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:29.360]   because the stir was there.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:32.560]   You are insulting a piece of metal
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:35.880]   that's nothing but work hard for your best interest.
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:37.560]   - Well, mine stopped working entirely.
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:40.480]   - No, but most importantly,
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.960]   what do you put on it other than the butter?
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:42.880]   Like once you add it.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.320]   - Butter and salt, you add the need, right?
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.600]   - For a coffee.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:47.960]   - I'm trying to get the cobs.
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:49.120]   You don't need any implements.
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:50.920]   If you have a microwave, it works very nicely.
[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:52.320]   - Oh, well, actually, oh, that's a problem
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:54.040]   'cause I don't, the one thing that,
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.880]   the one appliances did not, - You don't have a microwave.
[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:58.040]   - I didn't take the bread machine because,
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.480]   ever since I got it 10 years ago
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.400]   and now I've figured out how to make it myself,
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:04.320]   I didn't take the microwave because of the sous vide.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:05.960]   I just don't use it for,
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:08.160]   I used to use the, the microwave used to be for,
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:10.840]   damn it, I can take a half hour for a break for dinner
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:11.760]   and then I have to go back to work.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:14.000]   I don't want to mess with food.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.120]   I was only, for the past year and a half,
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:20.520]   I was only using it when I had forgotten to like,
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.880]   clean out a bowl of beans and the beans
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:25.240]   had like dried all hard and caramelized.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:27.480]   I need to boil water in the bowl to loosen them
[01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:28.320]   and clean them.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:29.880]   And so now I've decided perhaps I will clean
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:32.200]   the bean bowls like promptly
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:33.680]   and therefore I can keep this appliance.
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:36.000]   I, for the first time in, since college,
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.480]   I do not have a microwave oven.
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:42.760]   - Wow, you are very, Amish.
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:43.600]   - Thank you.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:46.920]   - Hey, I put it to you that if it was not
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:49.360]   in Julia Child's kitchen in the 90s, 70s.
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:50.680]   - 100%.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:53.280]   You have several spring form molds, no doubt,
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.920]   for your aspect.
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:57.680]   Andy and Naco, you'll find them at the Chicago Sun Times
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:59.840]   and at CWOB.com.
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:02.200]   That's where he hangs his many hats.
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:04.840]   And of course each week here and on the material podcast
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.680]   where he talks about Android
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:08.880]   in the same animated fashion, it's amazing.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:10.280]   I don't know how he does it.
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:11.120]   That was on.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:12.640]   - I have too much, I have too much love
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:16.240]   to be contained within simply one operating system.
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:17.440]   That's at relay.fm.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.400]   - Thank you, Andy, thank you to Renee Richie.
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.160]   His work is at imore.com
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:23.880]   and of course that vector podcast is a must listen.
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:27.280]   Or watch now, you got video now, which is awesome.
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:31.680]   Iamor E.com/vector, thank you Renee.
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:32.520]   - Thank you so much, Leo.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:34.920]   - Have a wonderful day and Alex Lindsey,
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:37.760]   back to work in the nation's capital.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.640]   - God only knows what he's getting himself up to,
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:41.800]   but I hear there's an opening in the secretary of state.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:42.720]   I don't, maybe.
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:44.240]   - Oh, yeah, exactly.
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:45.600]   Yeah, that's what he's been doing out there.
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.560]   - Pixelcore.com is where to follow them.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.080]   And by the way, they're on Patreon now.
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:51.760]   Go to patreon.com/pixelcore
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:54.600]   and you can be a common Pixelcore member once again.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.520]   They've opened it up for membership and that's fantastic.
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:57.920]   - Yeah, and we're gonna be doing,
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:59.520]   we're gonna be doing actually a stream from DC
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.640]   so people can see a little bit about that on Thursday.
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.200]   And then Fred, who was on screen savers,
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:08.360]   is going to do a Q&A with our Patreon members on Friday.
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:11.640]   So it's an action packed week.
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.680]   - That'd be nice.
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:14.280]   - Oh, and finally, by the way,
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:16.880]   the virtual version of our sale is going on.
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:18.040]   So people still go up and sign up
[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:19.320]   and say they wanna be on the mailing list.
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:22.680]   I think like 800 people wanna buy stuff from us.
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:24.920]   - Oh, you're gonna blow that to the bare walls.
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:28.320]   I got that, I'm so happy about that EX3.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.320]   And you were so nice.
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:32.400]   You included the case, the battery charger, extra memory.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:35.880]   I mean, that is, I have now, I have an ENG package.
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:37.160]   That's awesome.
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.200]   Did you get a check for that?
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:39.480]   Have we paid you for that?
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.680]   - I don't know if that's Shannon.
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:42.920]   Unless you, I have--
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:46.120]   - Well, Shannon, if I have it, I'll come down with the cash.
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.200]   - Okay, sounds good.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.200]   - I don't think I'm wrapping a rubber band.
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:50.880]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:52.040]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.960]   We do Mac Break Weekly Tuesdays,
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:56.000]   round about 11 a.m., it's right after iOS today.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.800]   So it varies, maybe 1 p.m. Pacific.
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:01.000]   Now we're in daylight saving time.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.880]   So that's 1,800 UTC.
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:04.280]   Note the new time.
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:05.640]   You can tune in and watch it.
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:08.400]   Well, I was gonna say YouTube.com/Twit, that's true.
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.560]   But actually, YouTube and all of the various ways
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:13.640]   you can watch live are featured on our own website,
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:15.480]   twit.tv/live.
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:16.600]   So that's probably the place to go.
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:18.800]   Pick the stream that you like the most.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.880]   You can also participate in the chatroom
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:22.600]   at irc.twit.tv.
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.400]   Lovely bunch of people there.
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:26.240]   Chatting away.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:28.160]   It's always nice to see Emily, the Strange,
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.760]   and Vet Man and Synapse.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:32.760]   Amun Rah and Virgil and Scooter X
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:36.720]   and Goodly and Toad Sloth.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:38.800]   They all have such strange names.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:42.960]   It describes them aptly in almost every case, I think.
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:45.520]   If you're not watching live, always
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:46.320]   can watch on demand.
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:49.760]   Get your audio and video at the website twit.tv/MBW
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:54.000]   or subscribe wherever podcasts are distributed.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.560]   If you want to join us in studio, Nathan did.
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:58.600]   Nice to see you.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:57:59.800]   He sat through the whole show.
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:00.880]   I'm proud to say.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:04.320]   All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.200]   Now, my friend, I'm sad to say time
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:10.440]   to get back to work, 'cause right time is over.
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:11.640]   Bye-bye, everybody.
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:14.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:22.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:24.860]   (upbeat music)
