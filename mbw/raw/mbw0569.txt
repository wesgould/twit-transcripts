[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.460]   And there's gonna be some big news today,
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.020]   but after the show.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.980]   So I thought, well, let's bring a panel together
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.620]   who could tell us what could predict
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.020]   what's gonna happen with Apple.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.180]   Starting with the beard.
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.500]   Jim Dalrymple is here from the loop, loopinsight.com.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.660]   Hi, Jim.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.500]   How you doing, Leo?
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.660]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.500]   You too.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.660]   Your beard has been trimmed.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.500]   You know, it's summertime, it sheds a little.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.820]   But are you cutting the sides now a little more?
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.980]   You're doing a little, you've got a new style.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.540]   I was sitting this morning doing this,
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.380]   so then, you know, that happens.
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.580]   I like it.
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.420]   I like it.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.420]   Andy, you're not co, to your right.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.020]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.860]   Hello.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.940]   You don't understand the rural economy.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.940]   It sounds when you have to take the wool to market.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.300]   And then there's the time you trade it
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.900]   for more hay and silage.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.740]   I feel like your sideburns mixed with Jim's beard
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.380]   would make it complete set.
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.820]   It's like a whole person right there.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.780]   We're now attempting this through the video switcher.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.780]   It's a very Karl Marxian sort of thing.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.980]   Like each beard according to his needs,
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.620]   each beard according to his capabilities.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.380]   That's how we create our new, our new, it's a complete set.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.220]   And then meanwhile, Adam Anks from tidbits.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.220]   No, don't mix any.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.220]   Nothing.
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.060]   Nothing.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.780]   He's the whitest guy in Mac technology.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.740]   (laughing)
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.900]   Yeah, well, I've been getting ads since high school.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.740]   That's good.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.060]   Was your hair white in high school?
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.580]   No, no.
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.220]   I also don't tan.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.060]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.260]   I got the worst tan on the track and cross country teams
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.500]   three years running in high school.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.340]   Yeah, I don't understand because you're outside
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.140]   all the time running.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.980]   How do you?
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.740]   And it doesn't make any difference.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.780]   I mean, now do tan a little bit.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.620]   I mean, you can see.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.180]   You wear a floppy room.
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.660]   Oh, look at my watch hands.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.500]   Yeah, there's a little bit.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.340]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.180]   It's a little bit.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.980]   But as it gets, that's, you know,
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.780]   most weekdays in noon.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.820]   So.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.580]   I don't know why I'm focused on personal appearance here.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.660]   It doesn't matter.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.500]   It's not that important.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.820]   Well, maybe because you're the one who's in a nice jacket
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.660]   and a tie and a business dress shirt
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.660]   and you know you could lord it all over us
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.860]   for freelancers that are just in our offices
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.020]   not seeing anybody all day.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.780]   Well, I'm going to a big event this evening.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.140]   It's the release of Rob Reed's new book.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.420]   I mean, he's having a reading in the hate today.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.300]   And so I thought I'd wear a tie in honor of that.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.940]   Rob Reed, founder, creator of listen.com,
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.940]   which became Rhapsody.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.780]   He's married to Morgan Webb of X-Play fame.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.740]   But he also wrote a very good book a couple of years ago
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.660]   called Year Zero about the aliens and Napster
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.660]   and turns out the aliens.
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.420]   Wait, the aliens and Napster or?
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.260]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.940]   Rob is great because he knows technology.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.500]   So his books are really, really fun.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.180]   So Year Zero, the premise was the aliens have been listening
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.700]   to stealing our music for a year
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.140]   because they didn't have good music themselves
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.140]   and now they owe the music in history.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.060]   Oh, yeah, I've read that.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.900]   That's hilarious.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.100]   It's hysterical.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.940]   I forgot that.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.780]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.540]   It reminds me of that old,
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.500]   remember the Voyager record that went out
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.780]   in attached to Voyager?
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.140]   Yeah, it started thinking.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.380]   So there was a joke that we finally got a response
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.540]   from the aliens that consisted of only five words
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.180]   repeated endlessly, send more Chuck Berry records.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.460]   (laughing)
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.980]   We love that Berry guy.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.860]   So his new book is even more timely.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.700]   It's really good.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.980]   It comes out today.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.820]   It's on Audible.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.660]   It's on Amazon.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.740]   Actually, I have a little bit of it
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.220]   on a little bit of the Audible book, just a tiny bit.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.060]   It's called After On.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.380]   And I haven't finished it yet,
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.780]   but John, who has, there's lots of twists and turns.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.180]   It's about Flutter, which is an app.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.860]   Oh, this sounds so science fiction-y.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.260]   There's an app that knows who you are,
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.260]   who all your friends are,
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.500]   who all your connections are, knows where you are.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.620]   So for instance, if you and two of your office mates
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.140]   turn up at a bar at roughly the same time,
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.820]   Flutter knows you're having a meeting
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.620]   and will send you coupons for a particular drink
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.840]   that you might like.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.340]   Oh, that could never happen here.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.260]   It's a, and the funny thing is everybody hates Flutter,
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.900]   but they can't stop using it.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.500]   It's addictive as hell.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.020]   There's also artificial intelligence,
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.180]   the Uber of sex, it's really good.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.940]   And so I just-
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.260]   We've had that for centuries, literally,
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.660]   it's just we have an app with cell phones.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.660]   Yeah, we're just creating new markets using technology.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:36.780]   Anyway, I have to say, I haven't finished it
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.780]   so far I'm loving it.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.820]   John, who has, couldn't stop talking about it.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.980]   And I had to say no spoilers.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.540]   So there's some real surprises apparently coming.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.660]   Congratulations to Rob, he's a good friend of the network.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.300]   And that's why I'm wearing a tie today
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.700]   'cause we're gonna go to his book reading tonight
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.180]   for his debut second.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.980]   He says, I think I beat the sophomore slump.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.500]   And I think he did.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.940]   So Renee's not here, he's in New York.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.260]   Not sure why, I thought at first he's not here
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.300]   because every time Apple announces his quarterly results,
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.860]   they do it, they set out an email
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.340]   half an hour before the end of the show
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.780]   and then they wait till the show's over
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.420]   and then they do it, the analysts call it.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.780]   I thought maybe Renee just didn't wanna be stuck
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.580]   on the microphone when he could be paying attention
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.820]   to Apple's quarterly results.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.880]   This is traditionally Apple's down quarter, right?
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.140]   Yeah, they got too much time between releases.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.100]   The usual previous years in which they've had
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.420]   a really good quarter this time is when they had
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.340]   a really impressive Mac release in the spring.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.700]   That obviously has not been happening for a couple of years now.
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.860]   So I'm not expecting much.
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.660]   I have to admit that the analyst call is not something
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.700]   that I pay a lot of attention to myself
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.740]   but I don't expect really great things for call at this time.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.100]   The good news is Renee and the Serenity call
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.500]   will transcribe the call.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.980]   So you don't even have to.
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.020]   But people will be watching with interest.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.620]   Market watch and others have pointed out
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.780]   that we can expect perhaps, or we can hope for,
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.780]   some subtle indication of when the next iPhone
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.260]   will come out because of course,
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.980]   if it comes out in September, it'll be part of the next quarter.
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.660]   If it comes out in October and there have been rumors
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.580]   that it will not come out until later this time,
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.860]   then it would not be included in next quarter's results.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.620]   And Apple would be expected to,
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:30.100]   in some subtle way indicate that maybe next,
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.460]   you know, in a forward looking statement of some kind,
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.180]   that maybe next quarter will not be the traditional,
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.860]   get the traditional iPhone bump.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.060]   - Yeah, and they could decide to play a little bit
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.900]   of gamesmanship.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.620]   If rumors are true that they are going to come up
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.740]   with a much more expensive iPhone in the fall,
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.180]   they might decide which quarter do we want those higher
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.060]   profits to apply to the earlier one or the later one.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.820]   - It's always been bad because you get a few weeks
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.260]   of iPhone in the fourth quarter.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.100]   Go ahead.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.740]   - They should have at least one surprise since we know
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.940]   that it's got all the biometrics and we know
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.340]   what the shape is going to be like.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.860]   They have to have one surprisingly.
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.820]   - Well, in fact, that's stuff we're learning from the
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.660]   HomePod.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.500]   - Yeah.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.300]   - Which is weird 'cause that doesn't come out
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.620]   till December.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.460]   - Yeah.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.060]   - So first of all, a lot of this is coming from
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.620]   the HomePod firmware.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.780]   How are people getting the HomePod firmware to begin with?
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.380]   - They released it by accident according to reports.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.180]   We just went out to the developer channels and anybody
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.380]   who's smart, if you see something, you grab it before
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.220]   it can go away and included and all that is all the helpful
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.860]   graphics that says, and here's how you set up your new iPhone
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.860]   with the new HomePod.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.780]   And there's an outline that actually matches one of the
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.060]   rumor profiles we've seen before.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.220]   We've seen rumors of a screen that does go all the way
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.860]   top to bottom so aggressively that you need an actual
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.620]   little tab at the top in which to put sensors,
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.900]   like the sensors in the camera.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.940]   And so that's what we're looking at right now.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.900]   I don't know if it was so much, I'm sorry, I'm about to say
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.460]   something I shouldn't say so I'm not gonna say it.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.820]   - And I know that, I know Adam XD you don't report rumors
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.580]   in tidbits.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.580]   - No, we don't.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.020]   It's one of those things where all the rumor sites get
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.020]   closer and closer and closer to reality as they, as we get
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.460]   closer to the announcement.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.300]   And it just feels like more information in your head
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.460]   that isn't right.
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.300]   - Yeah.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.060]   - Yeah, so we just avoid it until the actual release
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.220]   and then focus on the details because that's something
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.100]   people can use.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.300]   I mean, back in the day, it used to be more important to
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.900]   do rumor reporting because first of all, there were
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.900]   many fewer of them and people had to plan purchasing.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.900]   That it was a really big deal to know like when something
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.620]   was gonna come out so that you could say, okay, I'm only
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.020]   gonna buy, you know, or I'm buying Macs from my school,
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.860]   something like that.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.140]   I need to know when this release is happening or I need
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.300]   to know if this is going to be this sort of thing for me.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.660]   But the schedules, I mean the cycles are so set now.
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.220]   For the most part, it doesn't feel useful to people
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.060]   on that.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.420]   I mean, beyond the yes, don't buy something right.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.540]   Don't buy an iPhone right now.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.380]   - We know that.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.700]   - Right, but okay.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.580]   - I don't have to tell you anything about the iPhone
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.180]   to say, don't buy an iPhone right now.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.540]   - Put your hands over your ears and go, no, no, no, no,
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.420]   'cause we're gonna talk a little bit.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.780]   But this is more than rumors.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.740]   For instance, in the firmware, it's, by the way,
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.580]   Steve Strout and Smith has been kind of the most
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.900]   forefront on this.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.860]   He's the one who's done a lot of this analysis.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.340]   But Avery Menyadi has posted on Twitter,
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.020]   the new HomePod UI sounds.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.540]   And again, this comes from the, I guess,
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.060]   from that phony release.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.220]   Do you wanna hear these?
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.420]   Oh, come on, why not?
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.260]   Let's hear.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.100]   - I don't mind hearing it.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.100]   I just want to get a report on it.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.260]   - Here's the alarm.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:48.300]   - Sounds like crap in my mediocre $100 earphones.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.220]   Boy, if you only had a HomePod, you would love this sound.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.660]   Okay, is that all that we're gonna get here?
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.660]   Alarm wave.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.380]   Set up is fine.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.140]   This is Lighthouse, I don't know what that means.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.540]   Lighthouse might be, you know, on the Echo,
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.300]   when you first set it up, or it's got something to say,
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.340]   it does a little, the ring lights up,
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.740]   that might be the analogous.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.900]   - Can somebody please make an iPhone like Pong game
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.460]   that uses these as the sound effects?
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.300]   That sounds like it's perfect for Pong.
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.940]   - You set up step target.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.300]   Here's a timer.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.140]   That's pretty.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.620]   Your eggs are done.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.060]   Your eggs are done.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.620]   Your eggs are overdone.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.900]   Your eggs are hard.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.060]   Oh, screw it.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.020]   Ooh, that's the audio passcode tone.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.740]   Anyway, I don't know, you're right, Adam.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.620]   That was worthless.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.500]   That was a waste of your, that was five minutes.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.700]   You'll never get back.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.660]   (both laughing)
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.500]   Okay.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:55.220]   There's some iPhone face designs that are kind of intriguing.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.980]   These are the images you were referring to Andy.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.140]   And if you look at these,
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.180]   there's a couple that look normal.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.100]   And then there's one, whoa, hold on there.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.100]   Hold on, show me that one again.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.540]   There's one that has a, it's long and tall,
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.540]   and has a little, this,
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.860]   unless Apple has decided that they wanna use the Pixel 2
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.860]   for their home hub,
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.780]   I think this is probably the new iPhone, right?
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.700]   It looks like they took part of the design cues
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.300]   off of like Batman's tumbler,
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.980]   or it has those extended works in the front.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.940]   So this is,
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.940]   kind of what others have been doing, right?
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.340]   The small bezel,
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.660]   but in order not to make it super wide,
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.060]   this is what the Galaxy S8 did.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.940]   It's tall, it's an unusual aspect ratio,
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.460]   and that sort of implies it's what Apple's gonna do.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.180]   And there is this notch at the top,
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.420]   which could hold the front facing camera.
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.460]   I think you both have, I mean, it has to.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.660]   Not only that, but remember,
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.420]   it has to have sensors to figure out,
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.580]   am I being, is the phone being compressed against
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.060]   someone's face or not?
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.900]   If they are putting in infrared sensors
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.620]   for 3D face scanning, that's where that would go as well.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.020]   Also, the bottom does,
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.660]   and the screen goes all the way to the bottom edge
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.700]   of the bezel, as though there is not gonna be
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.300]   a mechanical cookie button in there anymore.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.060]   - Steve says the first one is probably a 5S.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.300]   I mean, that's pretty old, yeah.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   And then this new face.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.220]   So, you know, anything else you guys think
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.780]   is worthy of talking about?
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.100]   We're learning a little bit about
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.100]   this next generation iPhone, I guess.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.460]   I wish the Home Hub were out sooner.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.620]   I'm more excited about that almost than the--
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.860]   - You know, I get a chance to listen to it
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.500]   at WWDC, and it was really impressive.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.660]   Really impressive.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.900]   - I noticed that I am hardly ever using
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.980]   my Sonos speakers these days.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.860]   Not, they are probably the better sounding
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.780]   than the speakers I've hooked up to my Amazon.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.860]   But the ability to speak to you,
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.300]   just ask for music by speaking, is so great.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.780]   Now, you're a musician, Jim, so you might have,
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.540]   you know, the quality is important to you.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:20.500]   - Well, I think we've all gotten to the point now
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.620]   where quality and convenience are the most important things.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.860]   And I think if you ask most people,
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.900]   convenience is the most important.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.860]   - And there's good enough, right?
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.700]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.540]   - Good enough.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.540]   - That's proven by MP3s.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.380]   - Right.
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.380]   - You know, I have a set of future Sonics headphones,
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.220]   any or monitors that are about $1,000.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.460]   And the sound on those is impeccable.
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.020]   It's just great.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.140]   If I'm just going outside to take a,
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.540]   you know, five minute walk around the air
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.620]   just to take a break,
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.980]   I may just put in my Apple AirPods
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.380]   because they're good enough.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.700]   - And it's convenient.
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.540]   - Right.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.420]   So when you look at the AirPod, or yeah, the, no,
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.420]   the HomePod, and it's convenient,
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.860]   but it also sounds really, really good.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.860]   - So they, I heard it next to an Amazon Echo and Sonos.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.540]   One of those, you know, Sonos Play 3 or?
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.540]   - It was a Play 3.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.900]   It wasn't the five, it was the medium sized one.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.580]   And there was just no comparison at all.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:29.860]   - See if it's better than the Play 3,
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.740]   that is good enough.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.020]   That's pretty good.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.860]   - Right.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.540]   - It was noticeably better than either of those things.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.940]   - Especially if it sounds shaping,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.460]   which it's going to do, I guess, is--
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.300]   - Right.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.140]   - Yeah.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.940]   - So it was against a wall.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.740]   So it was projecting a lot of the volume,
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.900]   sideways and frontways, but it would send some in the back,
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.740]   but bounce it, and it knew that it was there, you know?
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.700]   So it would project the music where you are.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.540]   - That's very cool.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.220]   - And if you plug another one in,
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.740]   it automatically talks to the first one,
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.900]   and then they become stereo.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.900]   So if you are playing a song that separates channels
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.980]   in the music, then you get this feeling of, you know,
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.060]   depth and depending on where you--
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.940]   - If you plug in four of them, do you get quadrifenia?
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.140]   - I could not get an answer to that.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.220]   I told them that, you know, I wanted like six,
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.420]   but I could not get an answer to what happens
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.300]   if you plug in more than two.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.780]   - But that's what Sonos did right.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.060]   Sonos was smart because you buy one.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.860]   It's a, Sonos's are expensive, but you,
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.340]   maybe they'll lower the bar by saying,
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.140]   well, one sounds great, but what I found is I ended up buying,
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.580]   and then I bought another one and another one,
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.420]   and then the other one, and then one person
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.260]   had sent us all over the house,
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.540]   and I kind of insensitive to the thousands of dollars
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.060]   I was ultimately spending.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.620]   So Apple would be wise to do that, to have,
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.620]   you know, I know you could pair two for stereo, right, Jim?
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.460]   - Yeah.
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.820]   - Yeah, yeah, and the thing is, if you,
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.020]   if you set up a speaker and it's on a bookshelf,
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.380]   and you decide you're gonna have a party outside
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.580]   and you wanna take one outside,
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.580]   it doesn't just project the audio one time.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.420]   It's always sensing where it is.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.100]   So if you unplug it, take it outside,
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.100]   now it's open, it will readjust itself to send volume 360 now.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.340]   And then when you unplug it and take it back inside
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.580]   and put it back on the bookshelf,
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.020]   it will readjust itself again.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.100]   So, you know, it's not like you set it up once
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.620]   and then you're kind of screwed if you decide to move it
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.020]   'cause you have to go through a process to set it up again,
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.860]   you don't.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.060]   It's always looking to see where it is
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.220]   and where it's sending sound.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.500]   - So I'm worried about Sonos, to be honest with you.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.220]   They were, they had said by early 2017
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.500]   they would have echo integration.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.820]   In May they said they were gonna beta test
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.300]   and it's still not around.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.260]   And I think they've made a missed the boat
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.580]   as soon as the home pod comes out.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.220]   - They've definitely missed the boat.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.220]   - No, I don't think so.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.060]   Because when you look at what Sonos does
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.140]   and you look at what Apple is doing,
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.780]   Apple will not allow you with the HomePod
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.300]   to plug into your TV system for example.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.620]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.340]   - So there's no way to listen to, you know,
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.940]   your DVR shows through a HomePod.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.740]   Maybe somebody will come up with, you know,
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.540]   something that you can do with a life cycle.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.620]   - So there's no aux jack, there's no auto.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.780]   - No, no, no.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.060]   This is a music, I would say a music
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.780]   and then AI assistant.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.660]   But I didn't get the chance to see any of the AI.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.340]   - They'll have to improve Siri a lot though, won't they?
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.180]   If they're gonna.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.820]   - Well, I think some people, Siri works really well.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.540]   - Well, the rock.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.820]   (laughing)
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.220]   - When you've got an editor, it works really well.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.940]   - The thing that I actually, I think Apple's doing a good job
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.500]   with focusing the HomePod on music and the audio quality
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.540]   because I think that's what most people are doing
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.100]   most of the time with these so-called smart speakers.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.820]   And we have a Google Home for instance.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.020]   And what we found was the only thing we ended up doing
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.580]   with it was playing music.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.620]   Because every time we'd ask a question,
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.020]   it would get it wrong or say it can't do that
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.700]   or actually you would just say,
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.580]   I don't have a question you can answer.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.540]   I mean, I don't do bar trivia in my house,
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.340]   which is basically the only kind of questions
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.060]   that can answer in a useful way.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.980]   So, it just ended up being a speaker
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.820]   and then when I actually switched from Spotify
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.940]   to Apple music, it stopped even being a speaker.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.300]   So, it doesn't do anything now.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.060]   - We have echoes all over the house.
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.260]   We have Sonos all over the house.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.340]   And I just noticed that once I hooked up the echoes,
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.420]   the dots to some good speakers,
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.180]   I just never used the Sonos anymore
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.420]   'cause it's so much easier to say,
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.260]   well, play this.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.860]   I also can listen to audio books
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.460]   on the echoes, which I can't on the Sonos.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.020]   - Precisely. - Yeah.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:09.140]   It is a very natural interface to talk to your speakers
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.220]   and Apple's smart to capitalize on that.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.860]   And if that's all Siri does,
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.860]   but do we know, will it work with anything besides Apple music?
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.820]   - I not only-- - Go ahead, Jim.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.660]   - All right.
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.940]   No, Andy, go.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.300]   I just realized that I was about to talk over someone
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.940]   who has actually been in a room with one,
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.620]   or else I have not perhaps.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.620]   But so far, the answer to the question that I've been getting,
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.020]   but if I'm not using it with an Apple product,
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.220]   it's like, well, you have an Apple product
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.180]   that works with AirPlay.
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.660]   And you'll just AirPlay it to it.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.140]   - That's not the solution though, right?
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.900]   Because I can do that with Sonos as well,
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.780]   but that's not what I'm using.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.140]   - But that's okay 'cause Apple's doing something
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:48.980]   very, very new.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.340]   They're creating a brand new product
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.260]   that tries to mark out its own space,
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.020]   which is something that I think that
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.260]   they didn't do with Apple TV.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.580]   With Apple TV, they said, you know the Roku box?
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.860]   Imagine one that doesn't work with anything
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.620]   that isn't an Apple service initially.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.820]   They're basically saying, well, you know that
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.020]   the devices that you already know and you like,
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.820]   we're gonna do one, but we're gonna take out the space
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.540]   of really, really awesome music.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.180]   And it's an interesting spot to take
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.060]   because they're saying, what if you only spent
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.460]   not that much more than an echo, like the real one,
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.660]   but it was such a good speaker that it wouldn't
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.020]   just be good enough, you'd be amazed at how good it is.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.980]   But they're also taking the space where,
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.300]   oh, well, imagine that you're not,
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.060]   imagine that your needs for music go beyond
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.980]   what you would pay $129 for a very, very good Google Home
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.100]   or $180 for a very good Amazon Echo.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.580]   But once you start, for people who are spending $350,
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.180]   but it will not consider, they will not consider,
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.260]   well, for $350, let's look at what
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.540]   we can get in conventional audio gear.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.980]   Like, can I get a decent set of speakers
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.740]   that will plug into something that's already a good amp?
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.140]   How about something like the audio engine,
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.580]   audio engine makes them really nice little tiny, tiny,
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.500]   Bluetooth, USB, analog speakers
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.540]   that will connect to anything that you wanna connect them to.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.700]   I've got them connected to my Apple TV in the bedroom
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.060]   and you get that really wonderful,
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.500]   because they're two separate speakers
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.700]   and it's not a sound bar that's tacked to the screen,
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.900]   you really do get that room,
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.260]   that sense of space inside the room,
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.620]   the quality of the sound is amazing,
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.340]   so much so that it really made me wonder,
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.180]   do I have the right sound source hooked up?
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.100]   Because I can't believe these little dinky,
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.340]   what look like the Radio Shack speakers that I had
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.180]   when I was in college are pointing out something like this.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.340]   And meanwhile, outside of, it will again,
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.300]   hook up with Bluetooth, it will hook up with USB,
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.100]   it has its own DSP, excuse me, analog digital converter,
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.060]   it will hook up with multiple analog inputs
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.220]   and switch among them.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.740]   So it's gonna be interesting to see,
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.860]   I think Apple is gonna be very, very happy
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.140]   with the people who buy them because,
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.100]   who bought the HomePod because it's an Apple product,
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.860]   it works great with all my Apple products,
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.860]   I have great faith in what Apple does
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.460]   and then how they build upon it in the second year
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.060]   and the third year when they've already sold to the converted
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.260]   and now they have to sell to people
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.540]   who really are comparing this to a Sonos
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.500]   and really are comparing this to that $129 Google product.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.500]   - Speaking of Apple team, oh go ahead Jim.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.500]   - I have some Bluetooth speakers that I use
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.780]   if people come over and I just kind of set it up
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.740]   and we play music, it's a Yui boom,
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:40.660]   there's a couple of those and nothing that I have listened to
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.660]   or used or heard so far sounds as good as that Apple speaker.
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.100]   Now it's gonna be a lot more expensive,
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.940]   there's no doubt about that,
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.940]   but if you're going for convenience and quality,
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.300]   I think that they have a really good product here,
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.580]   I mean, you could just walk into a room and say,
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.180]   you know, play some classic rock
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.300]   and boom, it's gonna start going or presumably
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.860]   that's what we think will happen.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:16.980]   Now, my big question is, what else is it gonna be able to do?
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.140]   Are they gonna go for the AI assistant or, you know,
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:26.140]   the virtual assistant like Siri to be able to ask questions to
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.300]   or you know, things like that,
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.740]   can you be doing something else and say,
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.660]   hey, set up a reminder for me.
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.100]   - So what are people, I'm thinking what I use the Echo for,
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.820]   I use for kitchen timer all the time
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.300]   'cause there's one in the kitchen, I do shopping,
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.820]   but that's Amazon, so I don't know if Apple will have
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.940]   much to offer there besides creating a reminder list
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.620]   or a to do list or a shopping list.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:56.580]   But do people, I mean, do people call Ubers from their
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.180]   echoes, I don't have that, I mean, you can,
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.780]   but I don't think people do.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.260]   - I wouldn't.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.780]   - Yeah, I mean, you can, and of course,
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.300]   that's a Siri capability, but I'm just thinking
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.580]   what capabilities they would put in,
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.260]   I mean, they'd put the whole Siri in,
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.660]   but what would you use it for?
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.700]   I don't think answering questions,
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.620]   Google Home supposedly answers questions, right Adam?
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.740]   But you get tired of asking it questions after.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.380]   - Right, who won the Super Bowl in 1982
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.780]   is only interesting to ask once a year.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.620]   - Once a while.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.420]   - It's not a company, it comes up.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.900]   But I do think that--
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.260]   - And then I left out the one thing
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.060]   which is controlling the house, turning lights on.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.140]   That is very useful if you've taken the time to integrate it
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.380]   and presumably Apple could have some strategy
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.460]   that makes that really easy to do.
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.780]   - Well, yes, and HomePod is going to be a HomeKit hub.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.620]   - Right.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.460]   - So, there's a lot--
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.700]   - There will be stuff along those lines.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.980]   So, yeah, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.020]   I think everyone has their set of three to five things
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.540]   they use Siri for regularly and reliably.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.620]   And they may not even be the same for different people,
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.780]   but people don't use these assistants
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.460]   for a lot of different things.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.620]   They're really pretty dumb when it comes to--
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.020]   - Well, and we're dumb.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.060]   We're routinized.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.620]   We learn what works and what works
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.660]   and we use that over and over again.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.540]   It trains us as much as anything--
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.140]   - Well, I know if it fails, we never do that again.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:16.980]   - That's right.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.100]   - That's why I do mostly timers, it's really good timers.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.100]   - And that's what I use the Apple Watch for, the same thing.
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.180]   - Yeah, same thing, right.
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.020]   - Yeah.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:24.860]   - You know.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.700]   - But that's--
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.540]   - I think part of the problem with these virtual assistants
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:35.220]   and I said this yesterday in a short post that I did,
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.260]   the problem that I have personally,
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.340]   when I try to use Siri for something
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.740]   and it doesn't work and then it doesn't work again
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.300]   and again, then I just stop trying.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.140]   - That's right.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.700]   - So after a while, and it doesn't matter if it's Siri
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.620]   or Google or Alexa or whatever it is,
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.780]   whatever assistant you're trying to use.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.420]   And it was an article that Ben Behren wrote
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.420]   about Siri's job and what is Siri's job?
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.420]   Well, Siri's job isn't to do web searches
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.620]   and give you an answer.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.660]   That's not what it does.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.500]   Siri is supposed to help set reminders
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.900]   and set up appointments and do stuff like that.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.140]   But in early days of Siri,
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.620]   I tried to do all of that too and it didn't work.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.340]   Siri may very well be much better at that now,
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.980]   but I've become so frustrated
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.380]   by trying to use it that I don't even use it anymore.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:32.020]   So I could try to set up an appointment
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.820]   to come on the show today through Siri,
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.140]   but I went into calendar and I just typed it out
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.900]   because it was quicker, it was easier and I'm done.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.900]   - It's very embarrassing.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.220]   Every time I go to the dentist,
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.220]   one of the few places I make appointments,
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.860]   I'm standing at the counter and every time I go,
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.820]   I won't say it, you know who, hey, slow mo,
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.660]   set an appointment and it never works
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.620]   and it's very embarrassing
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.980]   'cause it always works when I'm not in front of somebody.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.980]   So it's just, and then now I'm that guy.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.500]   - And that's all that, for instance, reminders
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.060]   work really well.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.460]   So you can say, hey, slow mo,
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.940]   remind me to go to the dentist.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.380]   - I should do that.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.740]   - And that will work 100% of the time.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.580]   - Oh, that's good to know.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.140]   - You make it some weird text, you know,
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.380]   if it mistakes, what it will remind me.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.580]   But that always works.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.420]   But yeah, the appointments, I don't try.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.260]   - I can't.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.660]   - I had one Dave Mark this morning
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.100]   who works at the loop.
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.820]   Dave, a very smart guy, much smarter than I am.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:34.940]   Dave said, challenge me to start using Siri again
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.180]   and see how it worked because he said it works for him,
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.180]   just fine.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:43.020]   So he said, say this and do the, hey, girl.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.020]   - You're slow mo, yeah.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:49.700]   - Set a reminder at 9 a.m. to say hi to Dave.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:54.180]   And it came up and set a reminder at 9 a.m. Z on today.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.300]   (both laughing)
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.180]   - But at least you remembered.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.500]   - But at 9 a.m. - At 9 a.m.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.660]   - A reminder would go off.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.500]   - Right.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.100]   - So I said no, remove that.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.780]   And I tried it again, but then I couldn't speak.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.780]   I had to say, set a reminder to say hi to Dave at 9 a.m.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.820]   You know?
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.420]   So, but you're not gonna do that when you're out in public.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.820]   I mean, I'll just, I'll just type it in.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.180]   - That is part of the problem is doing in public.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.820]   Go ahead, any, you're trying to--
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.460]   - These agents have a lot of the same problems
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.060]   interacting with real people.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.300]   Like what am I, what am I, what am I,
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.340]   what am I best friend?
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.860]   - That's an interesting insight, isn't it?
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.100]   - Oh, well, given given how much trouble
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.100]   I have interacting with real people,
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.980]   I think that set me up very well for relationship technology.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.340]   But it's, one of my best friends, I didn't know this.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.220]   He had spent like his entire college career
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.380]   plus a couple years being that installing high-end car
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:51.380]   stereos.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.020]   And so when I just bought like a new stereo for my car
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.620]   and I was gonna put it in this, oh, when I come over
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.020]   and I'll help you do with that, I thought that,
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.820]   oh, okay, well, you mean I don't really need that kind of help?
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.340]   And so then, oh, well, okay, maybe it'll be,
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.900]   then I thought, okay, it's fun to spend an hour or two
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.140]   in the garage with a friend.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.860]   So he has come over and oh my God,
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.180]   he did the most amazing job installing this
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.020]   and he was looking forward to doing it 'cause he hadn't
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:10.860]   been able to, he was like,
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.500]   where I'm like the sort of person who just like duct tapes
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.340]   wires so they won't hire.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.460]   He was like doing all kinds of tricks popping up
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.220]   vents to run wires.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.020]   That what I'm getting at is that you have no idea
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.460]   what Google Home can do because there's no way to look
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.380]   at an interface and look at a printed up menu
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.220]   of everything it can do.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.660]   You have no idea that it can like change,
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.140]   you can say, hey, I'm running, I'm running late.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.740]   Can you re-book my Amtrak train for a later of train
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.100]   and then it can actually do it?
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.460]   I don't know if they can't actually do that,
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.380]   but that's the sort of thing that services itself.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.220]   When you're in someone else's house and you realize
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.820]   that they are doing things like making a change
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.420]   from an appointment on the fly as you say it,
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.820]   it's the sort of stuff that you have to keep playing
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.140]   with it before you realize that, oh, I didn't know
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.220]   that this can control my lights.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.140]   Oh, I didn't know that it's also, I can connect it to
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.820]   pretty much anything through if this than that.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.300]   I didn't know that I have a Plex Media server
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.940]   that controls all my media.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.580]   I didn't know that Aliyosha can, I can say,
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.620]   please play this content on this device through Plex
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.900]   and it will actually happen.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.460]   So that's where it falls short for a lot of people
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.820]   because it is designed to be no interface,
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.180]   no just ask it what to do and it will do it,
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.780]   but you have to know what is possible for this thing to do.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.500]   Once you've said to that first magic show,
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.740]   you really start to take advantage of it.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.140]   >> Okay, and to be fair, Google Home does give you
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.020]   that cheat sheet and actually they'll email you regularly
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.020]   with things that you can say to Google Home.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.620]   And I look at these things and I'm like,
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.060]   yep, don't need to say any of those things.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.300]   So you have to see it.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.300]   >> You find the one, but you find the one
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.940]   that you want.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.260]   >> Well, that's the rock versus Siri.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.500]   That's why they made that movie.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.420]   It was really, as I didn't really realize it
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.620]   till last week on Macquarie Weekly
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.740]   and one of you guys said, that whole point of that
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.300]   is to show you five things you could do with Siri.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.540]   >> And they all just work, but not necessarily,
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.900]   not reliably or not with the phone unlocked.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.500]   >> Yeah, it's okay for you.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.340]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.980]   >> That was my whole thing yesterday
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.620]   in reading Ben's article.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.900]   Ben said that Google Home or Google's voice assistant
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.180]   will always be better at general questions.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.900]   When does this hockey game start or something?
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.100]   Because that's what Google does, sir.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.260]   So it will always be better at that.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.100]   So maybe it's not Siri.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.000]   Maybe it's me.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.860]   Maybe I'm using Siri for the wrong things.
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.980]   And that could very well be.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.300]   So what Dave said this morning,
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.620]   I want you to try some things with Siri again
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.420]   and see how it works because it does work for me.
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.700]   I thought, okay, I'll do that
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.900]   because maybe I'm putting Siri at a disadvantage
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.700]   by asking it simple things that I just assume it will know.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.660]   When is the next formula one race on?
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.620]   And Siri goes back to 1936 and gives me some answer.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.540]   But Google can answer that for me.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.180]   So maybe it's just the wrong thing.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.060]   Maybe if I asked Google to set up an appointment,
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.140]   it would just explode.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.220]   >> So there are two basic categories
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.900]   for all of these devices, right?
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.060]   There's the canned commands.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.780]   Remind me to do this set of timer.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.900]   And that's just about processing the audio accurately.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.060]   But then you get the non,
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.500]   where basically the non-canned question
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.620]   where you've got to be able to parse out
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.060]   the interesting content in there
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.020]   and then respond accurately.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.140]   And all the companies are doing both, right?
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.860]   They want to make it as the canned ones as good as possible
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.420]   and then have the non-canned responses
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.020]   as accurate as possible.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.380]   And the second one is the really, really hard one,
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.860]   but it's the Holy Grail because if you do that well enough,
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.140]   you don't need to put any effort into the canned ones again.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.780]   >> Yeah, no, that's true.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.540]   >> Let's take a break.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.660]   I want to talk a little bit about some surprises.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.500]   Maybe we will have an Apple TV announcement this fall as well
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.820]   and I'll tell you why we think that.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.980]   But first a word from Zipper Cruder, our sponsor today.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.700]   If you're in the position of hiring at your company,
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.900]   the most important job, I will say this unequivocally.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.340]   The people who hire at your company
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.340]   are making your company, it's made of people
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.140]   and the right people can take your company to the moon,
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.620]   the wrong people can drag it all the way down
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.980]   and every single hire you make can go in either way, right?
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.620]   That's why you got to do it right.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.180]   And you know, if you've got an opening,
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.940]   I'm going to say this and maybe your experience
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.540]   will back it up.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.260]   There is the perfect person out there
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.100]   somewhere for that opening.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.140]   Somebody who's just going to knock it out of the park.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.620]   But how do you get to that person?
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.340]   That person could be watching one job board, not another.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.100]   They could be somewhere else in the country.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.660]   How do you reach the maximum number of people
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.660]   to maximize your chances of getting the perfect employee?
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.660]   Zip recruiter.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.700]   Zip recruiter lets you post to 100 plus job boards,
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.620]   including social networks with just one click.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.300]   You post on Zip recruiter, they post it everywhere.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.420]   And within 24 hours, you're going to see qualified candidates
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.340]   rolling in.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.820]   And they're not going to roll into your inbox or your phone.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.660]   That's good because you're going to get a lot of applicants.
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.860]   They're going to roll into the Zip recruiter interface,
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.220]   which is designed for this.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.500]   It allows you to do screening questions.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.620]   It makes it easy to--
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.500]   they format the resumes in a unified way
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.500]   so you can whip through this, screen out people who
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.460]   are just not going to make it, rank the rest,
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.300]   and hire the right person fast.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.980]   80% of jobs on Zip recruiter get a qualified candidate
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.660]   within 24 hours.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.620]   You screen them, you rate them, you hire the right person
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.860]   in their easy use dashboard.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.100]   You can connect with a huge variety of professionals,
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.940]   all kinds, IT professionals, Mac experts, whatever it is you
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.140]   need.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.540]   You need a graphics designer.
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.820]   Take your company to the next level today, more than 200
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.780]   million applications delivered.

[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.580]   In fact, more than a million companies use Zip recruiter
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.780]   today.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.220]   And if you want to apply, by the way,

[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.220]   Jim Dowrympel is here from the loop, loopinsight.com.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:03.860]   You're looking good.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.420]   You lose some weight.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.140]   I did.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.540]   You look fantastic.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.700]   You know, I wonder every week if you're going to call and say,
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.420]   come on the show.
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.180]   So I always try and look my best.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:14.540]   Damn.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.060]   Now you make me feel guilty.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.340]   Can we catch you one more?
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.500]   I love having you on, Jim.
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.580]   It's always a threat.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.220]   Always a threat.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.860]   I get tanned.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.500]   Yeah, you're looking great.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.300]   I fixed my beard up.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.100]   Looking fantastic.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.540]   Andy Inako looks exactly the same.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.220]   But he looks perfect to begin with.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.980]   He always looks good.
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.740]   No, it's great to have you, Andrew.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.740]   It's fine.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.940]   I understand if I'm on a panel with Adam and Jim that you would--
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.180]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.020]   I don't look as good as I was.
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.820]   I love you, Andy.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.220]   I love you.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.060]   I mean, you know I love you in your MOOC-Cal.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.740]   It's just I spend so much darn time in my charity work
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.180]   assisting elderly and sickly shutters.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.780]   I don't time to do all the road races and all the exercise.
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.180]   But yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.020]   I give too much.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.820]   I don't think enough about myself.
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.020]   It's every job interview.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.340]   People ask, what's your biggest weakness?
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.980]   It's always I give and I give and I give.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.780]   And I just don't focus enough on a little person called Andy.
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.380]   He does it for the kids.
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.780]   That's the--
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.220]   He's doing it for the--
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.340]   The elderly shut in kids.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.540]   The elderly shut in kids.
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.140]   That's what I mean.
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:25.060]   A lot of Benjamin buttons on my meals for Woolfrew.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.140]   It happens a lot more often than you think.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.260]   Actually, Andy's been doing great pictures lately
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.020]   of roller derby in Rhode Island.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.020]   Just love the Providence roller derby.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.020]   What is the name of that team?
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.300]   Providence roller derby.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.820]   It's just Providence roller derby.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.900]   OK, that's a simple name.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.820]   Easy to remember.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.140]   And obviously, is that serenity?
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:46.900]   No, that's not.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.260]   But there's a lot of serenity in there.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.220]   She does a lot of jamming.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.340]   So there's a lot of pictures of serenity.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.340]   It's so much fun.
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.500]   Her roller derby name is R2D2Nater.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.980]   R2D2Nate, yes.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.940]   R2D2Nate.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.900]   Also here, Adam Anxt.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.900]   Runner.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.820]   And I didn't mention tidbits.com.
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:08.340]   He's the guy behind.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.980]   He and Adam and Tanya are the people behind tidbits,
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:19.020]   the world's longest running Macintosh news source since 1863.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.460]   And don't you forget it.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.460]   I knew the Mac was coming someday.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:23.980]   We've been playing--
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.300]   Publish the first issues and hot type.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.100]   I tell you how long ago it is someday.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.780]   There'll be page maker.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:38.740]   Do you use InDesign or do you just type it up and put it on there?
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.140]   InDesign has no role in tidbits, unfortunately.
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.340]   Although I actually do use InDesign for other stuff.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.260]   And I actually really like InDesign.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.860]   It's one of those apps that--
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.660]   I don't know.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:50.580]   It works for me.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.780]   I think a lot of Mac users aren't aware of it
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.540]   because they don't do page layout.
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.620]   Everybody knew page maker because it was all new
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.780]   and the laser reader was new.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.700]   We all were doing 500 fonts in our new letter.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.940]   When I was doing--
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.460]   I did a bunch of books for Peachpit.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.580]   And I was doing-- I did what's called packaging,
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.020]   where I would actually write the book into the layout--
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.460]   Of me.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.060]   --in InDesign.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.500]   And so I got really pretty good at InDesign
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.020]   because writing in it every day for several years.
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.580]   And then I stopped using it for quite a while.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.620]   Just didn't have any three, four versions.
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.220]   And then at some point, I needed it again
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.980]   for take control stuff we were doing,
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.220]   for result take control.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.980]   And I had to start using it again.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.020]   And my fingers knew what to do.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.900]   Suddenly, I was option-clicking and control,
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.780]   kidding, command.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.940]   I don't know where this is coming from.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.940]   These keyboard shortcuts are embedded in my spinal cord
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.380]   at this point.
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.260]   I was so surprised to have them come back out of me.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.980]   Apple has a little bit of a problem.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.660]   They're kind of dependent on Adobe
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:57.380]   between InDesign, Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator.
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.500]   I mean, we use Premiere, although I have to say
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.500]   that allowed us to move to Windows.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.220]   And that's part of the problem for Apple.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.620]   All of these are cross-platform, right?
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.420]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.420]   And I think in some sense, the world
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.060]   has changed with Creative Cloud
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:19.620]   because you don't have this big ramp up to new PR all the time
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.620]   for the latest version of Photoshop and Illustrator
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.820]   InDesign and all that.
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.660]   And so we almost think about it last.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.300]   I mean, it doesn't just hit the media nearly
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.820]   as much as it used to.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.020]   But Adobe's raking in $59.99.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.820]   People use it, think about it, remember it.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:34.420]   Totally.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.100]   And unless it, those apps, it's interesting.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.780]   I watched my son who was used Chromebooks and whatnot
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.180]   in high school.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.820]   He could not imagine why you'd want to use something more
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.900]   powerful than I don't Google Draw or whatever.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.740]   Like, no, no, you don't understand.
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.300]   Photoshop is really, really more powerful.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.140]   It doesn't even the same ball game.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.860]   But what's kind of interesting is
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.420]   that Adobe's made noises and seems to be moving
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.940]   in the direction of putting at least Photoshop and Lightroom
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.660]   on the iPad in all their glory.
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.060]   Are they doing the same with InDesign?
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.580]   I haven't heard anything about InDesign.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.780]   I would be surprised, honestly.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.140]   It just doesn't feel like it could fit to me.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.580]   It's too text heavy.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.260]   But I'd be surprised, though.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.660]   Adobe's been doing amazing yeoman's work.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.660]   They're even getting Photoshop on Chromebooks, for heaven's sake.
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.340]   They want to make sure that anything
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.740]   with a web browser and a pulse, anything
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.500]   that's quite complicated and compliant,
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.060]   should be able to run Photoshop.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.980]   And that is the most democratic and wonderful thing
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.620]   I can imagine.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:37.940]   But I think it poses a little bit of a problem for Apple.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.660]   If it's moving to iOS, I'm sure Apple's strongly encouraging
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.380]   that.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.940]   But it's one of the reasons people who used Max for years
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.300]   and are looking for more pro products
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.940]   are switching to Windows, because they can.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.540]   What you use is Adobe's Creative Cloud.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.100]   It's not quite so easy.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:56.740]   It's interesting.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.900]   I've been doing an immersion in Windows 10
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.820]   for the past three or four weeks.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.020]   Not switching to Windows, not even considering
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:07.780]   switching to Windows, but now just to increase
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.940]   my proficiency in Windows 10 and make sure
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.180]   that I understand what that world is like.
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.540]   Instead of my away team is now a Windows 10
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.460]   UltraBook instead of my iPad Pro.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:18.980]   Oh, trust me.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.500]   Which one?
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:23.100]   And so it is actually a three-year-old version
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.460]   of the ThinkPad Carbon, which I--
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.980]   The hardware I adore this hardware.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.820]   Very nice.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.620]   And I've gone all ThinkPad.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.300]   It's just so nice.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:33.780]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.060]   And there is a lot of what to what you say that, well,
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.580]   I've got even Scrivener, my favorite word processor.
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.260]   There's a Windows version available to it.
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:47.300]   And because all my photo stuff is in Adobe Photo Products,
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.100]   which I only switched to when Apple
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.860]   decided to terminate Aperture, which
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.180]   is a pro photo after they absolutely loved.
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.060]   So there's so much.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.740]   But then you get into, I really, really
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.620]   need a version of Omni-Outliner for Windows.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.020]   If I were to switch, I would need to find
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.380]   Omni-Outliner for Windows.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.860]   These two, three, four tiny little apps that Apple
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.300]   either knows or hopefully--
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.140]   or maybe they don't know how important all of these little
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.260]   independent developers are to retaining people
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.180]   into the Mac OS.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.380]   I hope they know that.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.260]   I do hope they know that.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.620]   Well, the quality of Omni-Outliner is just impeccable.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.660]   There's a--
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:28.020]   It's vital at this point to Apple's continued success.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.420]   And they were--
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.780]   And they were-- remember, they were writing Mac OS 10 software
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.020]   before Mac OS 10 existed because they were primarily
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.660]   next step, the developers.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.020]   And so I think that will hold--
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.700]   in addition-- and then you add on the problems of, yeah,
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.820]   but how long is it going to take me
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.340]   to get used to Windows as a daily driver operating system?
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.060]   But nonetheless, that there are a lot of people
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.540]   for whom-- maybe this is the recurring theme of the show.
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.980]   But good enough is not an idea that
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.220]   should be denigrated.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.460]   If a designer of hardware or software or operating systems
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.660]   is trying to make-- I'm going to make the greatest operating
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:03.900]   system in the world.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.580]   And I can write so many different Wall Street Journal
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:10.260]   articles about how I can prove, parametrically,
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.140]   this is the greatest speaker ever.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.220]   And look at the charts of the ease of use and the amount
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.220]   of money to train people on this.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.860]   But then there are people who are like, yeah,
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.540]   but I don't like this aspect of it.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.660]   And I like the aspect of this on this other competitor's product.
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.060]   And the other competitor's product, it's good enough.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.220]   I never operate this engine to Redline.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.660]   This is just a commuter vehicle, so to speak.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.140]   So I'm proud there's so much performance here,
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.820]   but I don't really access or need that performance.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.060]   Maybe Apple doesn't care.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.020]   Maybe Mac OS-- there's increasing evidence Apple doesn't care.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:42.540]   Look at this.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:47.420]   This is a company with Mac in its freaking name, Mac Fun.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.340]   They made for years some of the best little plugins
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.580]   for your photographers.
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.460]   They're making Luminar their flagship product for Windows.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:58.340]   In fact, they're moving all the products to Windows.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.500]   That should be-- well, it's scary only
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.340]   if you really want to preserve the Mac, which I do.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.660]   But that's a little-- I think the Apple--
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:07.020]   I don't know.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.060]   I hope Apple's supporting--
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.700]   Well, you have to figure that Apple's ecosystem play
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:15.980]   is in integrating iOS and Mac and all sorts of other things,
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.980]   like cloud iTunes.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.660]   But they're getting such success with the iPhone, Adam,
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.460]   that they care about Mac OS.
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:24.340]   Well, they do.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.460]   I think they do.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.580]   But keep in mind, Mac OS is mature.
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.220]   There's not a lot of places to go with it.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.980]   And for the users, as we've been saying, it's about the apps.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.380]   The operating systems are really dull.
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.180]   Less and less important, I agree.
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.620]   Operating systems are not important.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.340]   The platform or the ecosystem is what's important.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:48.740]   And although Apple could be potentially losing some people
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.340]   because some apps are making it cross-platform,
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:54.100]   they do so many other things in the ecosystem
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:56.180]   to lock you into the Apple ecosystem.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.540]   The ease of syncing, the iOS and iCloud, iTunes,
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:02.540]   just all that integration goes a long way
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.380]   to keeping people on the Mac.
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.100]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.740]   I got a little sidetracked here.
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:16.780]   Mac rumors reader Thomas Jackson posted this in the discussion
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.300]   forum on the Mac rumors forum.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.540]   Some of the movies that he had purchased in iTunes
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.780]   are now available in 4K and HDR.
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.220]   You can't download them in 4K or HDR.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.460]   It just says it in iTunes.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.580]   Maybe you could check your iTunes folks and see
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:38.500]   if some of your movies are suddenly 4K or HDR.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.820]   Now, since you can't download them now,
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.300]   one has to assume that this is an indicator of something
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.860]   that's been rumored for a while, that there will be a 4K HDR
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.020]   Apple TV sometime soon.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.700]   Yes?
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.340]   Got to do something with it.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.340]   Sure.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.700]   Well, I think so.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:01.900]   If only to make sure that the user interface elements are
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.980]   up to par with what you see built into the TV out of the box,
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.540]   4K is actually not quite as important as HDR.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.500]   I've been talking a lot more with people who have better TVs
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.820]   than I do and work in these industries.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.580]   And they keep saying time and time again
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:22.340]   that their increase in resolution is irrelevant
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.460]   if you have non-superman type eyes.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.460]   However, if you have human eyes, you
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.020]   will appreciate the difference in contrast and tonality in HDR.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.780]   So HDR is going to be--
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.740]   if you want to buy one feature or another,
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.060]   you want HDR, you don't necessarily care about 4K.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:42.620]   But yeah, Apple, I do think the Apple TV needs a bump.
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:45.580]   They need some sort of differentiator,
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.460]   because right now all it's got going for it
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.260]   is if you want intimacy with Apple services,
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.020]   that's the only box that will connect to Apple services.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.340]   And given that the reason for that
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.460]   is because we're not allowing any other developers to create
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.580]   boxes that will connect Apple services,
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.420]   that's not a real point of pride.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.660]   I want this to be the best box that anyone can possibly make.
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.300]   In February, Mark Gurman wrote a good article
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.220]   in Bloomberg Technology, Apple vowed
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.740]   to revolutionize television inside.
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.780]   Look why it hasn't-- in quotes from statistics,
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.780]   Apple obviously doesn't share its statistics,
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.860]   but some analysts who are saying that Apple TV--
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:22.940]   well, actually even Luca Maestri acknowledged it
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:28.420]   that sales are decreasing for the Apple TV.
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:34.380]   E-Marketer says that the market share has gone down to 11.9%
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.180]   in January.
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.140]   That was down from 12.5 in September.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.980]   So it's dropping rapidly.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.020]   And if you think about it, why would you buy an Apple TV
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:43.580]   these days?
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.380]   The only reason is if you're really into iTunes,
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:48.380]   and that's what you need.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.500]   But there's so much competition out there.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:56.620]   Well, I use my Apple TV when I'm going to watch Netflix,
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.940]   when I'm going to listen to--
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.180]   But you don't have to.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.780]   But I don't have to, because even Comcast now
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.340]   has Netflix on its X1.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.940]   So you don't even need that anymore.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.620]   What I think everybody is waiting for, including Apple,
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.740]   is to figure out what they're going
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:20.020]   to be able to do with both live and DVR.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.780]   And a lot of the solutions that are out there now,
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.940]   and there are a lot of them now, are good.
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.940]   But they're not good enough.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.740]   And that makes people uncomfortable.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:36.140]   But this is the era of court cutting.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:37.980]   I mean, I think in the next three years,
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:38.940]   we're already seeing it.
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.500]   People are going to be cutting off the cable company
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.580]   and turning on over the top services.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.900]   And they need a box to do that.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.660]   If it's not built into the TV, they need a box to do that.
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.460]   So this is the opportunity.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.580]   Is that what Apple is ultimately going for?
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.780]   Are they waiting for that?
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.420]   I mean, they've said it's a hobby.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.140]   Then they said the future of television is apps.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:02.500]   And honestly, some of those apps, the television apps
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:06.460]   that they have on Apple TV are really impressive.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.180]   But to keep going in and out of apps,
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:11.300]   the little TV app that they made is OK,
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.180]   but unless your cable company is part of all of that
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:18.660]   and you can sign in, that's not as useful as what it could be.
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:24.460]   So I'm waiting for that next big step where Apple comes in
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.260]   and says, OK, here it is.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.740]   This is the ultimate in cord cutting right here.
[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.700]   And maybe too late?
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.580]   Well, I don't know if it'll be too late
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:39.900]   because Apple tends to do things in a very cool way.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:45.420]   And if you look at that little TV app that they have now,
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:46.660]   that is very cool.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:50.580]   If you have a subscription service that supports it.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:53.180]   So it's not cool for me.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.180]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:55.780]   So I mean, look at these.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.420]   This is the latest stats from e-marketer.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.380]   These just came out.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:02.660]   The 168 million people will watch a connected TV
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.620]   in the US this year.
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:05.860]   That's almost everybody.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.860]   Roku has 38.9% of the market.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:16.380]   Chromecast 36.9, Fire TV 35.8, Apple TV 21.8.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:20.700]   So it's falling behind rapidly.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.540]   And I think that-- who cares about that as a product?
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.900]   But it impacts how much money is Apple spending
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.980]   to keep Apple music relevant?
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:32.260]   How important is iTunes to Apple and its bottom line?
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.100]   I think very important.
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:33.700]   It's huge.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.980]   It's huge.
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.100]   I mean, Apple TV-- or I'm sorry, Apple Music
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.940]   is one of those big services that they keep touting
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:45.100]   that services is going to increase over the next three
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.060]   or four years.
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:48.620]   A lot of that is coming from Apple Music.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:52.340]   So they're willing to spend a lot of money
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.540]   to make sure that that continues to happen.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.460]   So put some of that money into the Apple TV.
[00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:58.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.820]   So what we can't seem to figure out
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.060]   is what the strategy is for Apple TV.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.980]   And I don't know that Apple can figure out
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:07.020]   what the strategy is.
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:07.500]   It's a hobby.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.500]   That's all they've ever said.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.060]   It's a hobby.
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:12.100]   Well, they get rebuffed at every opportunity
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.620]   from the major cable members.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.900]   Yeah, they hurt themselves by being
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.860]   so successful selling music, right?
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:18.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.020]   They got all these great deals in the early days of iTunes.
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.060]   Keeps people went, "Oh, Apple, so what?"
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.860]   And then they became the number one retailer of music
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.140]   and completely dominant in the music industry and went,
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.660]   "Oh, crap.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:34.900]   Television and movies are determined not to follow that path.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.900]   We're not-- Apple's too powerful.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.820]   We're not going to let them gain any more power."
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:40.740]   Right.
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.580]   Also keep in mind that changes to net neutrality rules
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.780]   can absolutely change the game for cable companies
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:49.700]   if they have the ability to simply--
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.220]   they can now simply say, "We don't care what kind of box
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.220]   you have.
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.620]   We don't care how you get Netflix.
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.500]   We don't see Netflix as a competitor.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.500]   Netflix is now a product that we can charge you extra for.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.180]   So there's a lot of wait and see happening.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.500]   I think one of the things that people are--
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:08.820]   we're seeing Apple not doing what the Apple TV is extending
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.300]   it in some obvious ways.
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:14.420]   So for instance, why isn't there a news app for the Apple TV?
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.420]   Apple could be filling that with its own content,
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.220]   just like it does with Beats One.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.620]   It could be linking to other stuff.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.540]   It could be doing a ton of stuff with that,
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:27.260]   because news can be video as well as text.
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:29.140]   I mean, you're not going to read text on your TV,
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.980]   but you would watch little clips of things.
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.340]   There's lots of that on the internet
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.580]   to link to or to Apple could commission their own stuff.
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:38.500]   Similarly, you don't really see user--
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.900]   you don't have user profiles.
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.020]   So an Apple TV is meant to be shared by everyone,
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.500]   but it's got all this personalized information.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:49.980]   So in a family, that automatically makes it a little bit weird.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:56.420]   And it does a little bit with HomeKit, but not very much.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:57.820]   If they're going to integrate--
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.460]   if you're going to have a HomeKit hub
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.020]   and be able to use Siri to control your HomeKit devices,
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:04.300]   why don't you have a Home app where
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.380]   you can see how you've set all this stuff up
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:10.820]   and potentially be able to adjust things from there as well?
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:13.700]   That they just seem to have dropped the ball, frankly.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:18.620]   So it's not surprising to me that the sales are going down.
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.220]   Everyone else keeps moving ahead, even if they don't have
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.740]   all of the integration options at Apple.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:25.340]   I think Apple would say to that, Adam, no,
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:29.740]   we're keeping our eye on the ball, the ball being iOS.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.900]   And everything else is--
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.900]   iPhone, iPad, and everything else is not even on the chart anymore.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:36.700]   I've said this before.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.020]   Apple is a huge company that still
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.740]   thinks like a small company.
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.060]   They have one product in its iOS.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.740]   Everything else is an afterthought to Apple,
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.220]   and that's their problem no matter how large they are.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:52.300]   The entire company is devoted to the concept that iOS
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.340]   is everything.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.860]   And it's very successful doing that,
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:57.780]   but that doesn't mean that that's the best strategy
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:00.780]   for all of these ancillary products, which could even
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:05.140]   do a better job of supporting iOS if Apple puts more
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.660]   effort into them.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:10.300]   So all of us have been around long enough
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.620]   to understand what I'm going to say here,
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:17.700]   and probably the majority of the listeners, too.
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:21.900]   If we take a point in time and Apple has done something,
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:26.140]   and then we look three to five years ahead and follow that
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.580]   along, then we can look back and say, oh, well, that's
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:33.260]   why they did that two years ago, three years ago,
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.740]   or five years ago, because they were
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:40.300]   working up to this feature or this set of features right here.
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.940]   And that's how far I had these companies have to think.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:46.180]   If we look back three to five years to Apple TV,
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.940]   it doesn't really seem to have moved.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.100]   And that's part of the problem that I'm having.
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:55.100]   I can't see anything that they did two years ago,
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:58.700]   three years ago, four years ago, that is leading to anything
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:01.220]   big that's going on right now.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.660]   You can see that in other places, too.
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:08.340]   I mean, look at the iOS App Store that all the very--
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:12.420]   we've got-- oh, developers can now respond to reviews.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:15.500]   Oh, we got the in-app subscriptions.
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.980]   The amount of movement in the-- actually,
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.580]   the changes in the App Store-- very, very small,
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.900]   since the very beginning.
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.060]   And you had not seen movement there.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.860]   They said it, and I won't say they forgot it,
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.700]   but they're certainly not doing paid upgrades.
[00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:29.820]   They're not doing demos.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.220]   They're not doing all of these things
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.420]   that people have been asking for for years
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:34.900]   and years and years and years.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.220]   I think you'll agree that in the past year,
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.940]   since Shiller took over the App Store,
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.980]   there has been more positive changes
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:46.620]   than what there has been in every year previous to that.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.300]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:53.940]   So Phil really has made some remarkable changes
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:57.940]   to the App Store in a very short period of time.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:02.700]   Now, I know that there's some obvious things
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.940]   to paid upgrades and things like that
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:09.980]   that are just a nightmare to try and figure out.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.220]   And demos, I'm sure that there's nightmares there, too.
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:15.420]   But with the amount of changes that have gone on
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:18.460]   in the App Store in the past year,
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.980]   I'm willing to bet that that's going to continue.
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:22.820]   I mean, so what are the changes?
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:26.620]   We've got the being able to reply to comments.
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:28.380]   So we've got a plot.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:28.900]   That's good.
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:33.180]   The reply is good. That's a real technology difficulty one.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:37.100]   Did Phil have the videos of the apps, the app videos?
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.100]   Did he even have some screenshots?
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:39.700]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:40.780]   The in-app subscriptions.
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:44.700]   The fact that it doesn't take six weeks
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.100]   to get an app approved now, they get a data depth.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.100]   That's different.
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:48.980]   That's huge.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.540]   But that's a different situation, right?
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:53.300]   I mean, that's just saying we had this policy
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:56.180]   and we've made it so that it doesn't suck as much as it used to.
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:58.260]   But it's policy hasn't changed.
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:02.900]   Well, in fact, we're going to get to that when we talk about Apple banning VPN in China.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.540]   That's a very interesting topic.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.980]   Before we do that, though, Andy, you've said an interesting thing.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:10.300]   And I want to let it go about net neutrality.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.900]   And really what you're seeing here is the cable companies,
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:17.100]   ultimately, are not letting go of the pipe.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.860]   Well, if it's not going to be HBO subscriptions,
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:23.260]   we're going to make it up as an internet service provider.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.940]   And we're going to do everything we can with the FCC
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.620]   to make sure that we have an iron grip
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.420]   over all the content that's coming in through that pipe.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:37.140]   Tom Wheeler gave an interesting interview with Fast Company today
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.460]   about this.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.780]   Tom Wheeler, former chairman of the FCC, who did, in fact--
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.380]   in fact, I think he came around.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:46.180]   He was from the cable industry.
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.660]   But I think he came around due to the millions of comments
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:53.780]   a couple of years ago and chose title two regulation of internet service
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:57.060]   providers to protect net neutrality.
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:01.180]   He says, essentially, that it seems to me
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:05.060]   that people who are championing rolling back those safeguards
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.100]   are the big ISPs.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:11.380]   Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter, and the Republican supporters
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.860]   and are not the people who historically
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:15.660]   stood for a fast, fair, and open internet.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.500]   He says, everything that's happening--
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.420]   Ajit Pai is not listening to the comments,
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.740]   because everything that's happening
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.940]   is really happening at the behest of the big internet service
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.300]   providers.
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.980]   That's kind of what you were saying, Andy.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.820]   I have to say, I think it's a important point.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.700]   Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.460]   Subscriptions are going down.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.380]   The way that people actually experience entertainment
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.740]   is completely changed from the way it was when any of these people
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.700]   entered this industry, even if they only entered it in the '80s
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.740]   or the '90s.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.620]   And they're not going to let go of an opportunity to say, well,
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.460]   if we can no longer be the company that charges you
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.620]   an arm and a leg for access to ESPN,
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:56.580]   and the way that we do that is by making you buy 500 channels
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.460]   you don't want as part of a sports package,
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.540]   then we will be the company that charges you an extra $30 a month
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:04.060]   to make sure that if you choose not to subscribe
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.260]   to the 500 channel package, if you want to stream ESPN
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:12.260]   at any kind of equality, you're going to want
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.940]   to pay up the rest.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:18.100]   But it really is--
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:22.300]   I'm not smart enough about the internals at Apple to know
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.540]   whether Apple's being incredibly shrewd and intelligent
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:28.260]   by saying that these are shifting sands that we're
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.260]   trying to build a TV business on.
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:34.300]   Let us wait to see where is the actual bedrock we can bound on.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.980]   Let's wait for things to settle down for.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.940]   Or whether this is just in the category of we like this market,
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.380]   we don't particularly care about this market.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.980]   We don't really see this as something
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.220]   that is an opportunity for us to do, the things that we love to do.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.940]   So we are going to wait to see where the parking spots are.
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.500]   And then as soon as we see an open space,
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.940]   that's we're going to go in, but we're not going to force
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.660]   our way into this.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.100]   We're not going to try to define ourselves
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.420]   as the greatest solution for this, especially
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.980]   because, again, there's so much competition.
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.140]   I don't-- the mantra of good enough,
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.980]   there are people that will just happily--
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.620]   they get a new Samsung TV or they get a new-- even a bargain
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.460]   TV off of an Amazon sale.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.900]   And does it have Hulu built in?
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.260]   Yes.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:15.460]   Does it have Netflix built in?
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:15.820]   Yes.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:16.700]   OK.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.500]   Why would I want to buy a box?
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.500]   Even if the Apple box will be a lot more--
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.140]   I'll give you a lot more privacy.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:27.220]   It will be a lot easier to use and will provide more opportunities
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.020]   down the road that they can't even imagine right now.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.380]   But again, they see a Netflix logo
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.220]   and they don't have to change from HDMI 1 to HDMI 3
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.220]   to get to it.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.580]   That's good enough for most people.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:40.340]   We're going to take a break.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:40.820]   Come back.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.340]   There's lots more to talk about.
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.700]   Andy Inako, Chicago Sun Times, always a pleasure.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.980]   Adam Inks from Tidbit, so good to have you.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.740]   And of course, from The Loop.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:51.660]   It's Jim Delrenb.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.140]   I just want to read one last quote from this interview,
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.420]   Tom Wheeler, former chairman of the FCC,
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.540]   talking to Fast Company.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:02.140]   It looks like the FCC is standing up for four companies.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.300]   When you really get down to it, there
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.580]   are four companies who are really the major beneficiaries.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.500]   Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and Charter,
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.100]   they provide the vast majority of high speed internet
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:12.980]   in the country.
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.540]   Four companies.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:18.100]   There are 1,000 companies where the early stage innovators,
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.420]   the kind of folks who bring opportunity and create new jobs
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.380]   will have written a letter to the FCC
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.340]   I did, saying their businesses will
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.220]   be threatened by the elimination of Title II
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:29.860]   in order to increase the power of the big four.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:32.060]   This is just an absolutely startling comparison.
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.220]   Four companies are going to get bigger and more powerful
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.780]   at the expense of 1,000 startups and tens of millions
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.900]   of consumers.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.660]   That is so out of whack is to be shameful.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:41.300]   Bravo.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.180]   We thought Tom Wheeler was an industry spokesman.
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:47.300]   No, he turned out to be a champion for a free and open
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.020]   internet.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:48.740]   Good interview.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:49.940]   Highly recommended.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:50.620]   We'll take a break.
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.060]   Come back with more.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:56.260]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom August.
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:56.740]   Is here?
[01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:57.740]   August 1.
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:58.860]   Can you believe it?
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.540]   What happened to the year?
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.700]   It's National Make a Will Month.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.580]   Now, I've talked to you often about LegalZoom,
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.900]   how we used it to set up our LLC and our trademarks.
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:09.820]   It's great for business.
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.540]   But it's great for families, too.
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:15.300]   Time to take control of your family and assets,
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.900]   preparing for your family's future.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.980]   If you do one thing this summer--
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.780]   I'm sure you'll do many.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.060]   But if you do one thing this summer,
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.820]   maybe it's time to get that estate planning kit.
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:24.740]   We got one.
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:25.460]   At least I got one.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.860]   It's just to do the whole thing.
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:27.500]   It's beautiful.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.980]   You get this great kit.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:33.860]   You can go to legalzoom.com/prepare to get the kit free.
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.060]   You will get, by the way, with it, helpful information,
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:38.420]   but also LegalZoom discounts and everything
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.860]   you need to stop procrastinating and start preparing
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.460]   for your family's future.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.580]   Even if you do nothing more, get this kit.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.540]   It's designed to provide the tools you need all in one place.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:50.780]   Whether it's a will or a trust, there are a variety
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.660]   of instruments you might want to use,
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.420]   you get special LegalZoom discounts,
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.900]   you'll get an estate plan checklist,
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.780]   there's an e-book, lots of information.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:01.340]   Now, remember, LegalZoom is not a law firm,
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:04.220]   and that's what's so great about LegalZoom.
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:09.940]   They don't make $350, $450 an hour on you.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.020]   That's why they can offer this free estate planning kit
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.180]   at legalzoom.com/prepare.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.820]   But they also-- and I love this--
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.860]   there are times you need to ask a question.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.220]   You need to talk to a lawyer.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.460]   And they have created a network of attorneys, independent
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.820]   attorneys in all 50 states, who will work with you
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.900]   at a flat rate.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.460]   It's not by hour.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.700]   Very affordable.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.220]   This works so well for us.
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.380]   I want you to try it too.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.960]   LegalZoom-- National Will Month for August,
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.700]   legalzoom.com/prepare.
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.580]   No obligation.
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.780]   No salesmen will call.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.980]   It's just a great resource to help you protect everything
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.700]   you care about during National Make a Will Month.
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.700]   LegalZoom has been around for more than a decade,
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.980]   helping families, helping businesses,
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.460]   and they're ready to help you.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.700]   LegalZoom.com/prepare, even if you've got a will,
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.980]   there are lots of things to think about.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.700]   Things change.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.620]   Maybe it's time to update at legalzoom.com/prepare.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.220]   Get that for free today.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:11.540]   Ah, we continue on with the Mac break weekly.
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:12.980]   What did I say I was going to talk about?
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:18.380]   Now I forgot about it, but I thought it was important.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.660]   Damn it.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.700]   Remember I said I was going to talk about that later on?
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.540]   Oh, China.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:27.620]   So this is relevant to the App Store.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.740]   And this is a-- I think this is a problem.
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:30.740]   But I want to know what you think.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.300]   I think this is a problem when you say, as Apple has,
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:36.420]   no, we are going to be the sole one and only source of apps
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.220]   on the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.980]   We are going to vet all the apps.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.340]   That's fine in the context it's been in.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:44.500]   But now you're in China.
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.700]   And the laws of China are changing.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.820]   They're going to change in Russia.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.620]   In fact, they just changed in Russia.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.180]   In February, VPNs will be illegal in China.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.100]   They are already illegal in Russia.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:58.860]   And now, because you're the one and only App Store,
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:02.820]   Apple's in this position, they have removed all the VPN apps
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:06.260]   from the App Store in China, preparing for this new law
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:08.300]   in February.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.500]   I think that they've been put in an awkward position.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.100]   I think there is a solution for Apple, which
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.060]   is to open up iPhone for sideloading.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.300]   But maybe it's too late to do that.
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.140]   It would be such an obvious one.
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:19.860]   Yeah.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:23.220]   This is one area where I think that Apple has a moral obligation
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:24.780]   to--
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:26.540]   I'm sure that this was--
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.020]   there were the discussions internal.
[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.820]   I'm sure that they were really sweating this out.
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.620]   But the power of a government to control its people
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:39.060]   through its denying it access to VPN encryption and anonymity,
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.460]   it starts off with--
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:43.460]   isn't it kind of a nasty thing that the government is doing
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:44.460]   this.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:46.940]   But also, when you're talking about a country like Russia,
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:50.260]   where journalists get killed, not they get harassed,
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.940]   not that they want to-- there's investigation going on.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:54.660]   We'd like to have access to a phone.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.660]   Journalists straight on get killed.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.580]   And these people need to have the ability
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.780]   to speak privately with one another
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:04.100]   to avoid getting murdered by their own government.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.420]   You have even worse governments in Turkey, where, again,
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.260]   it's not even, oh, well, gosh, this person was found,
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.660]   hanged in a prison cell, or gosh,
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.820]   they were beaten by 18 different blunt instruments.
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.940]   And we were going to rule the suicide.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:22.980]   In Turkey, you have journalists who are getting arrested
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:24.980]   and then killed.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.860]   And you have political dissidents who
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.820]   are getting disappeared and killed.
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:33.260]   And Apple-- I hope that I'm not overstating this.
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.980]   Hope I'm not making this sound like hyperbole.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:40.420]   But Apple has to decide what side of this argument they are on.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.900]   If it doesn't matter, I think that in China,
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:48.980]   that's unfortunate, but they're not
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.500]   noted for the same sort of stuff that's
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.180]   going on other places in the world.
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.820]   But they're just going to have to--
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:57.500]   at some point, they're going to have to face the press
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.780]   and say that, well, yes, we decided
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.180]   to not play along with this small government that
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.740]   doesn't have a whole lot of power over us,
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.100]   where it's not a big market.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:10.460]   But we decided that when this huge opportunity of this huge
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:14.540]   market opened up for us, we don't want to risk losing access
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.060]   to that market.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.180]   So I have deep problems with Apple
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:24.860]   agreeing to not to turn off what can be life-saving apps
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:28.020]   for a great number of people that have very, very little power
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.060]   in the countries in which they've chosen to live.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.660]   So I agree entirely with Andy in terms of the moral side.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:38.180]   But from a practical standpoint, if this is the law of the land--
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:38.820]   No, they have to do that.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.220]   --do they have a choice?
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.900]   By having-- but this is the slippery slope
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.940]   that you create by saying only through us can you get an app.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:46.820]   Now, Apple--
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:47.940]   Oh, precisely.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:52.700]   Yeah, this is the email they sent to one of the VPN apps.
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.260]   This is ExpressVPN, ready to notify your application
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:57.460]   will be removed from the China App Store
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:00.020]   because it includes content that is illegal in China.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.940]   Once you're doing business in China--
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.540]   and by the way, it's not going to just be China.
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:05.060]   It will be Russia in November.
[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.340]   It will be Venezuela.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.540]   It will be Poland.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.460]   We're seeing authoritarian--
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.540]   it will be Turkey.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.980]   Authoritarian regimes emerge all over the world.
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:19.740]   And Apple is going to have to agree to do what each one of these regimes says.
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:20.860]   Yes, they will.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:26.140]   Because it is the law of the land, Apple is not a government.
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.180]   It is not a military.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:33.700]   It can't go in and say, we're going to just ignore the law of the land.
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:34.820]   No, Google didn't either.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.660]   Google left.
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:36.940]   They just left China.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:37.900]   They left the market.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.100]   They can say that we're not going to participate.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.460]   We're not going to have an app store in China then.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:46.220]   We are close to being valued as a $1 trillion company.
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:48.180]   China is a huge market.
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:49.580]   Let's talk about Russia.
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.380]   Let's talk about Turkey, where it's not maybe quite so--
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:52.380]   Or do what Android does.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.780]   That's where it's sideloading.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.780]   They allow sideloading.
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.380]   I mean, they could always do it.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:00.700]   I'm saying that they don't have the option of violating the law of the land,
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:06.900]   but they do have the free and open choice not to do business in a land that is making
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:12.060]   them do stuff that, in their estimation, is going to lead to people getting killed,
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.060]   getting murdered.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:17.980]   Again, for me, VPN is I'm in a coffee shop and I don't want my password being jacked
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:19.260]   by some kid.
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.260]   In other parts, you will be killed.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.420]   If people know who you're talking about, the people that you're talking to will be
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.420]   killed.
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.420]   This is a serious problem.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:34.180]   And Apple at the very minimum needs to speak about, let's walk us through why you decided
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:39.260]   that playing along with this as a broad principle is an okay choice.
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:43.980]   Is this compatible or incompatible with that hippie, touchy, feely, peace-loved dope?
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:48.980]   Oh, we just-- we're here to improve the world, improve things for humans everywhere.
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:54.540]   And again, if people are getting killed because of could access to software or lack of access
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:59.540]   to software, they at least need to not be tone deaf and say, here is how we don't feel
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.980]   as though we are being hypocrites in saying this.
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:05.820]   I'm not saying they are being hypocrites right now, but I'm saying that at scale, at the
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.460]   scale at which they operate, they can't simply send notices to developers saying, oh, by
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:12.180]   the way, we're pulling your VPN apps.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:17.300]   They have to speak at a very high level about what this problem is for them and how they
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.060]   intend to navigate it.
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:22.500]   Because the next thing-- what if the next thing the Russia does says, oh, by the way,
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:26.220]   we passed a law that says that you can't have a phone with any encryption on it.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.020]   And we have to be able to have on the fly--
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.020]   I mean, it happened here.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.020]   --back to it.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.020]   It's probably going to happen in Australia and England.
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.580]   That's just around the corner.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:35.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.580]   And Apple has to have a policy, and Apple has to state that policy.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.820]   So Google does not have a play store in China at all.
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:45.700]   Google doesn't play in China, because, remember, Google was asked by the Chinese government
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:51.420]   to censor results of its search, and Google, instead of doing it, said, no.
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:57.820]   We're going to redirect all Google.cn searches to Hong Kong or Singapore, and we're just
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:59.420]   not going to do business in China.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:03.300]   But if you have an Android phone in China, and many do, there are-- you can download
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:08.820]   from-- there are other stores, and you can download, for instance, a free browser from
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:14.020]   the not-for-profit group GreatFire that has a VPN built into it.
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:21.500]   So there are alternatives in China, but--
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.700]   It's a very difficult position that Apple's in.
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:24.700]   It's totally hard.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:29.420]   But here's a question that I have also, which is that we're talking about apps in the app
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.780]   store right now.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:37.820]   Let's face it, Apple has tremendously reliant on China to build iPhones and iPads.
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:38.820]   That's the point, yeah.
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:39.820]   And Macs.
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:42.580]   And it wouldn't necessarily just be leaving this Apple--
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:43.580]   I mean--
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.580]   I mean--
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:45.900]   I mean, sales behind it might be leaving iPhone manufacturer behind.
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:46.900]   Right.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.460]   I mean, it seems to me that this is-- I mean, again, I agree entirely with Andy that this
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:55.140]   is-- Apple needs to be totally upfront about why they're doing what they're doing, and
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:59.220]   what the situation is, because it is hugely problematic.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:04.300]   But at the same time, they do not have an easy option.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:09.740]   Even with sideloading, potentially, they could be-- by allowing the sideloading, they could
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.740]   be breaking Chinese law.
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:11.740]   I mean, just--
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:12.740]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:18.100]   So people may not remember, but in January, Apple removed the New York Times from this
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.100]   app store in China.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.100]   Mm.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.540]   Dangerous type of agree that they--
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.540]   I agree.
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:30.420]   I agree this stuff isn't easy, but as parents teach their children, morality and ethics are
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:34.260]   what you do when the right answer is by far the hardest one.
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:35.260]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.900]   When it's easy, that's no big deal.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.580]   Well, there you go.
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.500]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:46.980]   And to balance things out and be fair, it's easy for Google to do what it did, because
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.900]   it doesn't manufacture lots of stuff in China.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:54.300]   As long as its ads get through wherever they're browsing, they still make their money.
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:58.420]   Which is not to downplay the importance of the choice that they made.
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:02.220]   But again, it would be a very difficult thing for Apple to do, but once again, there's going
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:08.700]   to be a time at which it's going to seem really stupid that at no point has Tim or
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:11.060]   anybody posted a letter.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:16.980]   If Apple could post a letter explaining why a bad antenna design is perfectly good,
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:20.700]   then they can definitely post a letter saying, "Here is our policy regarding how governments
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:27.700]   might try to control its people through an app store that we 100% control."
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:37.420]   The Apple and Android Google stores have pulled hundreds of scam financial apps in the store.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:42.860]   These apps use primarily, I guess, in the UK.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:47.060]   They're fraudulent online trading sites.
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:51.580]   And people have fallen for it and have lost, well, according to this investigation by the
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:59.420]   Independent in the UK, quite a bit millions of pounds to these apps.
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:04.020]   So here's an app called, for instance, Binary Uno.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:08.260]   She needed money because her pension wasn't big enough to live on, so she invested 200
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.660]   pounds of the company.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.380]   They called themselves brokers.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:14.580]   They said she was trading on the performance of Golden Stocks.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:19.140]   She ended up putting almost her entire life savings, 40,000 pounds in, and had a zero
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:24.300]   account balance one month later.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:29.780]   Basically they stole every penny from her.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.540]   Apple could pay that back.
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.260]   They have that kind of money.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:39.540]   The good news is they're removing these phony trading apps, both Apple and Google are removing
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:40.540]   them from the apps.
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:44.300]   I mean, this is a problem that, in general, I'm obviously not much less about the Google
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:49.540]   Play App Store or the Google Play Store, but we've been researching word processors and
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.740]   various other apps for some tidbits stuff recently.
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:58.820]   And it is amazing the number of apps that are just crut.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:03.300]   They're probably, quote unquote, legitimate apps that they are probably what they say
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.300]   they are.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:09.180]   But if you go search on word processors in the Mac App Store, for instance, you will find
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.940]   tens of word processors that you have never heard of from Chinese developers that all
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:17.420]   have exactly the same description.
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:23.620]   And they're clearly, I mean, I imagine they're open office clones ports.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:28.100]   And I imagine that they're just basically doing shelf space stuffing, where they can
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:32.300]   get these things in because they are nominally legitimate apps.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:37.500]   But every one of them has a slightly different name, maybe it has a different icon, and it's
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.500]   all the same stuff.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:42.780]   And so it's just the App Store, at least as more than a little so on the Mac App Store
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:48.820]   aside from what we were looking, but has gotten to be problematic if you even want to find
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.820]   something in it.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:56.420]   Yeah, that's absolutely true in the Android Store, probably even more so.
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:00.500]   I'm kind of surprised, though, that Apple hasn't done a better job of curating its store
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:04.180]   since it really does tightly control it, doesn't it?
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.180]   You would think.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:11.700]   They're pretty good at using their editorial control to promote apps that go above the,
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:15.220]   hey, guess who just came back from a two-day weekend at a remote in?
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:19.380]   I promise to teach me how to write an iOS app for only $48.
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.940]   But yeah, that's the most difficult thing.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:25.540]   I think that's the part of the responsibility of people who are journalists and people who
[01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:29.580]   are writers and even people who are fans to make sure that the good stuff gets floated
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:34.420]   to the very, very top because most people, I think that I shop for apps the same way
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:39.940]   that most people do, which is to just plug a few keywords into the search bar.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:47.780]   And even when I know what I'm looking for, it's like Pokemon Go and there'll be a Chinese
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:52.180]   remote control TV app that knew that people are searching for Pokemon Go.
[01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:53.180]   So it's going to try to...
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.180]   It's terrible, isn't it?
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:56.740]   So it's hard.
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:57.740]   We need humans.
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:58.740]   We need humans.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.740]   Earth reads humans.
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:00.740]   We need humans.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:01.740]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.740]   Here we go.
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:07.900]   Apple has reported many times.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:12.580]   It happened last year, purchased Carpool Karaoke, a segment that appeared with James
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:15.100]   Corden on the Late Late Show.
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.820]   And they have produced 16 half-hour.
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:23.180]   Now the Carpool Karaoke on the James Corden Show is short, but they've made half-hour
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:24.460]   versions of this.
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:29.660]   I don't know how this will play, but they're going to come out on August 8th.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:34.540]   And one week, the first Carpool Karaoke, and we have a trailer.
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:36.860]   Would you like to see it?
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:42.340]   Let's play it.
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:45.100]   So I'm going to rely on you hipsters to identify.
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:46.100]   That's Michael Strand.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.100]   I recognize.
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.100]   Well, I am at the very start.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.100]   There's Cordon.
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.100]   Cordon.
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:51.100]   And actually, that's interesting.
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:54.660]   They're not just doing musicians.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:57.660]   They're doing celebrities.
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.660]   So we have it now.
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:20:59.500]   Okay.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.900]   Is that Will I Am in the back?
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:02.900]   That's cool.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.180]   Oh, this is the app.
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:11.100]   Plan it to the app people, because that's Jessica Alba, Will I Am, and Gwyneth.
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:14.580]   So this is a little cross promotion then for the other show.
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:21.100]   Now, Michael Strand, I recognize footballer and host on GMA.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:24.420]   Don't know who these two are.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:26.260]   The guy on the left, I recognize.
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:30.020]   A woman in antlers, she's green.
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:37.540]   There's a girl on Felicia Keys.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.020]   And then I don't know who that is.
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.020]   Metallica.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.020]   That's Metallica.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.900]   Oh, yeah, there's James.
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:46.340]   Metallica and Billy, Billy Echner.
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:47.340]   Who's this?
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.340]   Billy Echner?
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.340]   Billy, Billy Echner.
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:50.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:51.340]   Yeah, of course I recognize.
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.340]   He shouts at people on the sidewalk, and it's very, very, very funny.
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:57.740]   We rarely see Lars Ulrich in the back seat, but there he is.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.580]   And I'm just going to presume the Kirk is behind Echner.
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:05.700]   And of course, they let James drive, and he should drive because he's a car fanatic.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.220]   He's got a lot of cars.
[01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.700]   Now we're in a helicopter and other famous people.
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:11.700]   Oh, God.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.900]   See, this is what I was worried about.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:18.740]   And so the great thing about the Gordon show is that I like the conceit of the Gordon show,
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.900]   which is that it's all in a car.
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:22.340]   It never leaves the...
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:26.940]   The only conceit is that they have to come up with some excuse of why they needed the car
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.940]   pool with them all up.
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:29.940]   Right.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.740]   But they get rid of that in like 10 seconds.
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:35.540]   It's the intimacy of two people alone in a car.
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:36.540]   There's no crew in there.
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.540]   They're all trailing behind other cars.
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:44.940]   And people letting their guard down because it's such an unexpected place to be.
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:49.860]   There was a friend Robert Llewell, and I think was the first one to do this sort of thing.
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:51.700]   They did a show called...
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.300]   He was just called carpool, where it was an interview show.
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:55.300]   I've been on that show.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.300]   I love that show.
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.300]   Me too.
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.500]   He literally gave me a ride from the airport.
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.500]   I got a pic.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:01.500]   You might know that.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.500]   We did a show.
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:07.700]   And what I was worried about is that it's going to be, "Oh, well, oh, you know what?
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.180]   You know what I've never done before?
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.700]   I feel like I should get a sauna.
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.580]   Would you like to get a sauna spontaneously?
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.140]   Oh, look, there's a place to get a sauna."
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:17.140]   Like J.L.A.L.L. is garage.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:21.340]   It's a wonderful show because it's just him talking about cars on YouTube when it becomes
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.340]   the CNBC show.
[01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:24.540]   It becomes, "You know what?
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:26.140]   Why don't we take this out for a ride?"
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:27.140]   TV producers.
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.140]   I swear to God.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.940]   They don't trust the intelligence of the audience.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.100]   They think, "Oh, they'll get bored."
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:35.980]   Here we are in Billy Bob's, Texas, with a mechanical bull that's been changed into a
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:43.380]   dragon so that Aria Stark and Sansar Stark, I don't know the actor's names, can ride it.
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:45.460]   Oh, that's hilarity, Will and Sue.
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:50.100]   Then we've got some sort of petty cab race, and they're in...
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:51.100]   This is...
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.300]   You know, Apple's done such a bad job with Planet of the Apps.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:57.620]   I fear for what is going to happen to carpool carrier.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:00.260]   It could be good, but this doesn't get me excited about.
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:04.660]   Now we're in a laundromat with a choir and the...
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:05.660]   It's Gordon in the backseat.
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:06.660]   There you go.
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:07.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:08.660]   Gordon makes some appearances, apparently.
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:10.180]   Also, Gordon is awesome.
[01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:11.940]   He's such a great host.
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:12.940]   So...
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:14.700]   But it looks like these are unhosted.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:19.580]   So, instance, we've got Sansar and Aria, and Aria is driving.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:23.380]   So it looks like these are unhosted somehow.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.380]   Which is not a good idea.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.220]   It's a self-hosting car, so...
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:29.220]   That's where Apple is doing this technology.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.220]   That's the autonomous...
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.220]   All of Apple's...
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:36.140]   All of Apple's self-driving car technology has been so that these celebrities who are
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:41.700]   not used to driving themselves anywhere can operate this car safely.
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.740]   Wow.
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.300]   I think I have to wash my hair.
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:51.500]   Well, Apple, you know what?
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.580]   They got the money to hire some good people.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:54.900]   They have hired some good people.
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:58.220]   Maybe they'll see the error of their ways.
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:00.300]   Maybe it'll be great.
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:06.460]   You got to love Vic Gundotra, who worked at Microsoft and went to Google and was in fact
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:12.340]   the interface on Google Apps to the iPhone team at Apple for many years, then was picked
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:16.020]   to run Google+, Google's nascent social network.
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:25.540]   Your left here currently is at a company that makes a very cool EKG device, Cartia.
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.380]   But apparently he just thinks that no one should use anything but an iPhone for photography.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:33.540]   And he posted this view embarrassingly on Facebook.
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:38.380]   So this is basically, I think, Vic throwing shade at Google in more than one way.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.620]   He says, "Forget Android, just get an iPhone 7.
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:45.380]   Look how great these pictures of my kids are in portrait mode.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:48.940]   You don't need a DSLR anymore."
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:50.940]   And then it's fun to read the comments.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:55.060]   The people who, you know, like Scoble say, "Yeah, you're absolutely right, Vic."
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:58.300]   And then the people point out, you know, the Pixel probably is a better camera.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:04.740]   And by the way, how are you going to add the iPhone is number 12 in the DXO Mark ratings.
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:06.100]   How are you?
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:07.500]   There's plenty of reasons.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:12.220]   And then somebody's pointing out, "We'll see the smudge in the hair with the portrait
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:13.220]   mode.
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:14.620]   That looks terrible."
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.620]   And then on a lot of them.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.620]   Pixel Peepers.
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:17.620]   And the wall.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.620]   You, Pixel Peepers, you.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:24.460]   I think Vic's prematurely saying it's the end of the DSLR.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.540]   But is he right about Android photography?
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.620]   No, that's just dumb.
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:30.380]   I just grew with that 100%.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:38.060]   Apple, I still think that the iPhone is the best camera simply because I need to point
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:42.380]   out that I will go out often with four or five different cameras because I'm testing
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:43.380]   out different things.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:49.900]   I use the iPhone 7 or the 7 Plus sort of in the mix as part of those things to compare
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:50.980]   to.
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:55.540]   And by far the phone that gives me the least amount of trouble where I have the decision
[01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.940]   to make to take a picture.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:02.980]   I lift up the phone, I press a button and a split second later I have a picture.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:06.660]   No other phone does a better job of that than the iPhone.
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:10.980]   And because it takes such consistently good results, I think that it is the best camera.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.140]   However, I did it.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:15.700]   This is timely because a couple of weeks ago, I did an experiment.
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:22.540]   I once again took out a pocket full of phones, including this, including the Asus Zen phone
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:30.540]   that costs all of like the cost like a pit of money, the new Samsung Galaxy S8, another
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:37.260]   phone plus had the iPhone, the latest iPhone plus I had my Panasonic Lumix LX10, which is
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:39.620]   a very, very nice like pocket phone.
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:40.620]   It's not a pocket camera.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:43.380]   It's not like a cheap blister pack you get at the drugstore.
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.140]   It's a very, very, it costs about as much as a phone.
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:50.700]   And so I was doing my usual walk around Boston, taking the same tourist photos with all the
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:55.900]   six cameras in my pocket and things are automatically uploading to Google Photos.
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:28:00.060]   And I realized there was an opportunity here because all the stuff was automatically being
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.180]   uploaded.
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:03.940]   And it was the exact same picture, the exact same framing.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:08.500]   The only rules I set for myself is that I can use zoom, but all other choices have to
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:09.500]   be done by the camera.
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.340]   It has completely automatic.
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:15.420]   So I can't, I don't wish this were brighter, wish this were just directly uploaded.
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:18.860]   And so I realized that now that this is all in Google Photos, I don't know which camera
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.220]   took which picture.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:24.500]   So I decided to go ahead and say, I'm just going to choose the one I like best of each
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.980]   of these sequences, put them into a separate album.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:33.140]   And then once the album is complete, I will then look to see which camera took which one.
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:35.580]   And I was expecting a mix of things.
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.740]   So I was certainly expecting the Galaxy S8 to do really, really well.
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:42.460]   I was expecting it maybe to do a little bit better than the iPhone because it came out
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:43.460]   later than the iPhone.
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:44.940]   The iPhone is last year's technology.
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:48.060]   The S8 is the later technology.
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:56.540]   Almost every one of them was taken with my daily carry phone, the 2015 Nexus 6P.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:57.540]   Almost all of them.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.100]   All of the latest Android phone.
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.100]   Not even the latest one.
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:01.980]   Almost all of them.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.220]   And because of the detail I omitted is that the other rule is that whatever the default
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:10.100]   camera app comes pre-installed on that phone, that's the app I'm going to use.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.300]   So no, I can't use like a raw lightroom photo.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:14.420]   That's unfair.
[01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:20.700]   And almost all of those pictures, the camera decided to use the Google Camera Apps HDR
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:28.420]   Plus mode, which is the most lifelike and the most powerful HDR mode, HDR app I have
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:30.020]   ever used on any phone.
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:34.340]   Now you can tell because sometimes it will take a few seconds for it to finish building
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:35.420]   this picture.
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:38.100]   And there are times where I'll be taking like bursts of photos.
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.460]   And then I wonder why is the phone in my pocket so warm?
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:43.380]   It's because it's still processing all these pictures.
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:48.820]   But it goes to show this, the intelligence from this isn't that, oh, well the iPhone
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.380]   is no longer the best phone.
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:55.220]   It's that it really doesn't matter what the lens is like and what the sensor is like.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.900]   And even to a lesser extent, what the image processing is like.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:04.700]   If you have synthetic processing that will be able to take whatever the hardware can
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:10.500]   do and fake a better lens out of it, that's probably more important than whatever is built
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.620]   into the camera.
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.940]   I was not expecting that.
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:16.860]   That was not leading myself towards any conclusion.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.340]   And I am shocked as hell, but that there it is.
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:25.060]   I'm pleased to say that the phone that I paid $380 for at a discount at a Black Friday
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:30.940]   sale happens to be my favorite camera phone, because it's gonna save me $700.
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:36.780]   >> You see, being a non-photographer, which I am, I suck at photography, I'll sit down
[01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:41.100]   and play music all day, but photography is not my thing.
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.340]   Literally that saying the best camera is the one that you have with you is great for
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:45.340]   me.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:46.340]   >> That's true, but that's true.
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:48.740]   >> Because, you know, I have my iPhone.
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.820]   It doesn't matter how good that camera is.
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:54.620]   It's gonna come out blurry when I shoot it.
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:56.780]   It's not gonna look good, but it's mine.
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:58.500]   It's something I have, you know, whatever.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.260]   >> Also known as the Heineken Filter.
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:02.260]   >> Yes.
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:08.500]   Well, the fact that I can't see the screen anymore because I need glasses, that doesn't
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:09.500]   help.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.500]   So I can't tell if it's blurry or not.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.140]   >> Let me put this in a way.
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.860]   Let me put this in a way.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:17.500]   It's true, the best guitar you have is the one you have as well.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:21.980]   But if you could strum a fender Stratocaster or your iPhone.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:29.460]   >> Well, I wouldn't use, yeah, I mean, that's obviously a great, I wouldn't do that on my
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:30.460]   iPhone.
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:32.220]   >> I'm just gonna put this in terms you'd understand.
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:35.020]   There's a lot of pictures you wouldn't take on an iPhone either.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.420]   >> Well, see, especially if you got the closing.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:38.820]   >> I don't have another camera.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:41.020]   So that is the camera that I will always.
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:44.180]   >> Yeah, but do you ever notice like you'd want to zoom?
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:47.700]   Like you're not gonna take it on your African safari and take a picture of a lion that's
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.700]   this big.
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:49.700]   >> No, they're not.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.780]   >> It's a cute little lion out there.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:53.780]   >> Aww.
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:55.740]   >> So there's some things you can't.
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:56.740]   >> Yeah.
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.940]   >> You know, I don't know why Vic posted that.
[01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:02.860]   It almost feels like he's just throwing shade at Google because he used to work there and
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:04.260]   now he doesn't like them anymore.
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:07.060]   But especially posting on Facebook.
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:09.500]   >> Yeah, that's a little bit obvious.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:13.860]   >> But yeah, I mean, the purpose of a camera is to take a picture of the thing that you
[01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:14.860]   want to take a picture of.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:16.900]   >> And sometimes the iPhone is the perfect camera.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.380]   >> Well, again, that comes back to you.
[01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:22.940]   That's why I think the iPhone is the, if I have to say which one is the best, that's
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:24.940]   why I say the iPhone is the best.
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:29.300]   I could take better pictures with my Olympus OM-D, E-M1, a photo that, a camera that I'm
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:31.100]   absolutely in love with.
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:36.180]   But if it were, I have to admit that if I happen to bump into George Lucas at like an
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:40.460]   airport and I've got a five second opportunity to get a picture of me with George.
[01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:42.820]   >> There's nothing better than the iPhone.
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:49.860]   >> And I have, well, not only that, but my LX10 will absolutely kick the iPhones, but obviously.
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:52.580]   >> Yeah, that's the Panasonic LX10, which is very nice.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:54.180]   >> The Panasonic LX10.
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:59.980]   But the thing is, the iPhone is optimized towards, we will get you a decent recognizable picture
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.780]   of you with George Lucas.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:05.940]   You will not have to like call a friend of a friend of a friend, see if Alex knows anybody
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:11.980]   at Skywalker Ranch that can say, hi, I tried to fancy pants it with this $800 pocket camera
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:14.220]   and I forgot I had it on the wrong mode.
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.620]   So it didn't actually focus.
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:17.140]   >> I've totally done that.
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:19.580]   >> Can we meet at the airport again to get the picture again?
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:20.580]   >> Totally done that.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:23.220]   >> So that's what most people want out of a camera.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.460]   They don't necessarily want the best picture they can get.
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:26.460]   They want a decent picture.
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:27.460]   >> And let's face it.
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:28.460]   >> And let's face it.
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:29.460]   >> We'll always deliver that.
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:31.540]   >> This camera phone, not just the iPhone, but camera phones in general, have killed the
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.060]   point and shoot market probably.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:38.020]   I mean, this for most people, this is the camera they have, is their phone in their pocket.
[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.100]   And it's plenty good enough.
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:44.340]   So I agree with that, but I wouldn't agree with the stip that anybody's saying throw away
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:48.500]   your DSLR because now you've got an iPhone.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.180]   >> Although I think part of the strength is dual lenses.
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.460]   Now Google's rumored to be doing dual lenses.
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:56.980]   I think almost cameras in future will have dual lenses.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.340]   That's one way to solve the zooming issue and also improve the, I think what Vic was
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:06.180]   really saying is the power of, and we all agree on this, the power of computational photography.
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:07.180]   >> Okay.
[01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:12.780]   Which is what I got out of that Google Photos experience.
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:17.660]   But yeah, I mean, it's, and also the thing that really got me to stop even publishing
[01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:24.420]   reviews that try to do a side by side by side by side is to remember that the, if you were
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:29.820]   to take any photo that your mom and dad took, I mean, I mean, people who are 10 years younger
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:34.860]   than me, that their mom and dad took on film, any phone, even like the most middle and range
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:37.420]   phone camera will take a picture that kicks the butt.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:39.220]   >> Of that little cartridge 110.
[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:43.100]   >> Remember we had the insta-matics for the flash cubes and then you wouldn't get the
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:46.380]   picture, you wouldn't even know how the picture came out until a week later because you had
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:50.300]   to go to the one hour photo and drop it off and then you'd get prints and the prints would
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.300]   be terrible.
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:52.300]   You throw away half of them.
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.340]   I mean, we've come a long way, baby.
[01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:55.740]   Nobody's denying that.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:59.300]   >> So my parents, in fact, I forget the camera we had, but it was one of those things you'd
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:03.940]   take holiday photos, you know, very Halloween pictures, things like that.
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:05.700]   But you didn't use up the role.
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:10.340]   >> So you had to, in fact, wait until you'd get the role to get them.
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:13.180]   >> And in September, you get pictures from last October.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.180]   >> Yeah.
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.180]   >> Well, look at that costume.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.180]   That was great.
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.180]   >> That was great.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:19.540]   >> Yeah, no, it's we've come so far.
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:20.540]   >> Yeah.
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:21.540]   >> It is magic.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:25.380]   >> I do want to give my parents some credit for being pretty decent photographers.
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:28.900]   They, I have, well, don't show this yet.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.380]   I have to log in.
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:36.860]   They took, they had, they had slide, they used slide film and we recently digitized all
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:38.860]   of the pictures and they actually came out quite well.
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:45.620]   I'm not going to share my, I got an email from somebody a couple of days ago saying,
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:47.420]   why are you always talking about your vacations?
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:48.780]   Stop talking about your vacations.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:49.980]   Stop showing your photos.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:50.980]   Okay, fine.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.180]   I don't want to bore anybody.
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:54.180]   Let's talk about Foxconn.
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:56.300]   Let's talk about the president's Twitter.
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:36:05.180]   Remember President Trump last week said Apple's going to build three big, big, beautiful factories
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.180]   in the United States.
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:09.020]   Apple went, huh?
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:13.140]   Maybe they are, but some speculation is that maybe what the president was thinking of
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:17.300]   is Foxconn, who makes the iPhones, actually Foxconn's factory in Wisconsin.
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:22.460]   They admitted they said, yes, we're building a multi-billion dollar factory in Wisconsin.
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:25.900]   Oh, yeah, this is Trump's tweet.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.220]   Trump Cook didn't promise anything.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:32.500]   Anyway, Foxconn is going to make it for sharp TVs, not for iPhones.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:39.500]   But anyway, let's take a little deeper because apparently Wisconsin is giving Foxconn a three
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:46.260]   billion dollar tax break, enough to buy everybody in Wisconsin an iPhone.
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:50.460]   So really the only person getting rich from this, according to Bloomberg Business Week,
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:55.260]   is Foxconn and its billionaire, Chairman Terry Gao.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:59.660]   If you look at the numbers, which they do in this article, it seems like a pretty good
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:03.940]   deal for Foxconn, maybe less of a good deal for the people of Wisconsin.
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:04.940]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:08.380]   Also, Foxconn has a track record of making these amounts.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:11.980]   So we're building these plants and they did this in Brazil.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.580]   They've done this other place in the United States.
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:19.140]   And three or four years later, the tax credits came immediately.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:24.100]   But the actual jobs, they're still working on those and it's still not actually happening.
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:29.540]   So anything new is about how Foxconn is doing anything in the United States or in the Americas.
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:33.420]   It's like, okay, it's a it's a nicely typed press release.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:37.140]   I like your choice of font.
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:41.580]   Foxconn, on high, the parent company Foxconn says is going to spend 10 billion dollars
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:43.100]   in the plant in Wisconsin.
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:48.060]   They've never spent anything like that over the last, it's spent less than nine and a half
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:51.580]   billions over the past five years on capital expenditures.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:55.180]   So it's not, it seems like that would be a lot of money for them.
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:56.180]   A lot.
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:58.380]   But three billion dollar tax credit.
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:00.780]   Yeah, that's bingo.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:02.460]   Attempts negotiations.
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.460]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:10.380]   Did you see, we've talked before and we've Apple's been ditched for its anemic GPUs and
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:13.700]   some of its high-end devices.
[01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:17.180]   But maybe there's a solution on the way.
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:22.540]   Nvidia has announced Quadro and Titan external GPU solutions.
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:28.820]   I almost, almost designed for Mac books with Thunderbolt 3.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:31.900]   You connect these up to your laptop.
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:37.300]   It's actually bigger than your laptop.
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:41.660]   And you have suddenly a very, very powerful graphics processor.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:43.900]   So it's interesting.
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.340]   I think it's not really just Apple.
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:47.060]   I think a lot of laptops.
[01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:48.060]   Absolutely.
[01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:49.060]   Laptops have benefited from this.
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:52.660]   It's funny though that these graphics professionals want to use laptops.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.700]   They, yeah, they want to use them.
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:58.620]   She's they want to use and also give some portability and also allows them to have the
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:02.140]   portability and be able to swap out cards wherever they want.
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:06.180]   Gaming is also a big deal where again, you don't want to have to spend $5,000 on a laptop
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:10.620]   and then have to buy another $5,000 laptop two years later because you need that extra
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:11.620]   nanosecond.
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:12.620]   Oh, that's a good point.
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:15.460]   It killed plus all the heat is outside of the laptop.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:19.100]   Or if you're using an iMac and Thor 3, this would make this would be a great choice for
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.100]   an iMac.
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.100]   And power.
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:25.380]   The great takeaway from this is that people think that USB that that USB C is, oh, well,
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:28.060]   it's a different type of connector for USB.
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:29.060]   It isn't.
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:33.340]   It's USB if it's you actual USB C built to the spec that Intel has put together, not
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:38.100]   just this cheap little knockoff that appears on some cut-rate Windows notebooks.
[01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:43.740]   It really is like a totally new bus standard that has really no limits as to what kind
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:49.660]   of an accessory you can plug into a notebook and makes notebooks almost the same amount
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:55.180]   of credibility that any desktop Mac or PC would have because if I can get the if I can
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:40:00.380]   get the rate array that gives the bandwidth that I need, if I can get graphics co-processors
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:05.420]   that you read that need, if I can get five monitors hooked up to it, why am I necessarily
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:09.580]   sweating about the fact that this box that I want to buy has no slots?
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:15.500]   Why don't I buy a really good notebook that can also be taken with me on jobs?
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:18.980]   And let's end with a on a happy note, shall we?
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:22.180]   Apple is teaming up with the Australian company cochlear.
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:26.940]   They do cochlear implants, which are really miracles.
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:28.420]   I know a couple people have had them.
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:32.660]   Maybe you saw the video on YouTube of a young girl congenitally deaf had never heard her
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:38.020]   mother's voice given a cochlear implant, which is basically something that replaces the cochlea
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.020]   in your ear.
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:42.620]   Obviously, only certain kinds of deafness are treatable this way.
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:47.740]   Attaches the implant to a computer on your hip and a microphone.
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:50.020]   And suddenly you can hear for the first time.
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:51.220]   And remember that YouTube video?
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:56.500]   It was just amazingly moving to see this young girl hearing her mother's voice for the first
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:57.500]   time.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:02.300]   Bitserve talks about his wife, Annie, who was deaf from birth, who has a cochlear implant
[01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:04.420]   and what a change it made for her.
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:10.700]   So cochlear is going to make a processor now that will work with the iPhone, the iPad,
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:13.060]   the iPod touch.
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:21.100]   So I don't know if this replaces the iPhone or just, I mean, the processor and the cochlear
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:27.700]   implant, or if it just makes the iPhone part of it.
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:31.780]   My understanding is that does use the iPhone as for a lot of the processing.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:32.780]   Wow, that's amazing.
[01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:36.180]   It gives you essentially upgrades and no lock in for this one device.
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.180]   That's fantastic.
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:41.220]   I use my iPhone with my hearing aids because they're made for iPhone.
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:44.380]   And it's really great because you can actually make calls and hear the sound in your hearing
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.380]   aids.
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:46.380]   You can listen to books or music that way.
[01:41:46.380 --> 01:41:47.380]   It's not full fidelity.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:48.220]   It's a hearing aid.
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:54.220]   But hearing aids made for the iPhone with iPhones assistive technologies work really,
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:55.220]   really well.
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:56.220]   It's a really nice solution.
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:42:00.980]   See, this is what I find so impressive about Apple overall.
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:07.380]   It's not just things that, you know, we've got this new feature for all of these people.
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:10.780]   And it's a cool little thing that they work on.
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:15.780]   I really believe that Apple cares about the shoes.
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:16.780]   I think you're right.
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:19.580]   And I really like that.
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:24.740]   I think the medical uses of the Apple Watch are another very, very good example of Apple.
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:25.740]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:28.900]   Because these are small businesses, they're probably not a huge number of people from
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:32.500]   Apple's point of view, but it's still, it makes a difference in people's lives.
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:33.500]   Yes.
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.220]   And I respect that.
[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:36.420]   Yeah, I do too.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:37.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:41.780]   We knock Apple sometimes, but I particularly knock Apple sometimes, but that is something
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:45.060]   they should be very much praised for.
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:46.060]   Let's take a break.
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:47.060]   Come back.
[01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:51.100]   Will I get a heavy metal pick of the week?
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:56.340]   And you probably recognize Metallica right away.
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:57.340]   I did.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:01.700]   And a lot more coming up.
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:04.900]   But first a word from a rocket's mortgage.
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:09.220]   If you're buying a new home, if you're refinancing your old home, yeah, sure, you could go back
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:11.020]   to the 19th century.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:14.180]   Do it the way we used to do it a couple of years ago.
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:16.940]   Go to a bank hat and hand.
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:23.420]   Ask a loan officer, please, can I have some money, present them with bankers boxes full
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:24.900]   of paperwork?
[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:27.020]   I actually was faxing.
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:32.660]   I had a fine fax machine faxing them documents on our last time we did this.
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:36.780]   We went to a big bank and it took them three months.
[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:43.700]   Now you can do it in minutes from your phone or your tablet or your computer without touching
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:45.180]   paper without meeting anybody.
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:47.140]   You could do it all with rocket mortgage.
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:49.620]   Rocket mortgage comes to us from quick and loans.
[01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.500]   The best mortgage lender in the country.
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:56.780]   And you can just see all those JD power customer set number one in customer satisfaction year
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:00.700]   after year after year that kind of proves the point.
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:05.300]   They really are beloved by their customers, both in mortgage origination and servicing.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:10.220]   And they love us because they created something just for the geeks, an online mortgage approval
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:15.380]   process, which gives you, by the way, more than just fast, it's transparent.
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.300]   You know exactly what's going on.
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:20.060]   You can understand all the details.
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:21.060]   You can control it too.
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:24.580]   You get to choose the term and the rate.
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:28.980]   And you submit all because of they have trusted partners in all the financial institutions.
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:35.660]   You submit all the financial information they need from the app, no faxing, no searching
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:37.900]   through the attic.
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:42.780]   And because it's all online, all through the computer based on your income assets and credit
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:49.420]   and rocket mortgage can analyze all the options in minutes and find the one that's right for
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:50.420]   you.
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:54.540]   You'll literally get approved in minutes, not months at rocket mortgage.
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:57.940]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans apply simply.
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:00.740]   Understand fully mortgage confidently.

[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:28.500]   Mr. D. Jim Dowerimple, loopinsight.com.
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:31.780]   He's a rock and roll maven.
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:33.020]   I am ready for you.
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:34.020]   Yes, sir.
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:35.020]   Okay.
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:42.260]   So every time I come on, I do not really a metal and not a rock one, but in between hard
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:43.260]   rock hard rock.
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:46.700]   Sorry, I'm not up in the terminology, the kids.
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:52.500]   No, I want to make sure that I get something a little something for everybody in here.
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:54.180]   So this week's pick.
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:55.180]   Yes.
[01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:56.180]   I've been saving this one too.
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:57.180]   Ooh, for you.
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:45:58.180]   For us?
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:45:59.180]   Ooh.
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:00.180]   Yep.
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:01.180]   Yep.
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:02.180]   Texas hippie coalition.
[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:08.780]   When you say you were saving it, did you have it in your beard this whole time?
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.900]   Texas hippie coalition.
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:11.900]   So anybody that...
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.740]   It's got a great name.
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:19.180]   That likes any of the other choices that I've given them over the times that I've been
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:23.300]   on the show will love Texas hippie coalition.
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:27.420]   Your picks have been absolutely right on every time.
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:29.500]   So is it kind of country rock?
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:35.540]   No, it's bluesy type hard rock.
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:43.380]   And the guy's voice, the guy that sings his voice is just, it's raspy and it's really
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:45.380]   strong.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:46.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:49.380]   Look at that.
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:55.380]   He looks like Charlie's Daniels, but he...
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:57.380]   Let's hear it.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:58.380]   Look at that.
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:46:59.380]   I love it.
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:00.380]   There you go.
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:01.380]   Yeah.
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:02.380]   This is awesome.
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:11.660]   Oh, I love his voice.
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:18.820]   If you didn't see the video, you would be so shocked to see what they look like.
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:20.620]   That's awesome.
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:24.740]   I don't think anybody's going to argue with him that this is real rock.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:25.820]   No, I think they're real rock.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:28.180]   I think they're going to...
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:30.580]   Texas hippie coalition.
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:31.580]   Yeah.
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:37.820]   That's on YouTube, Apple Music, everywhere you want to be.
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:38.820]   Thank you.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:39.820]   Jim Dow.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:44.700]   Jim, do you have any recordings we can listen to the Dow Rimple collection or anything?
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:50.220]   I have hundreds of recordings in my iTunes library that I did over the years.
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:51.220]   Are you going to release those?
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:53.660]   You got to do a Best of Album or something.
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:55.620]   Next to the beer.
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:56.620]   Maybe someday.
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:58.300]   I'd love that.
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:47:59.300]   Best of the beard.
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:00.980]   I like it, Adam Axt.
[01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:01.980]   TedBitch.com.
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:03.700]   You're pick of the week, my friend.
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:12.860]   Man, I feel like I'm just going completely in the opposite direction.
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:16.780]   This software comes from a Swiss company.
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:18.540]   I just somehow can't quite...
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:20.300]   Oh, the Swiss rock.
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:21.300]   Come on.
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:24.300]   Not like that.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:26.820]   So, trip mode two.
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:27.820]   Trip mode two.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:30.540]   So, it's a wonderful little app.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:32.060]   Second version has been, you know, it's new.
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:40.340]   But what this thing does is it lets you control by the network that you were attached to what
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:45.140]   different network-enabled apps can operate at all.
[01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:51.780]   So, for instance, and I was on a trip very shortly after this came out, and the hotel
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:57.140]   Wi-Fi was totally shot, and I had to use my iPhone for tethering.
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:01.220]   Totally fine, but when you hook a Mac up to an iPhone for tethering, you got to watch
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:08.460]   the data because Dropbox or Crash Plan or those kinds of things, iCloud Photo Library,
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:11.260]   they can just eat your data for launch.
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:13.060]   I mean, it can go really quickly.
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:16.620]   And so, what trip mode two does is when it sees a new network, it says, "What do you
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.300]   want to use on this network?"
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:23.740]   Everything, you have to approve everything specifically as it asks for permission.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:27.340]   Dropbox says, "Hey, I want to start syncing something.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:30.300]   Trip mode puts up, you know, let's say you want a lot of Dropbox."
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:34.100]   And so, you get to control that, and then it remembers for each network.
[01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:41.460]   So, if you periodically switch between different bandwidth capabilities, you can say, "Okay,
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:45.300]   I'm am allowing Dropbox on this one, but I'm not allowing Dropbox on this other one."
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:48.700]   Or Crash Plan just isn't necessary at this point, you know, whenever I'm connected to
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:49.700]   this network.
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:54.060]   So, it's a brilliant little app.
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:57.740]   Honestly, I don't remember the first sort of what's changed often enough.
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:01.300]   I have to look back at the PR or whatnot.
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:06.460]   But for anyone who travels, and particularly anyone who tethers to an iPhone, it is an
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:11.100]   absolutely essential little thing to avoid running through your data cap.
[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:16.020]   It is not available on the Mac App Store because it uses a kernel extension that's
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:17.580]   not allowed.
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:19.820]   Is it on the iPhone App Store?
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:21.820]   No, it's an actual app.
[01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:23.900]   So, you have to put it on the Macintosh, okay.
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:24.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:29.980]   And basically, I mean, I used to do this also a couple of years ago, I had to drop my son
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:33.100]   off at cross-country practice, and it didn't make sense to drive home.
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:36.100]   So I had to sit in the car and work on the school's network.
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:41.860]   And it was a useful thing there, too, because that network didn't have a lot of bandwidth.
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:43.100]   And I was on a laptop.
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:46.100]   I just didn't want anything else going on while I was working.
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:50.980]   So I got all these little custom network configurations, and it just does it automatically.
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:54.740]   So I don't know if you remember a location manager back in the day.
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:56.220]   Oh, yeah, wow.
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:57.220]   That's right.
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:58.740]   I forgot about that.
[01:50:58.740 --> 01:50:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:03.580]   I mean, it's the important stuff a location manager is the edge of things.
[01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:07.020]   But this is what you really care about because it costs you money in the end.
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.020]   Right.
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:11.020]   Well, this doesn't cost much $8 on the Macintosh.
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:13.300]   One data over it, it's paid for.
[01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:17.460]   And you have a bundle if you want to get it on your Mac and your PC.
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:23.460]   And it comes in SetApp for anyone who subscribes to SetApp, which is 10 bucks a month.
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:26.900]   And you get access to like 70 apps.
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:29.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.820]   Is this worth doing?
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:35.780]   Yeah, I talked about SetApp back in January when they were just beta testing it.
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:38.780]   SetApp is an interesting situation.
[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:41.060]   They curate very heavily.
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:45.860]   So the apps in there are really good apps, which is what you want.
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:47.300]   I mean, that's great.
[01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:50.940]   The only issue is not quite clear.
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:52.300]   I just did an article about it.
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:55.260]   I don't know three, three, four weeks ago.
[01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:59.540]   It's not quite clear if it's being lucrative enough for the developers because it's one
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:02.700]   of those chicken and eggings they have to get enough people.
[01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:03.700]   And it's a different.
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:04.700]   But what happens?
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:06.980]   So trip mode will always be in that folder.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:09.540]   I mean, it doesn't go away.
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.540]   Can you subscribe to SetApp?
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:16.100]   You have to keep paying SetApp every month for all anyone apps to work, but they don't
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:17.500]   change out apps.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:18.500]   No.
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:21.340]   In theory, the apps have all committed to be there.
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:26.820]   I guess it's a year at least, but realistically no one's going to take something out because
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:28.340]   if nothing else, they're not losing money, right?
[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:29.740]   The amount of making is much.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:33.700]   But what I've talked to the developers who are in there, they basically say they're not
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:36.260]   making as much as they would like.
[01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:37.940]   But they think that it's just still early days.
[01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:40.020]   I mean, it's only been out for five months.
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:43.340]   This has a pretty good, I do remember you talking about this last time you were on, but
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:46.580]   this is a pretty good set of apps in here for, well, how much?
[01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:47.580]   Six bucks a month.
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:48.580]   $9.99.
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:50.500]   $9.10 bucks a month.
[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:55.460]   So if you saw three or four apps in there that you wanted, this would be worth it.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:53:00.700]   So there's some, I mean, Ulysses is there.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:05.020]   Ian timeline, Merlin Project Express.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.180]   I really like I stat menus.
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.180]   So I just set menus.
[01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:10.180]   Precisely.
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:14.140]   And what I found actually, which is kind of funny is that there's all these times when
[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:18.460]   I'll be at a conference or something like that and someone will have this problem and
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:20.660]   I'm like, well, I know how to solve it.
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.860]   And there's an app in set app that will do it.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:27.780]   So some I wanted to do a YouTube clip, which he needed to download and convert to a movie
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:31.020]   so that he could put it into keynote because it wasn't working for some reason as a YouTube
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.020]   clip.
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:33.860]   And I was like, yeah, downy will do that.
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:37.420]   So I basically launched that app, downloaded the app.
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:39.220]   He gave me his thing.
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:40.420]   I gave him a movie file back.
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:42.060]   He popped it in keynote and he was super happy.
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:43.060]   So saved his bacon.
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:44.060]   Right.
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:47.060]   And you didn't have to pay anything because you already own in effect on that app.
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:48.060]   Yeah.
[01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:51.460]   I mean, I would never have gone out and bought an app to do that one thing, but I was going
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:55.020]   to download downy once and use it right then and there for that feature.
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:56.020]   I hope they do well.
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:57.460]   This is a very interesting idea.
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:59.700]   It's they're a good company, the Mac Paw folks.
[01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:02.820]   They're Ukrainian and they just, they're really, they're solid.
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:03.820]   They're thinking hard.
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:08.060]   They've been improving it in and they're really being very careful about what they take.
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:10.300]   So this is not back app store.
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:12.140]   I really like them.
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:16.620]   So you can either buy trip mode standalone for eight bucks or if you are a set app user,
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:21.900]   you can try it out for free because of your set app subscription.
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:24.820]   Andy and I coz pick of the week.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:27.380]   This is a free VNC app called real VNC.
[01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:28.380]   Oh, yes.
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.380]   You know what VNC is?
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:34.740]   It's the ability to remote access one computer from another device made 10 times more awesome
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:38.220]   in modern ages because now you can remote access a Mac from a phone.
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:46.380]   It can remote access a Mac or Windows machine from a $25, $25 Raspberry Pi.
[01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:52.620]   And it's a you just install this app, this app on whatever machine you want to control.
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:57.140]   You can then download a client app that lets you again access that app from access that
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:59.100]   device from wherever you want to go.
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:05.220]   And because there is a sort of like a central if you set up an account on real VNC and it
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:07.860]   will be able to communicate to a central server.
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:13.020]   Here is what my the IP address of this particular Mac is on the internet right now because your
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:15.820]   ISP will keep keep changing the IP addresses.
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:21.780]   So it means that you can be in a hotel room and decide that, Oh, wow, taking just my iPad
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:27.660]   mini with such a bad idea because I can't do the work I need to do with just my iPad apps.
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:32.300]   So you can just simply through the crappy hotel internet connect back to your connect back
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:36.980]   to your iMac running app in a full screen mode and just simply have everything that you
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:37.980]   need to do over there.
[01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:42.300]   It's even useful if you just want that little belt and suspenders problem of I think I've
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:44.740]   taken all the files that I need for this trip.
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:49.260]   I think I need I think I've got all the files in my Dropbox, but you forgot one thing so
[01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:50.260]   you can go back.
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:54.940]   So I can go back to your your Windows machine or your Mac machine, copy that into Dropbox.
[01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:55.940]   You got it good.
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:56:01.300]   It's it's it's also neat because there's so many places in the house if you have a larger
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:07.940]   family where you feel like it would be nice to have an iMac in the TV room as in addition
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:10.500]   to the the bedroom in the office.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:14.380]   But you don't want to go out and spend five six seven two thousand two thousand dollars
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.540]   on another Mac.
[01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:19.420]   But you know what you do again, you can't afford twenty five bucks to thirty bucks for
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:25.100]   a Raspberry Pi or maybe you have an old laptop kicking around from it from ages ago.
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:28.700]   And so you don't have to be able to run the full power of that Mac app.
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:33.620]   You can just run this little very very sophisticated little client app that will let you have full
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:35.420]   keyboard and mouse control.
[01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:41.420]   Really there is a little bit of latency that you can sometimes tell that you're watching
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:49.140]   a video stream as opposed to a live UI being backed by hardware graphical acceleration.
[01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:53.580]   Yes, but after about the first five minutes, you don't really notice that it's it's just
[01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:57.260]   a Mac or it's just a Windows machine or it's just a Raspberry Pi.
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:58.860]   So and it's free.
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:02.020]   They will they will start charging you if you want the more professional features.
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:06.460]   It's free for personal and home use, which means that it's missing some of the features
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:12.020]   that they would want to charge you forty dollars a year or more for things like being
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:18.060]   able to do multi factor authentication, things like being able to just drag files from one
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:22.380]   place to another access or a remote printer stuff that really isn't that important for
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:27.700]   people who once again, they just want to be able to run Mac apps on their iPad, for instance,
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:32.820]   or they just want to be able to be able to be in bed and they don't feel like getting
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:33.820]   out of bed.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:37.180]   But the only machine that the only computer they have with them right now is the company
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:41.260]   issued Windows machine, but they want to run their Mac apps from the from the computers
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:42.980]   in their home office.
[01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:43.980]   It's worth it.
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:48.020]   I once I will caution that even though it is free, it's not worth putting it on every
[01:57:48.020 --> 01:57:52.940]   machine that you might conceivably want to remote access because it does introduce a
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:55.340]   security hole just by definition.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:57.700]   It is it's enabling remote access to a machine.
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:00.540]   It doesn't matter how secure it is through this app.
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:05.100]   It's a it's a vulnerability that would not exist if you had not installed this app.
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:09.060]   I don't keep it running all the time on all my machines and there's only one machine that
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:11.220]   I even turn it on when I leave.
[01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:13.580]   But definitely worth playing around with it again.
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:17.980]   It is pretty freaky when like I have run Mac OS on this tiny.
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:22.460]   Little little little screen of this little like cigarette pack size device and oh my
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:24.620]   god it's it's a scene man.
[01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:25.620]   It's it's quite a scene man.
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:26.620]   It's funny.
[01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:27.620]   Wow.
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:28.620]   It must be hard to use.
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:31.980]   Hey, you mentioned before Andy folding keyboards.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:32.980]   Which one do you use?
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:34.980]   I was just curious.
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:36.580]   It just got one.
[01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:40.300]   I thought I make this a recommendation, but I want to overlap.
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:41.500]   This is go ahead and recommend it.
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:43.500]   I've got a box labeled mobile keyboards.
[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:45.620]   I was curious.
[01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:48.620]   This one is called as from I clever.
[01:58:48.620 --> 01:58:49.620]   It's $40.
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:52.460]   Although if you want to touch pad, it's $10 more.
[01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:54.260]   It's backlit, which I really like.
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:59.340]   In fact, you can choose from red, green or blue backlighting and it works great with
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:02.460]   the iPad Pro, but any Bluetooth device.
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:03.700]   Look how small it is.
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:07.380]   It came in that little small enough that you could stick it in your briefcase.
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:15.980]   It unfolds to a pretty decent, solid, frankly better than the MacBook Pro keyboard that
[01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:17.220]   has some real travel.
[01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:18.220]   It has all the keys.
[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:22.220]   The only negative on it is that the shift key is oddly on the right is oddly placed
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:23.380]   and tiny.
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:29.140]   And I keep hitting the page up instead of the shift key, but this is the eye clever.
[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:34.300]   And I think for 40 bucks is a handy thing to have if you use an iPad or an iPhone.
[01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:35.300]   Look at that.
[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:36.300]   You got a whole box of them.
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:42.620]   Yeah, I didn't lie because I tried to buy every keyboard that I could possibly find.
[01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:44.220]   Is there much of a difference between them?
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:46.420]   This is the only one I've ever tried.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:51.260]   I would definitely say so as a matter of fact, this is I think there is a company through
[01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:52.260]   Alibaba or whatever.
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:54.740]   It looks like the eye clever exactly like the eye clever.
[01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:56.860]   Yeah, this is called the X folding triple.
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:59.740]   You can buy it and they don't make the same mistake with the shift key.
[01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:05.140]   They have swapped the shift key and the question mark key and they've done it appropriately.
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:06.140]   What's the name of that one?
[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:07.140]   I might have to buy that one.
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:09.580]   They call it call this one the eye note.
[02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:12.060]   I know on the back, but it says X folding triple.
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:13.060]   Right.
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:14.460]   There's one company that makes all of these.
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:18.300]   But I have to say that this is my if you have to have something that folds in a shirt
[02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:19.300]   pocket.
[02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:23.220]   This is my favorite kind because the idea of having the central bed of it.
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:25.340]   Yes, it's very solid.
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:26.340]   Yeah.
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:27.900]   And it's it feels very, very good.
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:28.900]   It's small.
[02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:30.620]   It's about the size of your premium phone.
[02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:31.620]   So it works really great.
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:35.060]   This is that is identical to the one I have except they've just moved keys around that
[02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:36.060]   song.
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:41.660]   There was yeah, there was some controversy because a company on Kickstarter had a keyboard that
[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:47.700]   was going to fold four times, almost like a folding folding step ladder.
[02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:51.980]   And they were unable to make their original design work for scale.
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:55.860]   And then they came out with something that was this.
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:59.420]   And then a again, it showed up on like Alibaba.
[02:00:59.420 --> 02:01:03.300]   So there's some controversy as to whether anything.
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:08.380]   Well, it's I was unable to verify one way that other it's pos.
[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:11.820]   They said that they designed it and then these factories ripped it off, which is definitely
[02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:13.620]   possible in China.
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:17.660]   People who were had waited years and years and years for this really delayed product
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:21.540]   that looked nothing like what they originally had funded.
[02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:25.420]   We're saying maybe you just had someone put a sticker on something.
[02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:26.420]   I don't know which one.
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:31.260]   All I can say is I would it's a distinction for me because if they did invent this technology,
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:37.380]   I would like to spend twice as much money and make sure the real manufacturer gets it.
[02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:39.340]   Lacking any proof.
[02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:44.100]   This is too good a keyboard for me to say I refuse to use it until I know for sure this
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:45.860]   was stolen technology.
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:47.380]   There might be an ethical problem with there.
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:51.780]   But again, it literally I do not know what the story is and I've been trying to find out
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:52.780]   about this.
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:54.780]   But yeah, this is my favorite style of keyboard.
[02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:57.660]   Also, it really does look like a bridge.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:02:02.300]   If you look it from the side and that is like a suspension bridge sort of hinge.
[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:05.020]   But so very pretty.
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:08.140]   Well, there's a couple of choices for you.
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:12.980]   I can't find the eye note on Amazon.
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:13.980]   I can only.
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.780]   Again, they're going to be anywhere.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:22.740]   And if anybody wants a good deal on second rate folding keyboards, I can help you.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:24.900]   I can only ship about 20 orders.
[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:27.060]   Second rate folding keyboards.
[02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:30.700]   Remember, remember that remember this piece of work, the typo?
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:32.340]   Oh, that was terrible.
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:34.540]   The Ashton Kutcher inspired design.
[02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:35.540]   Yeah.
[02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:41.100]   Yeah, it's like, OK, bless your heart for keeping the keeping the phone clicking.
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:42.100]   Keep going.
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:45.900]   If you bought that, well, I guess it's your job, isn't it?
[02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:49.180]   Especially when it's something that looks like the dumbest thing you've ever seen in
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:50.180]   your life.
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:55.100]   I don't want to not be able to say this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:59.940]   And so my price of entry to be able to say this is the dumbest idea ever was to buy this
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:04.380]   and then actually use it for a few days and verify they have actually used this is kind
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:06.380]   of the dumbest thing ever.
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:11.300]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded this edition, this thrilling gripping edition of
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:18.260]   Macbreak Weekly Thrilling and gripping because in 12 minutes, Apple's quarterly results will

[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:56.380]   I lay it on a limb.

[02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:06.780]   talking about DEF CON and other cool stuff.
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:11.380]   I will also make one prediction for the sales call for the analyst call.
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:15.780]   I predict that Apple will at least once and maybe even twice use the phrase.
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:19.780]   We love the we love the Mac and we've got wonderful things planned for it.
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.860]   But we have some more to say.
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:24.700]   Someday we're still working on that Mac Pro.
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:27.540]   Remember, we had to go all the way back.
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:31.220]   I have complete faith in our new in the new communications director.
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:35.340]   Hey, you know what?

[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:38.940]   Think about that.
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:42.900]   I think somebody could tell it like it is.
