[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.920]   We've got lots to talk about.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.320]   Apple had a great quarter.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.440]   Well, how good was it?
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.480]   What were the highlights and the loan lights?
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.360]   We've got graphs.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.040]   Thanks to Jason Snell.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.680]   We'll also talk about the new book about Apple.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.200]   It turns out Renee's Reddit cover to cover twice.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.640]   He says it's a great book, but there are some flaws.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.280]   All that coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.720]   - Podcasts you love from people you trust.

[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.560]   the latest news from apple Renee Richie,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.320]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie, a good day, sir.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.560]   - Oh, and a good day to you too.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.760]   - And thank you, sir.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.680]   Also with us from office hours.global.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.920]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, hello, Alex.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.120]   - Hello.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.800]   - Andy is not online right now, but when he gets in here,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.160]   we will put him on, but it's just the three of us.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.880]   In the meanwhile, I hope you don't mind.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.280]   - Have you got a channel Andy for us, Leo?
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.360]   - I can channel Andy.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600]   I will channel Andy as much as I can.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.720]   I don't have-- - We're expecting opera.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.640]   - I don't have the sideburn.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.640]   - Virtual sideburn.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.880]   - Yeah, you need the chops.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.720]   You have the chops right. - I'll do the job.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.040]   - Donna-dum-a-roll.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.160]   Where to begin?
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.060]   PayPal helped spur the EU antitrust complaint,
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.520]   which was just filed against Apple payments.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.920]   This is, we hear this over and over again
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.960]   with these EU complaints.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.320]   It's usually a competitor that goes to the EU and says,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.600]   "Hey, that's not fair."
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.000]   - Apple's being mean to us.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.640]   - European regulators hit Apple.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.520]   This is from Bloomberg, Mark Gurman,
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.200]   Gillian Deutsch, with a so-called statement
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.920]   of objections yesterday, saying that Apple abuses control
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.960]   over mobile payments.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.480]   In particular, it's the Apple Pay Service
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.560]   tap to pay abilities.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.720]   And the fact that they don't let PayPal use it
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.360]   or somebody else use it.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.800]   - The NFC chip, basically, they control the NFC system
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.040]   and only they can use it.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.600]   Which has always bothered me a little bit.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.360]   NFC is open on Android.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.360]   What other platforms are there?
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.160]   On Android.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.200]   Apple's, in fact, when Apple first put the NFC in,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.920]   it wasn't used at all, right?
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.520]   I mean, it was just very--
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.800]   - So Apple doesn't ship sets normally.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.760]   They were experimenting with NFC.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.600]   I remember back in the Scott Forest all days,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.800]   they did like three or four years.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.440]   If we have an NFC chip, are we gonna put it in?
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.680]   There's no reason for it.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.240]   And then they only put it in as an implementation detail
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.600]   for Apple Pay 'cause they care about features.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.760]   But then a bunch of other people,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.880]   we can do neat stuff with it.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.400]   They're like, yes, but it's also dangerous.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.760]   That's why people put their RFIDs into envelopes
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.000]   so that people can't scan them.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.280]   And it's a typical thing where Apple wants control
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.320]   and they'll say it's for security,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.880]   but it also has financial benefits for them.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.280]   But the fines, in this one,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.120]   these are not your Deutsche,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.080]   like Nederlands dating app fines, Leo.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.960]   This is like, what is it 10% of the global profit?
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.080]   - Of revenue, not profits, revenue.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.760]   - Yeah, not profits, revenue.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.600]   - Revenue.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   - So this is the tap to pay, not Apple Pay.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.160]   In fact, Apple says that they're gonna begin
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.560]   letting third parties use the NFC chip to accept payments.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.960]   But in other words, small businesses could use the NFC
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.840]   to accept a payment, tap to pay,
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.840]   but they won't allow rival services to make payments that way.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.520]   - Yeah, that still goes through Apple Pay.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.560]   That's just an extension of Apple Pay and Apple Cash.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.200]   That's almost like a competitor.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.640]   What people want is actually not outrageous.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.400]   They want access to the NFC hardware.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.240]   They're not saying you have to open Apple Pay,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.600]   you have to let other people use the Apple Pay
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.800]   to use it with other companies.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.440]   Yeah, like that Samsung makes Apple, Samsung Pay,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.280]   like Google Play.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.560]   - Squares Cash app can't use it.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.680]   Samsung can't use it.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.800]   Google Pay can't use it.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   Apple says, "Well, Apple Pay rivals like Apple Paypal
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.960]   are still popular."
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.120]   (laughing)
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.600]   - Even without the tap to pay.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.440]   - You have to experience it.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.800]   - It also said that Apple Pay already supports
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.320]   2500 banks in Europe.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.840]   However, it will quote, "Continue to engage with the commission
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.800]   to ensure European consumers have access
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.120]   to the payment options of their choice
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.680]   in a safe and secure environment."
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.480]   It's blatantly anti-competitive.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.520]   I don't think safety is, I mean, you're gonna use safety,
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.280]   but I don't think safety is at risk.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.520]   - Yeah, I don't know enough about it.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.080]   Like, it does feel like from the surface,
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.720]   it's just a matter of getting market share and profit.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.760]   Like, it doesn't feel like a, like,
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.040]   obviously I'm not always that way about what Apple's doing,
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.400]   but in this one I kind of go,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.240]   "I don't know." - I say we built
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.400]   this platform.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.160]   We're gonna use this platform.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.480]   You build your platform. - It's ours.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.320]   It's ours.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.520]   You build your platform, you wanna do that.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.080]   - I mean, I think that at some point,
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.240]   I think Apple will just drag it out as long as they can,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.640]   because at some point there's a certain level of mass
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.840]   that they have within the ecosystem,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.800]   that it won't really matter.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.720]   I mean, I hate PayPal.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.160]   Oh my God, I just was like, yeah.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.720]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't mind not paying PayPal, but yeah.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.640]   - So the thing is, is that I hate using PayPal.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.080]   And so I think that,
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.080]   I don't think PayPal is gonna get that much of an uptick.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.360]   I think that even if they got tapped to pay,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.400]   it would probably be some small percentage of users.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.920]   I think what Apple wants to do is get as far out ahead,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.040]   as, you know, once you start using Apple Pay,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.200]   the problem is that it's so seamless and so easy to use,
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.000]   the chances of using something else.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.600]   - That's my problem is,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.320]   I see I can pay for something online with Apple Pay.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.000]   - Well, you don't wanna get on your fingers,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.840]   just itching, but you know,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.000]   stick your fingers moving.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.840]   - Yeah.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.920]   - If so, pull it over there.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.560]   - To be clear, this is not me tapping this
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.160]   on a square cash, I do use Apple Pay all the time
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.200]   on Square's cash registry, point of sale stuff.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.120]   This is somebody coming up to me with their iPhone
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.440]   and paying me on my iPhone.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.800]   - It's you using a Square app instead of Apple Pay
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.800]   to make the transaction,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.600]   'cause right now you have to use Apple's whole thing.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.040]   And like, this is like a huge battle
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.000]   and it's not unique to Apple.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.040]   We have this tension between dumb pipe hardware
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.800]   and controlling services,
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.360]   and it's the same battle that the carriers go through.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.400]   They don't wanna be dumb pipe internet services.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.240]   They want you to have to use everything that they do.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.320]   They have better lobbyists,
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.240]   so they never get attacked by any government ever
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.720]   at any time, but the tech companies aren't that smart.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.200]   So they make all this to hardware
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.720]   and then they wanna reap the benefits of it,
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.320]   but meanwhile they wanna have be a platform
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.800]   and have reap the benefits of that too,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.160]   and they get squashed right in the middle.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.000]   - Right.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.240]   - So-- - But I think that--
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.760]   - Go ahead.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.040]   - I think that eventually Apple will lose this fight,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.760]   but they'll drag it out maybe for a year or two,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.280]   and then by then they will not have to worry about it.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.040]   I mean, I think that-- - The fines are so big though.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.200]   - I think that the change in usage of, for PayPal,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.400]   I mean, a lot of people use PayPal
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.120]   and they will continue to use PayPal and PayPal.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.440]   But I bet you this will not have more than a 5% impact on there,
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.120]   because I just don't think that many people
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.220]   on the Apple platform will change.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.040]   I will say that it is a pain.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.480]   Someone sent something to me and I gotta send the money,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.120]   and without Apple Pay, I don't like in Europe by,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.280]   you know, to them, I'm not gonna have that.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.760]   - A lot of people in Europe don't have credit cards.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.720]   Like PayPal is hugely important to people in Europe
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.120]   because they don't use credit cards the way we do.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.360]   I think we think we were growing up.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.240]   I always thought they did
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.040]   'cause we saw like master the possibilities,
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.440]   Visa accepted everywhere in the world.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.680]   Turns out they don't use it
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.720]   and they always say like, if there's no PayPal option,
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.680]   literally can't sign up for your thing.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.520]   So it's a huge problem.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.480]   And my guess is that these fines are so aggressive,
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.440]   they have $40 billion or something
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.800]   that Apple is gonna have to roll out an API
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   and what they're gonna do is make an entitlement
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.600]   because they don't want anybody to be able to use this
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.320]   because then there will be a bunch of scam apps
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.160]   that try to download-- - That's a fair solution.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.320]   Yeah, so make it a entitlement.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.680]   - So you have to get through the App Store,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.520]   which you would anyway,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.040]   and you have to request the entitlement
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.040]   to use TAP to pay Apple approval.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.960]   Yeah, that seems like a sensible solution.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.280]   - So I'm unclear on what a statement of objections means.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.880]   It sounds like this has been something
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.760]   that's been going on,
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.800]   a probe that's been going on for about two years.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.680]   So this moves that forward.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.040]   And if confirmed according to Bloomberg,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.920]   I don't know what that means,
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.120]   confirmed by whom, the, I don't know,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.720]   the company-- - The Lords and Ladies of Europe.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.480]   - The Lords of the Lords of the Lords of the Lords of the
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.880]   - Yes, if Europe, the company could face hefty fines
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.240]   under EU antitrust rules.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.520]   And those are the 10% of revenues that we're talking about.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.080]   - All right, well, we'll watch with interest.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.680]   I think Apple's gonna do some, obviously, about that.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.160]   - It's interesting how international companies
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.760]   have to be so mega-regionalized now.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.040]   Like in the beginning, it was just Google and Apple
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.200]   were completely, everything was the same everywhere.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.160]   And now all these jurisdictions are creating new laws
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.920]   and different requirements and different lawsuits
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.840]   and regulations.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.480]   And it's gonna be interesting to see how they balance
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.520]   all of that.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.840]   - Yeah, my initial reaction is to feel bad for them.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.400]   Like, well, it's really hard to be a business these days.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.680]   You gotta consider all these different jurisdictions.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.280]   But on the other hand, you could just--
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.480]   - You could just-- - On the other hand,
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.080]   there's a lot of reasons to go for it.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.880]   And after all, if they didn't want to,
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.400]   they could just say, well, we're US only in operation.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.120]   - But I think that it will be interesting to see
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.640]   if Apple goes down the path as the EU keeps on doing
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.800]   the things that it does, whether Apple will go down the path
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.720]   of just having an EU build for the OS
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.760]   that is different-- - That doesn't necessarily work.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.040]   - Doesn't necessarily work anywhere else.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.880]   - It's just like work.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.600]   - It's possible to do Samsung does that.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.240]   Samsung has different phones for many--
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.080]   - Exynos, right?
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.240]   And they're called-- - Yeah, they're all com.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.400]   - They have different-- not only different processors,
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.520]   they have different builds.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.680]   Yeah, there's a whole-- - So are you saying
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.120]   another lens dating iPhone?
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.040]   Will be a reality, Alex?
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.480]   Is that what you get exactly?
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.760]   - If you want to date in the Netherlands--
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.400]   - It's gonna be red, like the red district.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.800]   - You must use the orange phone, yeah.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.320]   - The red phone. - The red orange phone.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.160]   - That's what they should do.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.800]   They should give-- they should sell it
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.920]   and Europe and have its own OS and its own hardware.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.040]   But it'll be some horrible color, like lime green.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.560]   - It'll be like lime green and it'll do this here.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.800]   Here's what you get to buy.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.120]   Otherwise you can-- - Like leisure suit colors.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.960]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.800]   - Today's statement-- - What are you doing?
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   - Flat. - This is the quote from the EU.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.400]   "It takes issue only with the access to NFC input
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.080]   by third party developers of mobile wallets
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.720]   for payments in stores, I get it.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.280]   So when I go into the store and pay, I have to use Apple Pay.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.320]   I can use it on Square, but I have to use Apple Pay to pay."
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.240]   So, and they say 8,500 banks,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.400]   but maybe that's as it is in the US,
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.160]   through Apple Pay, because my bank--
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.040]   - It's 2500, I think it's 2500 banks.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.600]   - It's still, yeah, I don't think that many banks--
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.920]   - All of the banks in the world.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.520]   - We only have five banks in Canada,
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.240]   but you guys have five banks per se.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.080]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.240]   - But that's still through Apple Pay.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.440]   So what Square or PayPal would like is for you--
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.480]   I can see that's a little more complicated,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.040]   so that when you do the tap to pay,
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.520]   so I just double-press my watch and Apple Pay pops up.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.200]   Although I could do a different credit card.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.160]   - Yes, but they want you to launch the Square app
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.160]   and then have a little tap to pay thing pop up into it.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.000]   - Oh, forget it.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.400]   Okay, if that's what they're talking about,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.880]   that's not, just have a PayPal credit card, which they do.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.040]   - Then I can slide over to the PayPal credit card, that's all.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.880]   - Everyone wants to own the experience and the data.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.240]   See, like Apple also has incredible privacy rules around--
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.400]   One of the things that rankles them
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.080]   is that Apple has incredible privacy rules,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.320]   hides all the transaction data,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.160]   they get almost nothing from the purchase,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.680]   and that's all incredibly valuable to them.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.920]   So I misunderstood this.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.480]   I'm actually, I'm not gonna come down
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.800]   and complete another side of this.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.760]   I mean, when you have a Google phone
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.000]   and you activate Google Pay,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.240]   you can't activate somebody else's pay, including Apple Pay.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.720]   - Well, they want you to, yeah, they want to force you
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.960]   to open their app and then do it.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.040]   But the thing is that Apple may not,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.680]   Apple may give them access to the NFC,
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.520]   and they can open their app,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.880]   but that doesn't mean that when I roll up to it,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.480]   that'll be the next thing that they ask for,
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.120]   is that, hey, we want equal access.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.320]   This is where these big companies,
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.120]   and remember, this is a rich person's game.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.000]   These are all big companies that are all making up the money.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.600]   - It's only on the credit card that they're talking about here.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.960]   - They are a billion dollar companies
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.080]   wanting to make more billions off of Apple's back.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.320]   They're not the little guy, you know,
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.840]   trying to get ahead.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.600]   And they're doing all of these requests
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.520]   at the cost of the user experience.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.480]   - That's right.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.320]   - So everything that they, all these things,
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.000]   whether it's Epic or PayPal or everything,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.560]   all of them want to do something that is not good for the user,
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.400]   because they don't care about us.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.600]   Apple only, and I'm not saying that Apple cares about us,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.840]   but Apple's business model is to make it simple for us
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.800]   and to make it easy for us to use.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.920]   That's their business model.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.880]   That's how they make profit.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.800]   So they, and I prefer that business model,
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.480]   as opposed to using up all of our data,
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.080]   making it complicated for us to use, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.440]   - So the tool, the tool, PayPal's probably going for is Venmo.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.120]   So right now, if I wanted to pay with Venmo,
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.680]   I'd either need a Venmo credit card attached to my Apple wallet.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.320]   - I can't. - And essentially.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.640]   - Yeah. - There's no way to--
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.120]   - You can't tap to pay with anybody else's--
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.240]   - I can't tap to pay with Venmo.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.800]   - Right. - I could do it with a credit card,
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.640]   but not with another wallet.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.840]   So I see where the problem is.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.240]   By the way, PayPal owns Venmo.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.360]   So it's probably, I'm imagining it's Venmo
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.720]   that they're actually more worried about than anything else.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.240]   Or, you know, for Square, the Cash app, the Cash.me app.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.840]   - Or like Google Wallet and Microsoft Wallet,
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   everyone wants their wallet. - Or Google Wallet.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.960]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.320]   - And again, I think that timing is important to them
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.600]   because if Apple's able to hold out
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.200]   for let's say another year or two, they will,
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.520]   I mean, right now there's still a lot of banks in Europe
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.200]   that don't support Apple Pay.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.560]   But once that finishes and people get used to it
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.120]   and they get into a pattern, it's going to be problematic for them.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.160]   - Yeah, Apple owns the wallet. - Yeah.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.000]   But Samsung owns the wallet on a Samsung phone.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.720]   And although Samsung will let you use Google Pay, I think.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.000]   - I think on Android they can use the NFC, you know, chip.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.320]   - All right, so now that I understand exactly
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.280]   what they're complaining about, I'm a little less...
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.960]   - But you're open access versus your data privacy,
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960]   you always fight with each other, right?
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.360]   - Yeah. - Like there's like a different...
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.000]   - Again, iPhone, I think you're right, Alex.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.360]   The consumer just says, "I'm using the iPhone.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.000]   It's the Apple Wallet. That's what I'm using."
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.680]   - And again, we bought into this.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.600]   Like, you don't see a lot of consumers complaining about this
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.160]   or wishing it was some other way.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.360]   You know, these are a bunch of other kings.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.720]   They're kings of England that want part of France.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   - Right. - You know, like this is...
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.040]   - It's not for us. - All of these companies.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.720]   All of these companies having all these complaints,
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.440]   whether it's Spotify or all these...
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.240]   They're the King of England
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.160]   and they would like to have part of France.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.160]   - Yeah. - Like King of the...
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.000]   - Because of the interview. - Because of the interview.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.760]   - The King of the philosophical debate still.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.720]   Like, 'cause some people truly believe that choice means
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.800]   having a choice of everything on every platform.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.440]   And other people believe that choice means having a choice
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.400]   of platforms.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.880]   And some people really just want Apple and they like the idea
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   that there can nothing ever can happen on it.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.640]   And if they want something else, they'll go to Android.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.440]   And other people will like, "No, but I like Apple hardware.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.240]   "So please give me the Android experience on Apple."
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.080]   And that's a huge argument.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.200]   - The issue is that we will...
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.560]   If you increase the choice the way people are asking for it,
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.280]   the user will lose choice.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.040]   You know, Disney and Netflix and other folks will start putting
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.240]   their apps only on outside of the App Store.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.320]   They'll only put it out there.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.040]   So we as users lose choice when that is there.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.120]   And I think that the consumer should be the primary thing
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.520]   for the governments to protect.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.400]   Not the King of England.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.920]   You know, like, you know, or the King of whatever.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.840]   Like we don't, who care?
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.320]   You know, like they have to figure out their business.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.480]   - Well, that's... - They're big kids.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.240]   - That's the big debate.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.080]   And that's how our antitrust laws changed in the Reagan era.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.440]   It became consumer focused as opposed to protecting competition.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.720]   - I think there's a good case to protect competition
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.000]   to allow other innovators to come along.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.480]   That benefits consumers in the long run.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.360]   You don't have to just, in fact, I think it's wrong
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.600]   to just look at the consumer arm.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.400]   But that's a big long debate over antitrust.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   We won't get into that for the moment.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.520]   But I think there are.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.800]   I understand that's true.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.160]   - Not without Andy. We'd be cheating on him.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.160]   - Yeah, I don't want to cheat on me.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.920]   Now, this one is for you, Renee, I think.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.280]   Researchers find flaw in Apple Silicon chips,
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.600]   but say it's not that bad.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.520]   (laughing)
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.960]   I mean, that's why a lot of that stuff
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.240]   ultimately ends up bad.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.840]   - Yeah, even let's, you know, despite the hair on fire
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.720]   of meltdown and specter with the Intel chips,
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.560]   you know, as far as I know, it was never exploited
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.400]   in the wild.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.000]   It was a very hard thing to exploit.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.080]   And in fact, a lot of the mitigations
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.520]   just slowed your machine down.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.800]   And for most people, if you're not running a server anyway,
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.520]   you don't have to worry about meltdown and specter.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.160]   These are kind of on the order of that.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.920]   There's a flaw in the data memory dependent pre-fetch.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.840]   You got to watch out.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.080]   Those pre-fetchs will get you every time.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.440]   - In a lot though.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.920]   - The MPs, which decide which memory content to pre-fetch,
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.720]   this is kind of like speculative execution.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.560]   - Yes.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.960]   - Are well known in academic circles,
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.040]   but yet to be deployed in a commercial product.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.800]   So these researchers tweeted,
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.680]   this is from David Cole Brenner,
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.680]   and he is with, as assistant professor at UWCSE,
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.280]   and he's a hardware security person.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.560]   We found a way, so I guess it's University,
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.080]   that found this, a way to leak data on Apple Silicon
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.720]   that is at rest, that is the data,
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.320]   that is data the core never reads speculatively
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.560]   or non-speculatively, okay, whatever.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.360]   Pre-fetchers.info, if you wanna realize,
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.560]   or read more about this, at a high level,
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.880]   we found that Apple processors have a DMP, which is cool.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.080]   That's not something normally, you don't normally see that.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.000]   We found this DMP pre-fetchs
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.200]   in a ray of pointers D referencing pattern.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.440]   Okay, we found that you can use this pre-fetch,
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.560]   pre-fetch your to leak data pointers
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.280]   that are never read by an instruction,
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.360]   any instruction, even speculatively.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.880]   And you ain't never gonna have to worry about this
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.400]   in your lifetime, probably.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.000]   It affects the A14M1 and M1 Macs, some old,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.640]   they believe some older A-series processors
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.560]   than the newer M1 Pro chips are also effective,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.720]   but they've only confirmed this on the M1 Macs.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.560]   How bad is this?
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.400]   Really, right now, not that bad.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.680]   We have not demonstrated any end-to-end exploits
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.720]   with augury techniques at this time.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.120]   Currently only pointers can be leaked,
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.200]   and likely only in the sandbox threat model.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.840]   If you are counting on ASLR in a sandbox, I'd be worried.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.280]   Otherwise, be worried when the next round of attacks
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.560]   using Augury come out.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.560]   That's always, by the way,
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.280]   and I've learned this from listening to Steve Gibson
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.120]   for 15 years.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.240]   The first exploit may not be dangerous,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.800]   but it's cause for concern because what happens
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.040]   is people then start working on that to do something else.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.920]   They chain them.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.840]   They chain them.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.480]   Or you find out, well, if I can get that pointer,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.400]   I might be able to use that pointer in some other way,
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.520]   and yeah, it can get worse.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.960]   So I realize this is super technical.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.440]   I think the most interesting thing--
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.040]   It's nerdy, interesting.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.480]   The thing that's interesting is that they're using a DMP,
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.440]   which we did not know,
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.480]   and I think a data memory dependent pre-fetcher,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.360]   that's a pretty cool technique.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.000]   And as with a lot of speculative execution techniques,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.880]   there's potential problems, much like Spectre and Meltdown.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.080]   And Silicon is unforgiving,
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.040]   and there's no amount of internal QA will ever be the same
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.600]   as a million people hitting your hardware,
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.760]   or you're doing a bunch of research engineers.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.320]   So hopefully they'll learn from this,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.920]   and it's always going to happen though.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.280]   There's always going to be a group of people
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.600]   who find interesting things.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.840]   Some of them become bad for us,
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.240]   some of them become learning instruments for the vendor,
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.280]   and they make improvements over time.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.760]   I just find it fascinating from a Silicon point of view.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.440]   The team actually is UW,
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.040]   which I guess is University of Wisconsin,
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.120]   U-I-U-C, and Tel Aviv University.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.160]   They didn't provide their,
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.040]   they just give you the acronyms.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.280]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.240]   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is U-I-U-C.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.440]   That's of course where the Netscape browser came out of.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.960]   UW is University of Washington.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.680]   Okay, sorry about that.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.560]   CS.Washington.edu.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.160]   And I love it, a little credit to a non-tech.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.040]   The researcher said we began looking at the M1 and A14
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.320]   after reading this a non-tech article,
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.200]   including the quote, "In our microtextual..."
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   (laughs)
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.720]   Yeah, I gotta do this in a more nerdy voice.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.600]   "Little our micro-architectural investigations.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.320]   We've seeds of signs of memory magic on Apple's designs,
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.880]   by the height of the flavin,
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.400]   well we might believe they're using
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.000]   some sort of point of chase prefetching mechanism.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And being big brains at UW and UI-U-C and Tel Aviv,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   they said, "Wow, maybe we could use this."
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.920]   The only bad thing is that,
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.920]   I and Antech are so smart,
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.280]   almost every single one of them has gone to work
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.600]   for a vendor now.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.160]   They're almost nobody left.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.400]   Getting Ryan is the only one.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.440]   No, almost none of them were at Intel, almost no weird Apple.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.280]   Apple?
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.040]   Okay, okay, Quelka.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.640]   As far as we know, Apple is not patching anything.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.360]   We've discussed this with you with Apple
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.200]   and they're aware of all details.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   I'm gonna guess that just as with Spectre and Meltdown,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.960]   a patch is gonna remove something
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.160]   that really speeds up the chip.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.040]   And unless you see it as a real threat,
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.460]   you're probably not gonna want a patch.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.280]   Or at least patch.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.560]   Yeah, keep your eyes on it.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.400]   Carefully.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.000]   We'll keep our eyes on it.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.840]   Let's take a break.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.360]   You have a new book, I wanna ask you all about it,
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.880]   by Tripp Meckel of the New York Times.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.840]   It's not my book, yes.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.680]   It's Tripp's book.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.440]   But you've read it.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.520]   Yes, couple of times.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.840]   We've only been able to read excerpts from it,
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.080]   but the excerpts are fascinating.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.840]   We're gonna try to get Tripp in for a special here
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.360]   to do a triangulation.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.240]   And if you wanna join me since you've read the book,
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.040]   I would encourage you to do so.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.880]   Of course.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.560]   We'll let you know when that is gonna be.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.000]   But let's take a little break and come back
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.720]   'cause you've read the book and there is quite a bit in there,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.040]   including some interesting stuff about Johnny Ive
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.960]   and why he left.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.000]   But first a word, oh, look at that.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.080]   You left the transition in just for me.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.280]   That was Augury.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.640]   Now that's Augury.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.520]   First a word from Zip Recruiter.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.720]   If somebody great has left your company,
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.400]   somebody like Johnny Ive,
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.120]   and you need to replace them,
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.400]   you need Zip Recruiter.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.280]   Some people just make life so much easier.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.120]   You don't know what you do without them.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.800]   Your chief designer, maybe your partner, your friend,
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.200]   your personal assistant.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.120]   If you need to grow your business,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.120]   Zip Recruiter makes hiring so much easier
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.600]   because they do the work for you.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   And now you can try it free at ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.560]   Why is Zip Recruiter so great?
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.440]   Well, first of all, you're gonna post that posting
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.800]   on Zip Recruiter, it goes out to 100 plus job boards
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.640]   and social networks, so you cast the widest net.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.240]   Their tools make it really easy for you.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.520]   Applications don't come into your inbox.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.120]   They don't call your phone.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.160]   They all go into the Zip Recruiter interface,
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.680]   which makes it very easy, the reformat resumes, for instance,
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.880]   to scan through all the possible hires.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.320]   You can even have questions to screen out,
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.180]   people who just don't qualify.
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.180]   Yes, no true false essay.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.920]   And it makes it easy to hire the right person fast.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.360]   But there's another thing Zip Recruiter does,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.240]   that's so cool.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.760]   They actually find candidates for your job.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.960]   They work on your behalf.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.760]   By going through all the resumes they have
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.120]   and saying these people have the qualifications,
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.360]   take a look at those people,
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.400]   invite your top choices to apply.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.960]   And I can tell you from experience,
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.480]   when you invite somebody to apply for a job,
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.360]   when you send them a note, say,
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.920]   "Hey, you know what, you'd be great for this job.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.880]   Are you interested?"
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.040]   They're much more likely to apply,
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.320]   much more likely to follow through,
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.640]   much more likely to take the job.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.400]   So this really works.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.000]   No wonder four out of five employers
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.400]   who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.720]   Within the first day,
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.320]   in our experience, it's often within the first hour.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   Zip Recruiter is now rated the number one hiring site,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.640]   based on G2 ratings as of January 1st of this year.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.220]   Congratulations, Zip Recruiter.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.720]   The hardest thing you'll face today is not hiring.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.920]   It's just remembering that special URL,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.560]   ziprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   Try it for free, ziprecruiter.com/macbrek.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:23.720]   It's the smartest way to hire.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.320]   And it works for us, we've used it many times.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.240]   Thank you, Zip Recruiter.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.280]   And by the way, Tim, if you're looking for a new design lead,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.760]   (Tim laughs)
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.760]   Zip Recruiter.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.960]   All right, so the book, "Trip Mickle,"
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.160]   writes for the New York Times.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.600]   He's written for many different places,
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.800]   as I remember, right?
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.040]   Yeah, he was a Wall Street Journal for a long time.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.240]   Journal, a long time journal guy.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.200]   And he covers Apple.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.120]   He covers Google.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.440]   He was the long time journal reporter on Apple,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.320]   before the alcohol in tobacco.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.640]   Yes, yes.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.040]   Good reporter.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.360]   He has a new book, show us the book, what's it called?
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.560]   "Aster Steve."
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.840]   How Apple, what was it?
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.760]   How Apple became a trillion dollar company,
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.880]   but lost its soul.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.720]   Oh.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.160]   That's like the YouTube title, though.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.480]   I mean, that's really like the YouTube title.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.760]   Yeah, that gives you, yeah, that gives you
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.400]   some idea of where they're going in there.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.680]   All I've read is the excerpt that Times published,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.720]   why Johnny I've left Apple.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.040]   Yes.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.000]   Tell us about that.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.640]   He was not happy, it turns out.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.480]   It wasn't a--
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.640]   So mutually immaculate.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.440]   I have to preface this by saying that,
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.840]   the issue I have with a lot of mainstream publications,
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.680]   when it comes to Apple, is exactly like,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   this is why it was trepidation,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.680]   as the trip was writing it.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.920]   He's an fabulous reporter, excellent writer,
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.400]   excellent, excellent writer.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.880]   But the journal will do something like,
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.800]   take a tobacco reporter, throw them on the Apple beat
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.040]   and say, go cover them.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.280]   And Apple's like, it's like the same problem with Lego
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.080]   and Ikea, they're just not normal companies,
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.320]   and they end up getting covered by the journal
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.800]   and by a bunch of other publications like their IBM.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.840]   You know, like, there's no understanding of Apple there,
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.240]   so the narrative is always wrong.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.640]   It's like, the facts are correct,
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.600]   and this is how IBM would act under that situation,
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.760]   but it's not at all the way Apple did that.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.680]   That's interesting premise, though.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.440]   Do you really think Apple is that different from any other company?
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.280]   Yes.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.280]   How?
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.240]   I think the way that they were structured from Steve
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.840]   and the way that Tim has continued to implement things
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.280]   is they don't make the same kinds of decisions
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.400]   for the same kinds of reasons.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.360]   They're also much more, like, they're very,
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.400]   I know this sounds ridiculous,
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.040]   but they're very see what you see is what you get.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.280]   Like, Tim is very, very Tim.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.400]   And a lot of companies aren't, they're very bureaucratic
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.960]   and they're very hidden and they have
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.400]   like all these different shareholder things that they're like,
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.240]   you don't want to--
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.920]   CEOs because they have--
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.440]   Yes.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.320]   Talking points and they never deviate
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.400]   and they're really not honest, really, frankly.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.960]   And Apple makes-- Apple thinks long term.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.000]   Like, a lot of companies also, especially in our generation,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.320]   are very immediately focused, where Apple does have a history
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.120]   of doing a lot of very long game things,
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.000]   like things that don't make sense in the short term,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.960]   but really do pay off.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.440]   Like, there's a lot of ways they could extract a lot more money,
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:56.840]   right?
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.720]   They could put T-shirts up on apple.com.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.600]   They sell billions of dollars worth of T-shirts on apple.com,
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.720]   but they just don't do it.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.000]   And that's very different than the way
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.320]   a lot of other businesses are like IKEA and like Lego.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.680]   I mean, they're just-- they're outlier businesses.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.480]   OK.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.080]   So do you feel like Tripp does not understand that?
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.960]   I think-- and he's reporting, I always felt that.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.680]   Like, he always had a good amount of facts,
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.560]   but I didn't think he came to the right conclusion.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.040]   I don't think that we can get into whether there are narratives
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.900]   at the Wall Street Journal and the Times editors
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.400]   impose on this stuff.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.600]   That's probably an element of it.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.840]   But I think he did get a really good understanding of Apple.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.920]   Maybe not all the people involved.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.880]   But I think he comes off understanding Apple way better
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   in this book.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.280]   And I think it's much to his credit
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.120]   that all these interviews gave him all that insight.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.880]   Some of the stories he tells, I know some of the people involved.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.760]   And they didn't happen exactly the way
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.160]   that they happened in the book.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.600]   So I think the people who were inclined to talk to him
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.120]   are the people who weren't that happy with Tim Cook or Johnny
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.760]   I.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.400]   And that might explain why some of the--
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.880]   why it's like, yeah, this happened,
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.360]   but that's not the vibe at all that happened.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.160]   It's like, because like, you know, like any business,
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.160]   you've got to make choices.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.280]   You've got to make compromises.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.440]   You've got to make trade-offs.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.240]   And the people who don't get their way are generally upset.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.440]   And I get a lot of the vibe from like, the upset people
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.480]   got to talk a lot for this book.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.400]   He says, 200 interviews with current and former Apple
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   employees and advisors.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.760]   A compendious review of public sources.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.000]   Neither I've nor Cook agreed to speak to the author for attribution.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.800]   That's interesting for attribution.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.840]   But the story that's told in the excerpt in the Times
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.840]   is that Johnny I was increasingly unhappy after Steve
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.600]   died with the bureaucratic nature.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.200]   He said the accountants are running the show
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.800]   and became more and more disengaged to the point where,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.920]   at one point, all of the designers
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.120]   were gathered together to show him new designs for the iPhone.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.240]   He arrived three hours late without apology, looked at them,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.360]   made some notes, and then wandered off,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.000]   and never made any choices.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.840]   That's a battery.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.040]   Yeah, the whole overall motif of the book
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.080]   is that Tim Cook was like an absentee father for Johnny,
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.480]   where Steve was always there for him, always visiting him,
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.480]   always editing things, giving feedback.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.320]   And Tim did not want to be Steve.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.280]   He knew he couldn't be Steve.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.760]   And so left Johnny almost entirely alone,
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.360]   which is what he did with most of the executives.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.200]   He trusted them to run their business.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.760]   And Johnny didn't have anybody like Steve to work with
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.440]   after having somebody like that.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.320]   And at the same time, Tim didn't have Steve.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.040]   So in their attempts to scale the company,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.840]   Johnny, I guess, feels sort of quasi-abandoned.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.040]   And Tim feels like, OK, you want to make a goal.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.720]   Johnny's excesses weren't curtailed.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.440]   So all Tim sees is gold watches, massive tents,
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.360]   cars that have living rooms and no steering wheels.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.840]   And he feels like some order needs to be imposed on this.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.360]   And then Johnny feels like he's not
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.160]   being protected and nurtured the way he was under Steve.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.200]   Even though Steve was very good at pruning him,
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.680]   so you have just like--
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.960]   there was a missing ingredient.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.720]   How could there not be, because Steve was gone?
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.120]   I think Johnny wasn't 100% successful either.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.480]   I mean, by the way, I totally agree with the living room
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.280]   without a steering wheel.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.480]   I think that is the future.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.240]   But just put on the record.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.120]   But you wanted to check that in 2019, Alex.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:08.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.080]   I would have bought one in 2019.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:15.960]   Anyway, so what I would say is the keys on the laptop
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.120]   didn't turn out too well.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.720]   There was a whole bunch of things that
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.400]   were becoming form over function, all the way down
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.200]   to there's rumors that they had to put dots on the glass.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.400]   Because the rumor was those were Johnny Ives tears.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.320]   So people kept hitting into the glass
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.880]   and they kept on running into the glass.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.040]   You're talking about the curved windows at the Apple campus.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.640]   All the doors in between the doors.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.560]   The doors, people just walk into them all the time.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.080]   And so they had to put little dots across them to cover them
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   up.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.640]   Because you wanted a completely clear glass.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.560]   And so the thing is, is that I think
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   that those are the--
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.160]   I think he wasn't knocking it out of the park.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.120]   I mean, there was definitely things
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.640]   that were having how it looks become more important
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.400]   than how it actually operates.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.800]   And a lot of us were getting upset.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.000]   I mean, I stopped buying the laptops.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.680]   And I'm a pretty ardent Apple user.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.040]   And for me to say, I'm going to stick with my 2016 laptop
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.760]   is a thing.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.560]   That's not covered in the book, which I thought
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.400]   was a big surprise.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.360]   They don't cover the Mac, the keyboard, any of that.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.480]   The watch has covered a lot.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.680]   Some of the other stuff.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.480]   The car is not the--
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.600]   Is this really a book about Johnny Ive?
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.920]   It sounds like more than Apple?
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.600]   It alternates.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.400]   So it's almost like, you know how Game of Thrones
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.360]   had a point of view characters?
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.320]   You have the Tim Cook point of view chapters.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.120]   And then the Johnny Ive point of view chapters.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.520]   And some chapters crossing between like a Star Wars movie
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.520]   finale when you're going from group to group.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.280]   Seeing how the different people are reacting.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.840]   Clay Shurky reviews it for the New York Times
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.200]   and says, in the Apple log, Michael
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.560]   drops his reporter's detachment to a portion
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.880]   of responsibility for the firm's failure
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.120]   to launch another transformative product.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.640]   Cook is blamed for being aloof and unknowable, a bad partner
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.040]   for Ive, quote, "an artist who wanted to bring empathy
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.640]   to every product," end quote.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.040]   Ive is also dinged for taking on quote,
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.280]   responsibility for software design and the management burdens
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.920]   that he soon came to disdain end quote.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   By the end, the sense that the two missed a chance
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.760]   to create a worthy successor to the iPhone is palpable.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.880]   And Shurky says, it's also who we.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.760]   And the best evidence of this is the previous 400 pages.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.120]   It's true that after Jobs died, Apple didn't produce
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.520]   another device as important as the iPhone,
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.440]   but Apple didn't produce another device that important
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.840]   before he died either.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.280]   So--
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.160]   And nobody else has.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.120]   And nobody else has.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.120]   The iPhone is such an outlier that any time you compare
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.280]   anything to the iPhone, you're going to lose.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.280]   And I do think that--
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.920]   Apple launch an AirPods business is big.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.880]   Sorry, I left.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.480]   No, and I agree.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.160]   And I think that I do think that eventually, someday
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.880]   in the future, we'll probably have an Apple car.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:54.320]   And then you have the glasses are going to be,
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.240]   whatever that turns out to be.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.920]   And those will be slow cookers like the way we see the watch.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.760]   I don't think they're going to be
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.960]   a replacement for the iPhone.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.880]   But I think that we're going to start seeing that pie chart,
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.200]   where the iPhone is half, continue to decrease.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.600]   And that may not be revolutionary,
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.640]   but it is super powerful as a company
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.080]   to be able to keep on maintaining your revenue
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.000]   and then continuing to diversify it
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.920]   into very different markets is something
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.360]   that very few companies do well.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.920]   And maybe Apple won't do it well either.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.440]   But I think that we're on a trajectory of three to five
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.560]   years from now, nothing being more than 30% of the revenue.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.160]   And that puts them in a much different place,
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.360]   especially when you start talking about antitrust.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.080]   And you talk about other things that are like, well,
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.920]   we might lose a little bit of something on the iPhone,
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.120]   but we've got all these other things
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.480]   that are doing well.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.280]   So I think it's what I will say is that Cook has brought,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.920]   I think he has taken some of the excitement out of it,
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.920]   but he's brought a level of management
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.480]   that is why Apple keeps growing.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.320]   You know, like it's--
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.360]   - It's not under Disney.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.840]   - I think it felt to me, and again,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.400]   I haven't read the book, I look forward to it.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.120]   It felt to me that I was singularly happy under Steve Jobs
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.880]   and didn't like Tim Cook's style.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.720]   Well, that happens all the time.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.280]   They're very different stylistically.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.240]   - Tim Cook has missed Steve enormously.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.080]   - Yeah.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.440]   - But Tim has made Apple even more successful, to be honest.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.280]   - So--
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   - Like Steve was so decisive, and he was normally,
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.480]   he'd make big blunders too.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.200]   Like, and Johnny said that he had like big dopey ideas sometimes,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.320]   but he was really good at like,
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.120]   you present him something, he'd say use that one.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.360]   And he was mostly right.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.920]   And Johnny couldn't do that on his own.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.360]   And Tim was like waiting for people to do that on their own.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.960]   And that led to a lot of tension.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.280]   He does cover Apple's rise to services though,
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.640]   especially how Tim Cook managed to get Wall Street
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.360]   off his back by going all in on services.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.200]   Now that ramped up the price-turning ratio considerably
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.400]   because Wall Street appreciates services business.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.240]   And to Alex's point, that's now such a huge contributor
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.760]   towards Apple's bottom line.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.360]   - Well, and also the fact that,
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.800]   I don't think Steve ever,
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   I don't think they never did a dividend.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.440]   You know, any kind of stock buyback or anything.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.280]   Steve, we really felt like you were lucky to be on the train
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.120]   with him.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.200]   Like, you know, like you could--
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.040]   - Scott, you said for--
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.880]   - You're not gonna get chapped.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.360]   - Charity for Lancer P, any of that he didn't believe.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.560]   All that stuff was, yeah.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.360]   So he just believed his job was to do that.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.160]   - It looks to me like, and again, I haven't read the book,
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.440]   so you correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.400]   that there's a lot of great information in this book
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.080]   that where Michael might have gone wrong
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.480]   is trying to build a narrative around what is essentially
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.440]   kind of a random walk with different people
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.640]   bouncing off of each other.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.520]   And you know, why hasn't Apple had another iPhone?
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.440]   Well, you know, I mean, it's hard to say this is why.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.160]   So he's just a little too dimensional.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.240]   - He's trying to make a narrative out of it.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.760]   That doesn't really fit the facts, just--
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.440]   - It's just a bit 2D.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.280]   - Yeah, it's 2D.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.880]   I mean, the stories are really good, but it's very--
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.720]   Yeah, it's too--
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.920]   Well, it depends on how much you know Apple.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.440]   If you don't know Apple at all, it'd be like,
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.840]   "Oh my God, I can't believe all this is happening.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.680]   "It's such drama.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.680]   "This would be a soap opera."
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.120]   Like, this is what was going on,
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.400]   but when you know Apple's like, "Ah, yes."
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.120]   But, you know, if you had to do all that stuff,
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.560]   that was really hard to do.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.120]   - We had the same complaints about Isaac's in his books,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.880]   that about his biography of Steve Jobs,
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.200]   that it was fine if you were not, you know,
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.880]   as we are, you know, buried in Apple trivia.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.680]   But the people who really had been following this all along
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.080]   felt like it was a little bit of an outsider's perspective.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.080]   - There's a great story, like there's one great story
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.040]   where he's like so angry.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.200]   Johnny I was so angry that he makes these beautiful
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.680]   super ellipses where the curves are so gradual
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.720]   and Scott Forest all keeps planting
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.400]   these ridiculous round wrecks
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.320]   with just like curved corners on the phone
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.720]   and they don't match and it makes him crazier and crazier
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.080]   and finally he gets rid of Scott and takes over it.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.360]   But then he's like, "I didn't want to take over.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.120]   "I just wanted to fix those right down.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.560]   "I just wanted to go in there and say do this,
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.120]   "but I didn't want to have to manage them all."
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.480]   - It's pretty clear that Tim or us,
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   Johnny did not really relish this role
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.280]   that he was put into of managing all of the power,
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.640]   but not the management.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.840]   - What the power, but not the job.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.120]   - And to get back, I mean, this is the challenge
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.760]   with any book that's written is that
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.600]   if you're writing from the outside,
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.480]   and this is every piece of press that we watch,
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.520]   every, you know, when you're dealing with people who are,
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.840]   this is one story for this week
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.800]   and another story for next week.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.760]   They're inherently going to be inaccurate
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.840]   and inherently miss the thread
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.040]   because they don't know it that well.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.720]   They don't, you know, and that's, you know,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.360]   anytime someone reports about anything
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.720]   that I'm working on, people report,
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.240]   I quietly work on a lot of things
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.200]   and people report on a lot of things that I work on
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.960]   and it's, I find it humorous to watch their version
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.360]   of what I worked on because it's not.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.200]   - It's always true.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.520]   - It's always true.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.000]   - When you read the story in the newspaper,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.880]   when you read a story in the newspaper
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.840]   about something you intimately know, it never,
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.920]   it just like, wow.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.880]   - It's not amnesia, right?
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.920]   I forget what it's called, something mall in amnesia
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.520]   where you read the article that you know
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.560]   and then you think it's all wrong
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.400]   and you read an article with something you don't know,
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.560]   you just assume it's all right.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.400]   - Right.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.240]   - Exactly. - Exactly.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.080]   - Right.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:47.920]   Well, that's life.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.680]   I mean, you know, trip, I don't know anything
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.520]   about trips job either.
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.440]   - Right. - Right.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.920]   - Exactly.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.520]   So that's just, that's the way it is.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.840]   We all are trying to see the world.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.080]   We see it through our point of view,
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.880]   we're trying to see it through others' point of view as always.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.440]   - Gell man, amnesia, that's the--
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.960]   - Gell man, amnesia, right?
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.200]   - I'm a great gell man.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.800]   - All right, so it's worth reading though,
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.720]   it's a good book.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.320]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.160]   - I think it's fun. - Again, it's not perfect,
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.000]   but like a lot of stuff you would just never know otherwise.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.840]   - Right.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.800]   It's fun for us, Apple Watchers,
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.240]   'cause we've been watching these events unfold in real time
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.040]   to see a roll up with details that we didn't know about
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.720]   and yeah, that's always fun.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.320]   I read every book I can about Apple.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.720]   So tell me some other things
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.520]   that have not been published in the New York Times
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.360]   that you learned.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.440]   - One thing that was really interesting
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.040]   is they talk about like they're working on the Apple,
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.720]   watch Johnny has this idea, he wants it to be fashion based,
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.280]   nobody else wants it to be fashion based,
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.440]   but Tim was like deferring to Johnny.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.960]   And the people they bring in to run it's like,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.280]   it's not ready yet, but they feel it's immense pressure
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.800]   because people are like, you haven't had a hit
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.840]   since Steve Jobs, you're not like a worthy successor,
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.240]   so they get it all ready to go out
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.000]   and then it's out and they don't know what it does yet.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.880]   It has like eight different functions
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.240]   and there's no focus on it.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.680]   And so people like you put it out too early,
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.800]   it's not good enough yet.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.600]   And then they're like, we should pivot to fitness.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.960]   And Johnny's like, no, it's fashion.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.920]   And so that whole thing is,
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.160]   and actually after Johnny left,
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.880]   Tim did pivot to fitness and it was the right thing to do.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.360]   Although thank you Johnny for interchangeable watch bands.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.720]   - Yes, yeah, him and Marcus,
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.360]   yeah that whole collaboration was amazing.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.480]   And the right, like you do,
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.880]   like it does give you a good sense of like talking to Johnny
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.040]   and the reverence that he has for objects.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.280]   Like he keeps them in these little things
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.000]   and like unpackages them and picks them up
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.600]   ever so carefully and really like,
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.160]   and he believed ideas were fragile.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.440]   Like one of his issues with Scott Forestall
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.760]   was like he'd have an idea and Scott would say,
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.120]   no because blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:40.720]   And Johnny was protected from all of that with Steve.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.920]   Steve would never let that happen.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.360]   He would, it's the only one who talked to Johnny.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.520]   And he would say maybe,
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.560]   like they had a very good way of talking to each other
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.360]   and he would calm down Steve too.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.440]   And when that was gone,
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.920]   he just felt it was a lot of negativity
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.640]   and he felt like negativity killed ideas.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.080]   It didn't give them any room to nurture or grow.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.160]   - Yeah, I mean,
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:03.120]   the solid gold Apple watch must have been a Johnny Ive idea,
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.480]   right? - Yeah, he wanted to play
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.800]   with more materials. - Yeah, and not a good idea.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.120]   - Well, was that, I thought we thought that was more
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.720]   of a Burberry kind of approach to things,
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.320]   you know, with Angela Aron's.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.040]   It felt like I didn't know.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.880]   - She came after that though, didn't she?
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.280]   - But she, I thought she was.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.240]   - No, she came after, but I know they got her,
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.800]   it was a continuation of that whole Apple
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.840]   as a fashion brand.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.800]   - Yes, Johnny wanted to make Apple into fashion.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.720]   He thought that was a lot of very lucrative for them.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.440]   - And I, as Tim completely abandoned that?
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.000]   - They still have the, like so Tim got the Nike deal
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.720]   and then Johnny got the LMS,
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.280]   I get yelled at no matter how I pronounce it,
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.920]   English, French, whatever, the LMS deal.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.320]   And that remains, so there is that fashion aspect,
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.240]   but everything else is gone.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.440]   - All the most stuff. - You say Hermes
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.320]   any way you want to say Hermes.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.160]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.640]   - I say Hermes, isn't that right?
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.960]   - Yes, but people got upset if you don't roll the R
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   if you pronounce the H.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.600]   - Hermes, Hermes, do not pronounce the H,
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.800]   it's Hermes, yes, yes.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   - All right, all right.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.040]   (laughing)
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.160]   - What else?
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.520]   Johnny, I started, his first big design
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.800]   was that beautiful Bondi Blue iMac.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.840]   - I think Trip got the story wrong though,
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.880]   'cause it sounds like, I've always heard it with Steve
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.200]   who said, we've gotta have a handle.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.720]   - And it sounds like Trip says, it was Johnny's idea.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.520]   - Yes, Steve says Johnny says, we need a handle,
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.960]   but no one's gonna use it, but they're gonna know
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.200]   that it's there and they're gonna appreciate
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.640]   the care and thoughtfulness of it.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.400]   - Yeah, so a lot of the stories, like,
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.000]   again, I spoke to people who are at a lot of these things,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.400]   and the stories are different, but you never,
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.440]   like if you ask three different people,
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.440]   maybe you'll get three different memories of it as well,
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.400]   so it's hard to say.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.600]   - Yeah.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.440]   Yeah, it's--
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.200]   - He does have these great stories about Jeff Williams
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.400]   and Tim Cook driving, like Toyota Camry's and Honda Chords
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.960]   for way longer, like years and years in there at Apple,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.640]   and Tim living in a tiny apartment
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.920]   until Steve showed up and said, you've gotta buy a house.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.320]   You're worth no money in the house.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.080]   - You're killing me, Tim.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.880]   We pay you a lot of money.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.360]   What did Johnny drive?
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.560]   - Oh, Johnny had like Aston Martin's in Bentley,
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.240]   and then he got a driver because he didn't want it.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.760]   He wanted to be able to work while he was traveling.
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.080]   He lived in San Francisco, Tim lived in Palo Alto.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.720]   - Oh, well, it's a lot closer to drive for Palo Alto
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.240]   to Cupertino, that is from San Francisco.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.080]   - Trip Michael, after Steve,
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   how Apple became a trillion dollar company
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.360]   and lost its soul.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.720]   I know, is it out?
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.920]   Officially, you have a galley, I think.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.720]   - Yes, I don't know.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.400]   - But I think it's out now.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.720]   I've seen reviews popping up, so maybe after--
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:39.880]   - I have to admit, I have to admit that the part
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.320]   and lost its soul, I kind of wrote it off.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.000]   - Yeah, me too.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.960]   That was such a clickbait-y headline.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.160]   'Cause arguably, they care so much about civil liberties
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.960]   and charity and helping people.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.800]   - It's quite the opposite.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.080]   - And they also, they care so much.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   If you know anybody at Apple,
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.840]   they care so much about their products.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.240]   Like, I mean, there's a lot of,
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.560]   I mean, even if you look at the emails,
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.360]   there's a lot of like angry emails about things not working.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.760]   Like people at Apple take it personally
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.000]   when things aren't working.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.560]   You know, it's not like a, I sent,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.900]   I sent this thing in about keynote.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.000]   I don't know anybody at the keynote team.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I sent a thing in, by the way,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.720]   the way the connect thing doesn't work.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.000]   I don't like the way it works with the thing.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:21.840]   I have an email right back,
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.680]   "Hey, can you send us a movie?"
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.520]   - No, they care.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.360]   (laughs)
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.200]   - Like, they were like, yeah.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.240]   - Like, I gotta fake the, so I think that, yeah.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.400]   - It came out today, available on hardcover,
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.440]   audiobook, and Kindle.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.580]   And yes, there is an audible version of it.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.240]   - Totally worth, absolutely worth reading.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.960]   - Will Dayfriend narrator.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.720]   - Yeah, maybe I'll get the audio version of it.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.480]   Thank you for that.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.040]   - And again, my critiques are somebody
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   who's been immersed in this.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.760]   Like, you did like this is just one of the best,
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.640]   it's one of the funnest Apple books you could ever read.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.880]   Way funner than a lot of the biography.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.440]   - Oh, you think so.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.280]   Okay.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   - It's just really well written and a lot of fun.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.400]   It's like, it's not panetic.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.240]   It's not like--
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.080]   - Yeah, I love the stories.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:04.920]   - The stories.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.760]   - That to me is always,
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.960]   when Andy Herzfeld started Folklore.org,
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.040]   I just read it back to cover to cover.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.520]   'Cause I love the stories of what happened inside.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:16.040]   And if you've been watching it as we have for decades
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.920]   from the outside, when you read what was going on
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.080]   inside at the same time, you go,
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.200]   oh, that explains that.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.880]   Yeah, yeah, I love that.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.600]   Good, so it's a strong recommendation.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.440]   Excellent.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   (sighs)
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.280]   Let's see, Apple's second quarter results.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.520]   Let's see here.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.720]   - All the money and all the warnings.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.840]   - They made a lot of money.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.680]   Didn't they?
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.520]   - And a lot of warnings.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.360]   - Yes.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.040]   - Revenue up 9% new March quarter record,
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.080]   service revenue all time high, as always.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.000]   - Yes.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.280]   - March revenue, it's kind of stunning.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.600]   This is three months.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.040]   - It's ridiculous. - 97.3 billion.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.280]   That means a billion dollars a day plus
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.240]   quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.52.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.000]   That's only a relevance to this stock.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.680]   - Paying for all that loss market.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:13.440]   $28 billion in operating cash flow.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.280]   (laughs)
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   Okay.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.840]   That's a good, that's a goodly amount of money.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.400]   - Which allowed them to return $27 billion
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   up into the investors.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.520]   Like, Apple's like,
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.600]   "Oh, we'll keep a little off the top."
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.040]   - Is that as a dividend?
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.160]   When they say return, do they mean as a dividend?
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.040]   - I think it's a mixture of buybacks.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.680]   - And buybacks.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.440]   Cash dividend, $0.23 per share.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.680]   That's an increase of 5%.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.200]   You'll be getting that on May 12th.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.240]   So save that and you can buy yourself a Mac studio.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:48.440]   And a $90 billion addition to the share repurchase program.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:53.160]   But let's break it down.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.720]   Because that's what really matters is how Mac,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.360]   how iPad, how iPhone did.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.360]   We're gonna take a little, another little break, I know.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.480]   It seems like we just took one,
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.920]   but I wanna divide this up into logical chunks.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.360]   So another little break.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.560]   And when we come back,
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.000]   Apple's results.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.040]   And what it means for us as users.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:19.080]   'Cause honestly, this is not a show for stock speculators.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.320]   This is what it means for us as users.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.320]   Of late I've been wearing,
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.380]   you know, do you always, when you go home,
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.840]   my mom taught me this.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.960]   And I asked Lisa, she said,
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.440]   "No, I never heard this.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.600]   "When I would come home from school as a kid."
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.080]   She said, "Okay, put away your nice clothes.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.840]   "Put on your play clothes.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.360]   "You know, don't mess up your school clothes.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.440]   "Put on your play clothes."
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.840]   And so my mind, when I get home,
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.920]   I still, I take off the suit,
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.640]   take off the starch white shirt,
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.880]   and I get my buck masons on.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.360]   My go-to clothes, they're comfortable, they're lovely.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.680]   And you know what, they're good looking enough.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.200]   I probably could wear them to work.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.960]   I love my buck masons.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.360]   I hope you have a favorite,
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.120]   a go-to piece of clothing, a shirt that's soft
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.720]   and comfortable and fits you.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.160]   Just wear whenever you don't have to,
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.440]   you know, care when anybody thinks you're sweat.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.520]   I have, you know, they always talk about
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.720]   the knives out sweater, the sweater.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.120]   I have the sweater from Buck Mason.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.720]   Actually Lisa bought it for me.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.600]   I just love it.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.880]   It's like a fisherman's sweater,
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.360]   but it's cotton, it's beautiful.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:29.040]   Jeans, just gorgeous stuff for men and women.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:34.000]   My go-tos are all buck masons.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.040]   In fact, when I was opening my buck masons,
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.240]   the last time we were doing this ad,
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.040]   it was on this week in Google,
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.040]   and Aunt Pruitt stole my (laughs)
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.200]   I gave it to them.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.520]   The sweatpants, they're not really sweatpants.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.360]   I don't know how to describe them.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.440]   I guess they call them sweatpants.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.000]   They're so comfy, they look great, they're warm,
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.440]   everything fits great out of the box.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.880]   There they are, right there.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:57.760]   Look at that.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.800]   And those shorts, fantastic.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.280]   Buck Mason makes all these essentials.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.320]   Jeans, shirts, jackets.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:07.320]   Stuff that you will have in your closet
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.600]   that will become your go-to.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.360]   Like, I can't wait to put these on.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.480]   It's play clothes time.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.680]   Let me put these on.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.800]   Let me get comfortable.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.640]   For exercise, for lounging around the house,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.360]   I call these my coat, my coating shorts.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.800]   I put those on and I write some coat.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.600]   The tailored look and fit of their T-shirts
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.880]   is second to none, they invented the curved M.T.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.800]   It is incredible.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.760]   In fact, GQ calls it the best T-shirt in the game.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.200]   Even after wearing them and putting them through the wash,
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.040]   they look just as good as when I first wore them.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.960]   Actually, they wash really nicely, softer and softer.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:48.000]   Once you try Buck Mason, they will become your go-tos as well.

[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.040]   This is comfort and style.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:16.080]   Buck Mason.com/macbreak.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.680]   Let me see if I can find six colors.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.960]   Some chats, some hot shots.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.360]   Some chats, some six color chats
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.160]   from Jason Snell, Total Apple revenue.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.080]   It is not one of, this is a Q2,
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.880]   so it's not their big Q1
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   where they make all the money on the iPhone.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.800]   Yeah, it's not the holiday sales.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   But if you note that their Q2 is now bigger
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.240]   than only a couple of years ago for the big guy.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.120]   It's the biggest Q2 ever.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.720]   The only bigger quarters are those big iPhone quarters.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.120]   So look back, you only go a couple quarters back
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.680]   and this one is bigger than their biggest quarter ever.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.800]   Yeah. Quite a quite a gross.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.480]   Really amazing.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.320]   It's really amazing.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.640]   Revenue by category.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.080]   I always look to see if it's gonna be less iPhone
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.320]   'cause I think that's healthy for the company.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.840]   But of course, it's still 52%.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.320]   Service is now 20% of revenue.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.360]   Wearables 9, Mac 11.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.960]   Glad to see that iPad 8.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.960]   Actually, here's the deal.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.760]   Okay, this is the, what was I looking at?
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.640]   What was the chart before?
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.880]   The total Apple revenue.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.560]   And then what's that?
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.960]   Then this is Mac revenue.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.800]   Ah.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.960]   Yeah. Look at that.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.320]   And they did say that half of the people
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.840]   who bought Max's quarter were first time buyers.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.900]   Switchers.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:45.200]   Plus the M1.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.600]   That is really good for Apple, isn't it?
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.520]   That is really good.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.120]   Holy cow.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:56.120]   Second best Mac quarter ever after only second to last quarter.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.480]   Revenue is up 15% year over year for the Mac.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:05.280]   iPad revenue though.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.520]   A little bit down.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.680]   iPad sort of had like the worst of the quarter
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.240]   because any supply constraints got shoved off
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.080]   onto iPad.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.920]   Any components that were shared between iPhone and iPad,
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.720]   for example, those went to the iPhone.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.320]   So all the brunt of the shortages
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.880]   ended up hitting the iPad.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.520]   So this down 2% year over year,
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.680]   not as bad as last quarter,
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.800]   it was down 14% year over year.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.720]   Last quarter was terrible.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:36.640]   iPhone revenue, 50 billion dollars.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.720]   50 billion.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:42.160]   Is I, that's, did they talk on the call about iPhone sales?
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.080]   Because we've seen rumors that for instance,
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.920]   people weren't buying, you know,
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.480]   that they were gonna slow down on some models
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.880]   and they're great except for the mini.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.080]   They're great except for the mini.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.080]   But yeah.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.200]   I mean, the mini, it's that thing was like,
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.960]   you know, 95% of the noise on Twitter
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.760]   is really represents 5% of the market.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.640]   And everybody on Twitter is a designer
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.200]   or like an entrepreneur or like a founder
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.400]   and they want a small phone.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.440]   But the majority of people are grabbing towards bigger phones.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.480]   So Apple tested it, it didn't perform well.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.000]   So now we're gonna get two bigger phones with the next one.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.880]   Hey, ladies and gentlemen, drum roll, please.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.680]   Andy, and I co is in the hat.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.680]   No, that's.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.520]   Oh, that's not.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.080]   No, there's a real deal.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.600]   There's the real deal.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.080]   I did a little tease there.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.680]   Hey, Andrew, are you okay?
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.400]   Oh, you're, well, I can't hear any audio,
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.960]   but other than that, I'm sure you're great.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.800]   Is that us?
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:32.520]   It's not us.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.960]   Andrew, unmute yourself.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.720]   It's nice to see the,
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.560]   the, you're not.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.400]   Such a tease.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.240]   I'll tell you.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.160]   Give me the burns again.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.040]   That was a good one.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:41.880]   Who did that?
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:46.360]   I can't tell if you're Andy or Wolverine.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.120]   Anthony did that fast.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:55.280]   Not as good looking as the real Andy Anaka.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.720]   Not one bit.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.760]   He is struggling with his audio.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.960]   Let's, Andy, just as soon as you get working, just shout.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.720]   We'll continue through the iPhone charts
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:09.720]   thanks to Jason Snell and six colors.com.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.040]   Let's see, we left off at iPhone revenue, revenue up 5%
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.400]   year over year.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.280]   Not the biggest ever.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.040]   Services.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   That's been linear all along now.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.040]   Almost $20 billion, 20% of the revenue.
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:30.540]   And according to Tripp Mickle, this was all Tim Cooks doing.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.640]   Yep.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.720]   They are better Wall Street narrative
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   and good opportunity to build upon the iPhone
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.840]   as a user base by getting, getting more money
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.880]   out of the same customers.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.360]   Because you start running out of customers
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.000]   at a certain point when you get big.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:42.840]   What do they call it?
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.880]   The revenue per user.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.600]   Yes.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.600]   Average revenue per user, Arpu.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.080]   Arpu.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.040]   That's how you bring--
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:50.880]   Sounds more important.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.080]   Because the problem I imagine, and I think Tripp Mickle
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.480]   wrote about this, they were facing as a saturation
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.320]   of the market.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.520]   You can't continue to grow at that pace
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.160]   because pretty soon everybody has an iPhone.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.960]   Well, you think that and then they keep growing.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.840]   Like the best part is they were worried about,
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.680]   you can't keep growing.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:12.120]   The iPhone keeps growing and they also are now growing
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.640]   this entire other revenue vertical.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.840]   So it's interesting.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:20.240]   So we're still working on Andy's audio.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.120]   I'm not sure what's going on.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.680]   Year over year, service revenue change up 17%,
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:28.840]   not the biggest growth, but still 17%.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.640]   But T, but T, good.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:31.480]   I wouldn't turn it down.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.560]   And no new services launched.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.000]   Like new services are watching for a while
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   which can be announced.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.280]   Apple won still King of the services.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.600]   And you know what?
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.560]   I've been slamming Apple TV.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.600]   I wasn't real happy with some of the early shows.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.120]   I know Ted Lassa was a big hit.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.120]   I watched the morning show of season two.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.840]   It was so awful.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.520]   So it just, it really disappointed me.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:55.080]   And yet there have been some really good newer things.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.640]   Slow horses on Apple TV is stunning.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.440]   They've done a really good job with the newer stuff.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.280]   And I think this is-
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.320]   - This is the one everybody but me is watched.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.800]   It's not servant, it's not crazy about servant.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.200]   - No, it's that other one that everyone's talking about.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.680]   It's not crazy for the finale just recently.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.160]   - Oh, severance.
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.000]   - Whoo!
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   - Severance, yeah, I haven't seen it yet.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.200]   - So severance is interesting because
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.600]   it's kind of about work-life balance, right?
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:26.920]   It's kind of about how work has become more and more horrible.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.320]   It's very much a political story, but it's not.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.640]   It's a thriller, but you realize at the end,
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.960]   you know, this is about life.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.120]   It's kind of like, first there was the office,
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.600]   then there was severance.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:42.040]   But it's a little hard at first because it's so
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.560]   essentially deprived.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:48.200]   They're, you know, it's a weird, you'll see,
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.560]   but it's not a great place to be because it's work.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.240]   But by the end, and I have to say the end
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.800]   at the worst possible time, it's just like-
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.320]   - Oh my God. - It's huge buzz though.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.360]   - If I were you, I would wait 'til season two
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.920]   before you watch it because you're gonna go,
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.840]   I know what, ha, ha!
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.320]   - Yeah, it's definitely a sequence of numbers
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.800]   that keep showing up as my understanding.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.840]   There's just, they suddenly find a hatch in the lost island.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.680]   - They kind of do, they find a hatch.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:15.960]   Yeah, that's a good way to put it.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.880]   I really feel like they're getting better and better.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.960]   The Tom Hanks stuff, Finch wasn't so great,
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.480]   but Greyhound was, they've done some deals now
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.120]   with some of the best directors in Hollywood.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:26.640]   - Shining Girls is getting good buzz.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.240]   - Yeah, I can't wait to watch Shining Girls.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.240]   - Yeah.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.640]   - So when it's turned out, it's turned out to be
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.520]   a better model than the Netflix, you know,
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.840]   Netflix trying to work properly.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.280]   - Yeah, surprise, surprise, surprise.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.600]   - It's like the new HP deal. - I think that,
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.760]   'cause the name about catalog,
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.320]   it's about original content.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.200]   But the thing is, Netflix can ever compete with Apple,
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.480]   'cause Apple doesn't need to make money on Apple TV Plus.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.320]   - Yep.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.160]   - Same as Spotify.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.720]   - Yeah, I think that the other thing is,
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.120]   is that I was really trying to analyze it
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.080]   'cause I dropped Netflix and I was trying to figure out
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.000]   why, like why it didn't matter.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.120]   And what happened was, I lost Netflix for three months
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.360]   and I didn't notice.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.200]   Like, that's what happened.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.600]   It just, I changed my credit card number
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.480]   and I had realized that it's been three months.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.280]   When I look back, I was like, I haven't paid since
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.960]   like January or whatever.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.080]   And I hadn't been watching anything.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.560]   You know, and I realized that for me,
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.720]   part of it was, is that it's so hard to keep up
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.560]   with these things.
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.840]   So the things that were keeping me coming back to Netflix
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.320]   were like, Chef's table.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.840]   You know, so I was waiting for the next season for that.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:18.760]   I was waiting for the next season
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.400]   of a couple of the documentary things.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.320]   There were definitely things that I was really into.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.000]   It's just that they didn't maintain them.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.680]   Like, they just left them go.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.040]   And I guess they decided there wasn't enough.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:27.880]   - They were yours. - But the problem is,
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.280]   then I was like, well, I'm not watching anything.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.000]   - Those have too much stuff, you know.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.200]   - Right. - So Apple TV.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.000]   - I find it. - It was a slow start.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.560]   But of course it's in his service.
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.480]   It takes them a while to find their voice.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.040]   And it's getting really good.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.240]   - The other thing is, everybody does this.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:43.360]   They're playing with the shelves.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.040]   Like how do we set, they're constantly changing our shelves.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.840]   For Netflix, I'm like, the number one thing
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.280]   I watch on Netflix is stand-ups.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.320]   So why don't you keep a shelf there all the time?
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.160]   - They should know. - But I would come in.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.640]   And if the shelf would be gone, and now I'm like,
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.360]   okay, now where do I find another?
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.520]   You know, like where do I find this?
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.360]   I don't know anymore.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.880]   I don't know how to find stand-ups, you know.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.320]   And you must keep changing and go.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:04.160]   - And the arch keeps changing.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.000]   - And you think it's new and it's not.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.160]   - And here's the thing, and the thumbnail keeps changing.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.520]   And they change the thumbnails and you pop up
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.080]   and you're like, oh, that's just what I already saw.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.040]   You know, and it just gets really frustrating.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.520]   I find like changing thumbnails really drives me absolutely.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:20.320]   - I agree that Netflix's biggest problem is bad software.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.960]   You know, because they can do so much better.
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   And you know, I have so much crap.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.120]   There's so much stuff in there.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.920]   They need to do a better job with their software.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.720]   - And they have like a whole shelf for like new releases.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.400]   And all of them are like a year or a month.
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.240]   - I know.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.160]   - Which falls advertising to me.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.040]   - I know, all right.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:40.400]   Let's see, wearables, home accessories, home, sorry,
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:45.000]   wearables and home and accessories up 8.8, no, I'm sorry.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.560]   Revenue is 8.8 billion.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.400]   The revenue change.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.960]   - A lot of the purchases were first time.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.360]   Apple watch purchases again as well.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.200]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.040]   - Still continuing.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.720]   - Yeah, I didn't read the transcript for the call
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.760]   and it wasn't on the call.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.640]   So if you have any color to add.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:58.480]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.480]   - For the call, please do.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.280]   Wearables, home and accessories.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.080]   So it's the home pods.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:11.400]   It's the, what are accessories?
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.600]   - It's basically Apple watch AirPods
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.040]   and then like the home pod stuff.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.880]   Like that's big.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.720]   - Okay, okay.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.560]   - Yeah.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.480]   - Oh, that's what I think.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.360]   - All right.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.720]   That's a big business for them, you know.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.560]   Total Apple.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.400]   - Yeah.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.240]   - Profit.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.800]   It's a profit deal.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.800]   25 billion.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.080]   The largest ever in a non-Q1.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.880]   - Yeah.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.680]   - 25 billion in three months.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.080]   Not bad.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.280]   That's up 9% year over year.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.680]   - So there was a lot of celebrating,
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.600]   especially with the analysts.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.640]   They were all congratulating them
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.760]   on how well they managed to manage everything
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.400]   going on for the last quarter.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.560]   The only, the biggest concern.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.600]   - Ah, it's Ande and Otko.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:57.080]   - That's a fossil frofondo.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.280]   Are you okay, Andrew?
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.640]   - I am okay.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.560]   I'm also very well rested.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.680]   - Oh, you overslept?
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.520]   - Believe it or not.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.440]   I was in New York all weekend.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.280]   - I saw your pictures.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.440]   - I got back to last night.
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.120]   And I had an alarm set like for 130
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.600]   to make sure I was up on time.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.200]   But then I forgot that my phone was making weird noises
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.160]   on the train home in the toy car.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.360]   So I turned down the volume for alarms
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.200]   and notifications to zero.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.160]   - So, I don't mind you get over sleep at the time.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.800]   We're just, I was just worried about you.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.320]   So I'm glad to know. - Thank you.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.000]   - You are fine.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.200]   You didn't really miss much.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.240]   - How many weeks we got you?
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.200]   - I think what really happened is Ande
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.200]   hypnotized himself and was unable to escape.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.520]   (laughing)
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.960]   - Actually, actually I was trying really hard
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.280]   to avoid having to talk that hour long
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.840]   hunk we talk about financials.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.280]   But, you missed it.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.120]   - Yeah, unfortunately.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.040]   - Timing wasn't perfect.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.240]   No, Ande was at the Met Gala.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.520]   He was wearing his Iron Man suit at the Met Gala.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.440]   And...
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:05.440]   - I gave my designer, because the assignment was,
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.400]   the theme was the golden age.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.800]   I said, here is unlimited budget.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.000]   All I ask is that you make sure it stuffs into my usual
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.520]   backpack because screw baggage fees, right?
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.360]   - It was amazing.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.880]   Everybody thought you were Jared Leto.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   It was incredible.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.440]   - I was just a mind boggling thing.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.160]   I said, no, that's Ande Anovko.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.240]   Anyway, we're glad we got to.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.040]   - We thought we'd punk Anna and Wind Tour this year.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.280]   Really couldn't came up well.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.600]   (laughing)
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.440]   - Sorry again.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.000]   - We got very glad to be here even for just the--
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.080]   - We'll get through these financials.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.040]   Sorry, I should have started with them.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.880]   And then, we would have bet it all right.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.360]   Your timing would have been impeccable.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.520]   Regional revenue, and this is really about--
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.200]   - Oh yeah, I was just gonna add that like,
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.920]   yeah, so a lot of them were congratulating Steve,
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.000]   sorry, Tim on how well that Apple managed
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.520]   the whole management of the crisis.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.960]   But then they also had this four to eight billion dollars
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.160]   that they're worried about for the next quarter.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.680]   And that's really dominated a lot of the conversation.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.320]   Mostly because Tim's color was that,
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.720]   some of that they're gonna recapture
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.560]   because they're people who really need new things,
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.520]   and they're still gonna buy them.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.880]   They're just gonna have to wait a little bit longer.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.640]   But any impulse buys, like if people just said,
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.040]   "I want this, I'm gonna buy this now."
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.200]   Oh, it's not available that they might lose.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.120]   And that was just a little bit of a concern.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.000]   So there, is it all supply chain that they're concerned about
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.120]   that's gonna cause this legacy nodes,
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.160]   like as chip shortages on legacy nodes,
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.120]   there still seem to be okay with leading edge nodes,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.360]   although it does sound like they're prioritizing iPhone
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.400]   at the expense of iPad for a lot of this stuff.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.520]   And also the closures, like the whole Shanghai corridor
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.040]   has been closed, draconianly closed,
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.840]   and Apple is prioritized because of their ties
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.680]   with the Chinese government.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.840]   And with the local industry,
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.360]   there's so much of the local economy in those areas.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.760]   They get prioritized, but so getting parts
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.120]   from other places is really hard,
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.920]   and getting those places back up and running.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.320]   It was really hard.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.280]   Yeah, it's tough.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.120]   Let me just take a look.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:56.120]   If you were to order a MacBook Pro 14-inch today,
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.680]   I just see, you'd actually be able to get it in June,
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.160]   so that's not awful.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.000]   You'd be able to get it.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.480]   Well, there should be almost nothing by now.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.280]   Like, it's usually now it's October of last year.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.920]   Yeah, it's seven weeks out.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.920]   The 16-inch is also seven weeks out.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.360]   And that's like loss of immediate sales for Apple.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.640]   This whole thing has been--
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.120]   Let's look at the Mac Studio.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.920]   I'm curious how long the delay would be for a nice.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.920]   And there was a rumor today that they're already ramping up
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.480]   for the iPhone because they're worried
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.320]   that there won't be enough,
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.200]   just enough people available to make them physically.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.320]   Yeah, yeah, also seven.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.240]   Well, depends on which studio you get.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.200]   If you get the high end seven weeks out,
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.440]   they're actually doing pretty well on the base model.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.280]   So that's--
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.040]   Those are made to order though.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.240]   So it's one skew.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.720]   There's not the same kind of pre-built skew.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.320]   They can pop the right memory modules in and ship them.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.360]   So that's not easier, but it's a much lower--
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.040]   it's a small batch for Apple compared to
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.320]   mass-produced products like Mac Pro-Ride.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.640]   Regional revenue, a big jump for China.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.800]   In fact, China's the biggest chunk China's had
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.640]   of Apple's revenue ever.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.600]   Of course, America's nice steady growth there.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.440]   Europe seems to be tailing off Japan
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:17.520]   and the rest of Asia-Pacific kind of flat.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.240]   This is in billions of dollars.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.720]   So China's a big--
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.000]   You can see how important China is almost as important
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.480]   as the EU at this point.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.080]   And year over year growth, that's
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.200]   where you really see the spike.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:36.600]   Why is Apple doing so well in China, did they say?
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.040]   I don't know if they said specifically.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.240]   They just said that they were, but Chinese manufacturers
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.760]   haven't been doing well either.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.160]   I think Apple is just so well managed.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.360]   And they're an esteem.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.040]   You get face for using Apple products.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.000]   It wasn't so long ago that Apple was saying,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.640]   oh, headwinds in China and sales are going to drop.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.960]   In fact, you see these big plummets here
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:57.520]   in previous years, 2020--
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.440]   Tim is really good at managing that relationship.
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.960]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.920]   So if you ever have to ask, why does Apple give the Chinese
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.160]   government anything they ask?
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.640]   Well, to be fair, it's a negotiation.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.240]   Like Renee said, they have a lot of--
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.000]   if Apple decided, no, we're taking our ball and going home,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.120]   they say, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:18.640]   we can talk?
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.680]   It's not as good as what we would like.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.480]   But as much as I keep on that point,
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:29.320]   I do acknowledge that Apple knows that it doesn't have to do
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.160]   exactly what they want.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.600]   And oftentimes, it's a negotiation behind the scenes
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.360]   that we never see.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:39.280]   Apple's self-service repair is now available.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.360]   Is that equipment, though, Leo?
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.200]   Yeah, it's probably a little expensive.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.680]   How much do you fix it sends you?
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.000]   I fix it sends you a spatula.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.960]   Apple sends you eight industrial presses.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.640]   There's actually a section in the diaxxistal
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:57.880]   to prepare people that it will arrive in two heavy cases,
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:03.080]   measuring like 38 inches by 18 inches, weighing 18 pounds
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.360]   and 38 pounds or something.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.560]   It's like, are they asking us to repair these or manufacture
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:08.880]   them?
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.720]   What are you getting?
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.040]   You said you wanted Apple equipment.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040]   What are you getting?
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.440]   All the exact stuff that the Apple store uses, Leo.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.280]   They're not making anything new for anybody.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.400]   You're getting exactly what they use at the Genius Bar.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.200]   And how expensive is all of this?
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.040]   49 bucks to rent for two weeks, they will take it to--
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.000]   Oh, it's a rental.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:27.520]   OK.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.160]   But like Renee said, it really is all the equipment
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.440]   you would get in the Apple store.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.720]   So instead of the IFixit guide, giving you
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.240]   the very practical results of just put the guitar pick
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.560]   inside, put the suction cup on top.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.520]   It is no put this inside this heating heat bed
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.920]   to soften the glue.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.200]   Here is the device that will center something properly.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.920]   It's-- I mean, oh my goodness.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.360]   I don't know whether this--
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:57.040]   I know that practically this is because Apple wasn't really
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.240]   set up to do this.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.760]   And so they wanted to do this program,
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.640]   but this is the only way they felt they could do it
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.040]   to ensure that people would have an OK experience
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:05.920]   with the repair.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.320]   But part of me is like, OK, fine, babies.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.000]   If you want to repair, fine.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.640]   Here is-- here is.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   First of all, you'll need 240 volt outlets,
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:17.920]   so you have to unplug your washing machine and dryer
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:18.680]   to plug this equipment in.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.520]   No, that's not true.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:20.880]   Is that--
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.800]   Secondly, a man from OSHA will come in to make sure that you're
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.440]   wearing steel paint and shoes.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.280]   Actually, to Apple, I'm like--
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.440]   They are sending it--
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.000]   shipping is free.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.080]   It's $49 rental for a week.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.400]   That's a-- I think considering the cost of what
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.600]   you get money back when you send the old parts back.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.600]   I mean, there--
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.920]   I think it's a little like at Nellis Air Force Base.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.840]   They take the ground crew.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.120]   They're the incentive.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.240]   The employee of the month kind of thing
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:51.240]   gets to go up in a F-15 in the back.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.960]   And I saw one take off.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.040]   And they go to the end of the runway,
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.760]   and they just turn straight up.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.680]   I mean, it looks like a rocket goes up.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.800]   And when they get to the top, they flip it.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.480]   They spin.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.880]   They do this corkscrew.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.040]   And then they turn really hard.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.320]   And I asked, does anyone throw up?
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:07.720]   He's like, all everybody throws up,
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.560]   except for the pilot.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.440]   And he goes-- and he goes, usually,
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.640]   when you hear the pilot going, you know you're in trouble,
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.040]   because you're going to go out.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.240]   And as they start pulling the Gs,
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.560]   and he said, there's two things there.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.720]   One is that you want to make sure you
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.120]   felt like you flew in an F-15.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.280]   You don't want to feel like, well, I just want to open up.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.520]   So you're going to get that.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.840]   And the other part is the pilots are letting you know
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.080]   that why they're pilots.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.840]   They why you're gnarly right there.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:35.840]   You know, like--
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.960]   And so sending these kind of like that was like,
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.560]   so here's what the professionals use.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.360]   And we don't have a kitty version.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.120]   You're like, you know, and to be sure
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.200]   that you want to go down this path.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   There is no kitty version.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.360]   The kid wants to go to the park and you give him the car keys.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.840]   That's what it sort of feels like.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:50.840]   All right.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.560]   But nonetheless, we have to remember that.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.400]   We're used to-- like as nerds, we're kind of used to,
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.720]   hey, look, why should I pay $600 to fix this when
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.000]   I could buy the car parts from all the Express
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.640]   and do it myself for a cheap.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.640]   But there are a lot of people that are like--
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   our closest Apple Store is a three hour drive away.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.480]   And it is not practical for us to go out to the Apple Store.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.400]   Just like I can be in an Apple Store in 15 minutes.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.360]   So for this, this still is a very, very big win.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.520]   It's also great.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.400]   Like if Dan Riccio's neighbor's kid is bugging him,
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.000]   he can just like repair the screen for him.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.480]   Like he doesn't have to bother with anything.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.160]   But if you have like the kid who used to be the one who
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.240]   took apart the radio in the old days, you know,
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.480]   or took apart the record player, like this is like--
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.520]   we have an old iPhone.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.640]   Like his really interested in it.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.440]   We'll get them the stuff.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.040]   They got a chance to look at it.
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.640]   And maybe they're like, I could never do this.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.880]   But maybe the neighbor kid could.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.960]   It's fantastic.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.960]   I could see a neighbor kid.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.280]   You know, someone like a 16 year old or 17 year old
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.040]   is pretty techy or a 12 year old.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.000]   And they just let the entire community know a next door.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.840]   Hey, I have an Apple kit.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.720]   I have an Apple kit that can do repairs.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.680]   What do we got to do?
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.600]   Who's got cracks?
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.000]   You can if you want buy these.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.080]   You don't have to rent them.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.080]   I'm trying to think.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.120]   $115 for a battery press.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:58.800]   Oh, right.
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.680]   The 6.7 inch heated display.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.440]   Now, these are specific to the phone models.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.040]   You'd have to have one for each model.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.960]   This is an iPhone 12 Pro Max.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.320]   $116 for the heated display pocket.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.000]   The display press to--
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   216 bucks.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.600]   I think we should just get one of these for the studio.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.440]   It looks like you can make a cup of coffee.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.520]   See if Aunt says, oh, I like the new coffee maker.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.560]   We get croissants and we press them like waffles.
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.320]   And then we just have a lineup outside the studio.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.920]   And then the heated display removal fixture.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.000]   This is the thing that instead--
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.040]   as you said, I fix it since you a couple of bolsters
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.600]   that you put in the microwave.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.600]   This is a little bit more high tech.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.240]   Wow.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.760]   But it's only 256 bucks.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.720]   So it's not that expensive.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.680]   They're not making a huge amount of money on this.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.720]   This is good.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.920]   If you're a small-- if you're a company that
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.760]   would like to service your employees' stuff in house,
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.640]   or if you're just an enthusiast who is the person who--
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.960]   like me, I was the kid who was--
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.120]   on Easter break, I was taking home.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.800]   My mom would come pick me up from school.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.520]   I would load up 18 different computers
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.280]   and floppy drives from the computer lab.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.200]   Because I was the one who was supposed to--
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.320]   I was the one who fixed them all during break.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.840]   I mean, this is your paper money.
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.000]   This is what you're going-- your after school money being paid
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:26.520]   for.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.320]   Hey, wow, I've got the cool tools that even the professionals
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:28.640]   have.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   And look, when you rent it for $49,
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.320]   it comes in two nice Pelican cases with a pick and callix
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.080]   of go-back.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.560]   This is like your go-back, Alex.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.760]   This is-- they learned something from--
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.040]   Again, I think that there's going
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.200]   to be kids that are making money on the side,
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.080]   just fixing people's phones.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:44.960]   The only drawback is--
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.240]   There is a restriction.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.160]   You have to get the one for that particular model.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:49.640]   So if you will--
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.240]   There's two.
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.640]   You also have to put your numbers.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.040]   So when you go to a repair, you
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.040]   can read the manuals.
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.720]   I think they let you read the manuals right away,
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.400]   just to make sure that you're OK to do the repair,
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.120]   because it can be a bit intimidating.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.000]   But then you have to put the number for your phone in there
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.760]   to generate the send request.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.080]   They don't want people ordering stuff willy-nilly.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.680]   But if you get all your neighbors' codes,
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.960]   you can just put them all in.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.920]   And then the battery bundle itself is only $71.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:16.520]   And then if you return the replaced part, you get credit.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.400]   So it's $47 bucks after credit.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.520]   That's really a great deal.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.480]   Again, impressed.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.480]   I think the folks that were arguing for this were people
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.440]   who had a business to do this.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.840]   And I still think that what Apple did
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.240]   is gave them more than what they asked for, which is what they--
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:35.640]   what they wanted.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.800]   Apple's like, OK, we're going to let everybody do it.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.880]   And basically what happened is that that's
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:44.840]   flushing the system with an incredible amount of competition.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.600]   And so for the little guys that were trying to make this a business
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.480]   and were fighting for more access to the tools,
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:59.720]   the problem they had is that Apple did way more than they expected.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.160]   And now it's going to make it much harder.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.040]   If you're an authorized dealer or an authorized repair shop,
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.840]   this is not going to affect you because people will--
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.520]   there's people like me that will just go to you
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.800]   because I don't want to deal with it.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.800]   I don't want to try to do it myself.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.880]   And I want someone authorized to do it.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.680]   So that authorized is going to be that affected.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.720]   But all the little shops that were doing this
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.160]   could be profoundly affected because people
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:24.200]   will be able to compete with them at a much higher level.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.400]   Do you think they also think people are going to look at this
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.840]   and go, oh, I never mind?
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.160]   Well, no, no, I think so.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:31.720]   Absolutely.
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.600]   I mean, I think that there's going to be a lot of people
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.760]   that just say I'm just going to go to the--
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.840]   the point is is that the people who say,
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.920]   I'm just going to go to whatever are people that are probably
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.960]   going to go to an authorized repair facility.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.400]   And so the people who were going to go to the little shop
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.520]   might want to try to save more and do it themselves.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.000]   And that's why things get much more complicated now for them.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.280]   Or if you're technically really adept and you're like Alex
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.200]   and you care about privacy, you'll just do it yourself
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.440]   so nobody ever gets to touch your phone.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.640]   I just want to fix one of my older phones for fun.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.960]   Like I just-- like, I did a couple of them
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.440]   that have some-- I just used a fun thing to do.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.240]   And that's when the interesting things about this part.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.760]   Well, Apple has said that they're
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.760]   going to be expanding this primarily with Mac hardware.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.440]   But I'm interested to see how far back they
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:19.160]   decide to go in the iPhone product line.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:23.800]   Because I fix it, got to deal with Google.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.280]   It's similar to what they have with Samsung, where Google
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.360]   is now-- will now give them official parts, official guides,
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.080]   official stuff, to be the official like, oh, I wish we
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.480]   wish we had hundreds and hundreds of Google stores
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.840]   around the country to do repairs for.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.760]   But the thing is, they're offering parts for every phone
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.720]   all the way back to the Pixel 2.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.920]   It would be nice if Apple were offering that for things
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.840]   that are not like current models, like things
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.480]   that are two or three years old that are out of warranty,
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:57.400]   maybe out of the regular access to Apple stores,
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.160]   and the people who would benefit the most
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.400]   from these kind of repairs.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.160]   Speaking of Apple TV, when is-- is it this week
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.880]   that the prehistoric world show or is--
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.240]   I don't remember.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.600]   I feel like it was like May 2 through 5th or something
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.560]   like that.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.560]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.480]   Yeah, I'll be watching it.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.280]   It looks so good.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.720]   Doesn't that look good?
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:22.280]   I'm looking at it.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.000]   I don't see it.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.240]   So maybe I got the date wrong.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.200]   Maybe it's next week.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.800]   I don't even see the promo anymore.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:30.360]   All right.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.640]   Because we had talked about that as something just--
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.760]   Looks really good.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.840]   It's so much fun.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.440]   Chatroom, do you know what-- when is the--
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.160]   You know, it's David Attenborough narrates
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.680]   the prehistoric world with dinosaurs and stuff
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.240]   as if it were planet Earth.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.040]   Is this the year the Earth changed?
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.160]   No, that's something else.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.520]   That's another David Attenborough.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.840]   All right.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.760]   Let's see, rumors.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.840]   There's not a lot this week.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:06.520]   There's the Apple iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.480]   with whole punch notch.
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:10.520]   No, no, no, I'm sorry.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.000]   Whole punch lozenge.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:12.880]   May 23rd, Leo.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:13.160]   Sorry.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:13.800]   May 23rd.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.000]   Oh, May 23rd.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   Oh, shoot.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.480]   Oh, shoot.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.320]   Gotta keep waiting.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.160]   May 23rd to 27th.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.360]   For Victoria's Day, yeah.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.240]   Is that what it is?
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.080]   It's the Victoria Day.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.320]   For the 24th, it's the Victoria Day.
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.400]   OK.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.240]   The iPhone 14 front panels have leaked on YBO
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.680]   and show an aspect ratio--
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.520]   oh, I hope this isn't true--
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.520]   slightly different aspect ratio.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.760]   19 to 5 to 9, as opposed to 20 to 9.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:47.560]   Well, for the pros, because you've
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.520]   got to fit that huge honkin eye exclamation mark shape.
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:56.440]   Now, it looks like you're still a lozenge on some models.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.160]   The regular ones still have the notch--
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:01.040]   The 14 max and the 14 have a notch,
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.280]   and the pros have the hole--
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.440]   the punch lozenge.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.560]   Exclamation mark.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.600]   The exclamation mark.
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.520]   The side-- oh, no, I wish she hadn't said that.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.840]   I'm not going to be able to unsee that.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.360]   Or the eye.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.680]   I like the eye and eye phone, Leo.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.320]   It looks exactly like the eye and eye phone.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.000]   It's a little dot.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:16.400]   All right.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.280]   Anything else in these rumors?
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.440]   These won't be till September, but--
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:21.560]   I did a whole video on this.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.480]   I found it fascinating.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.680]   But there's ongoing rumors.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.640]   Now, both Guomingchi and Mark Gurman and 9 to 5,
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.200]   Mac independently have said that Apple's going
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.440]   to stick with the A15 for the regular models,
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.080]   and the A16 for the pro models.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.720]   And the only thing I'm wondering is,
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.760]   Taiwan semiconductor was so good for so long,
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.840]   but they have not managed to get their 3 nanometer project
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:41.240]   online.
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.640]   It was supposed to be the end of this year.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.600]   That's been pushed out.
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.040]   So they're doing a 4 nanometer process instead.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.360]   And that really is just a third optimization
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.320]   of the 5 nanometer process, which is already on.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.960]   So I'm wondering if Apple just can't get enough A16 chips.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.240]   And so what they're going to do is move the A15 plus down.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.560]   Because the A15 plus is one of the extra GPU and the extra RAM.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:05.480]   Move that into the base model, iPhone 14,
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.800]   because that'll give it a big year-over-year boost.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.240]   It will be equivalent to what the pros had last year.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.240]   And then use all the A16 supply for the pro models.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.600]   And that'll give them that performance boost,
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.080]   plus whatever special features they're working on.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.280]   It's kind of supply chain management at that point.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.720]   You also have-- looks like you're getting a headache,
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.600]   because you say the iPhone 14 needs USB-C.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.040]   I couldn't agree more.
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.160]   So the thing is, you could make a case.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.720]   You could make a case that so many people
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.240]   are using lightning, and then it's simpler,
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.440]   and the USB-C standards are ridiculous.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.920]   I went and bought Thunderbolt cables.
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.160]   I paid for them, because the USB cables--
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.080]   I don't know which one does which anymore.
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:46.080]   But when the minute they put ProRes rendering--
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.360]   so they made a chipset that could capture ProRes media
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.000]   engines, all of that.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.600]   They wrote a storage controller that
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.520]   could write 6 gigabytes per minute to the drive.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.160]   But they didn't give us an I/O controller that
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:57.800]   could get it off.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.120]   And I know Alex talks about, in his world,
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.080]   you're just filming and throwing them behind you.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.720]   And PAs grabbed them and go take it off.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:06.480]   But for those of you who can't afford 3 to 4 iPhones,
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.280]   you need to be able to get the stuff off.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.280]   And even a high-speed wireless-- wireless is fun.
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.280]   It's convenient.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.320]   But if anything goes wrong, you need
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.280]   to be able to plug that stuff in and pull it off
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.040]   at faster than USB-2 speeds.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.360]   So it seems like if you're really calling it Pro,
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.840]   the last thing I'll say is that the iPhone Pro used
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.560]   to be AirPods Pro, where it really just meant premium.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.440]   But now it really is Pro.
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.760]   Pro workflows Pro, and we need Pro connectors.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.080]   I would strongly prefer a USB-C on an iPhone.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.720]   I mean, having it--
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.600]   I have so many parts of my ecosystem now that are all USB-C.
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.880]   Yes, exactly.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.040]   That I would-- it's now the odd cable out.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.920]   It's the one that I have to keep on remembering to pack,
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.480]   because I have plenty of the other ones.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.080]   All of mine take power and data.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.360]   I throw the ones away that do slow data.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.200]   Just like--
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.680]   I just can't take it.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:59.240]   But outside of that, the USB-C is very flawed.
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:03.600]   And in the way that it's labeled.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.840]   Like, that's the big problem with it,
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.640]   is that there's 1,000 different ones that are all the same.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.640]   But I think that it would be really great to have the phone
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.160]   with a USB-C.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.560]   Yeah, I will add to that.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:17.000]   That I've replaced my really, really nice phone
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.360]   finally after like five years, like last year.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.360]   I was considering switching back from Android to iPhone.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:26.400]   And honestly, the thing that kind of cut that off early
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.720]   was the fact that the iPhone doesn't have USB-C.
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.320]   And the fact that in my--
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.920]   there was a lot of pluses and minuses to both of my eyes.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.520]   It's not as though like that was what decided the thing.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.280]   But the thing is like, but do I really
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.480]   want to have to make sure I have the right cable every time
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.120]   that I travel, or any time I go out to another set of cables?
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.960]   It's after spending four days in New York
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.160]   and actually taking a moment to appreciate the fact
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.320]   that I have a really good like a pro-level stills camera.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.320]   I have a laptop.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.120]   I have an iPad.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.160]   I have a phone.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:04.600]   I have a little like an LED light, a task light, all the stuff
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.760]   that all will charge off of the same like couple
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.360]   little brick chargers that I have.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.960]   Do I really want to complicate that
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.000]   by having an additional sort of cable system
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   and an initial kind of thing like that?
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.520]   As much as-- and I acknowledge what Alex is saying--
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.840]   there's also in white paint marker
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.960]   I have on one of them that this is the--
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.920]   basically, this is the one that will power--
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:28.080]   that will charge the iPad Pro really, really quickly
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.200]   versus the other ones that are just fine for like the lower
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.120]   power devices.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.280]   That's absolutely acknowledged.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.240]   You have to label which ones are which.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.200]   But the fact that you have like--
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.400]   any one of these can charge any other one of these,
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.800]   including like the battery booster in my laptop bag.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.800]   That is such a value add.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:49.400]   And I cannot wait for the iPhone to have USB-C.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.200]   Someday--
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.600]   It's going to get rid of the port.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.040]   It's going to get rid of the port.
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.720]   And I'm going to be sad because like the matrix
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.520]   and the bounce are galactic and we pros need ports.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.520]   Anyway, I'm going to be salty about it.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.360]   I don't understand how that'll work
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.920]   without screwing people over somehow.
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.520]   But I'm waiting so I'm going to wait and see.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.680]   John-- John needs to be happy.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:07.880]   He'll be happy with us.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:10.680]   So at least they'll say no, that would be ridiculous.
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.920]   Sure, it'd be prettier, but that would be ridiculous.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.320]   Come on.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.000]   Good news for Mac users who want to play the latest Games GeForce
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.920]   now is M1 Native.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:24.160]   This is another one of those streaming services
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.760]   like Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:31.960]   And Amazon has a streaming service called Luna, I think.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.040]   I don't care.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.480]   I can't remember.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.040]   GeForce now is pretty awesome.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.720]   You can even get 4K streaming.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:42.280]   And it plays with the M1 natively.
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:47.760]   So if you're waiting to get a hot game on your M1,
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.440]   you can even buy--
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.760]   Fortnite.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:50.960]   Yeah, like Fortnite.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:51.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.200]   I don't know, it's Fortnite on--
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:54.720]   I think so.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.280]   Of course now, that would be hysterical.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.360]   That would be hysterical.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.880]   I'll have to check it out.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.840]   Let's see, what else?
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:10.480]   I think we are pretty good.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.360]   Any stories?
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.480]   I mean, there's a lot of little stories.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:16.640]   I could Spanish Prime Minister's mobile phone infected
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.000]   by Pegasus.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:18.760]   Nice.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.720]   I do.
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:21.440]   I am paying a lot of attention to it.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.960]   Again, we've talked about it in the past,
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.240]   but the return to work.
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:30.240]   I've had a couple of people that I know an Apple leave.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600]   For 20 years.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.360]   I always was nervous about recovering labor unrest.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.560]   But yeah, there is apparently--
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.080]   again, it's hard to know--
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.920]   a significant number of Apple employees who do not
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.280]   want to go back.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.120]   I mean, they want to stay working at Apple,
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.600]   but they don't want to go back to the campus.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:49.120]   And it's a pretty hot topic.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.720]   I mean, the fact that people are--
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.480]   and the problem is, I was really thinking about it,
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:55.680]   because I saw someone that I know--
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.840]   they just said, I'm leaving because of the--
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.960]   I want to stay where I'm at.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.040]   And the problem is, the golden handcuffs
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.520]   eventually become golden wings, because at some point,
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.880]   you have so much-- if you've been there for 20 years,
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.200]   you have so much stock that you're there,
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.760]   because you're excited to be there, or you're not.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.640]   Well, and also, you're there because you're excited to be there,
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.480]   or you don't have to really work anymore.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:15.400]   You've paid off your house.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:18.200]   You've got enough to live on for the rest of your life.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.320]   If you're frugal, so not even that frugal.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:25.520]   And so I think that if you're in a relatively good position
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.080]   at Apple, and you've been there for 20 years,
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.200]   it's a thing.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.480]   And so I think that-- and I've just
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:33.920]   noticed a surprising number of people
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.840]   that I've either worked within the past or knew
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.720]   that have been there for a long time,
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:43.320]   that I've heard rumblings that they're thinking of leaving,
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.440]   or they've left.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.120]   Apple's trying to respond to this
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:48.680]   with this hybrid working pilot.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:52.160]   But there was an open letter from Apple employees
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.280]   saying it's not the answer at all.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.520]   It's inflexible.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:57.960]   And it doesn't solve the problem.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:02.440]   They talk about the reasons why Apple wants you to return
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.840]   the serendipity that comes from pumping into colleagues,
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:05.600]   the in-person--
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.360]   I think there's a bigger reason, though.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.160]   I think it's a problem that Apple's been fighting for a while.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.240]   It's like, originally, when people came into Apple,
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.360]   the people who've been there for a while outnumber them,
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.560]   and they couldn't culturate them.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.200]   It's what we're talking about at the beginning of the show.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.600]   Apple's culture is very different.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.520]   They run almost like a bunch of little startups,
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.120]   very small teams, very focus-oriented, directly
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.320]   responsible individuals.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.320]   And new people would come in and they'd get enculturated.
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:28.480]   They would learn to literally bleed in six colors.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.160]   And they started hiring so many people
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:31.480]   that that got diluted.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.840]   And now, over the last two years, you
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:35.080]   have people who've never been on part of teams.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.440]   And the stuff that's happening on Slack with Apple,
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:40.320]   that doesn't happen at Apple, not traditional Apple.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.440]   And some of it is amazing, but it's still not
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.560]   the culture that Apple traditionally had.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.120]   And maybe that culture should change,
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.800]   but I think there's a lot of people who think that
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.280]   if they do just let this all go, then that
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.760]   is the end of the Steve Jobs era, the Apple culture.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.280]   Somebody who's also driven by two years of not having
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.400]   to commute and suddenly get in the car and seeing $6
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.560]   gallon gas prices and saying, I don't want to spend 20%
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:07.200]   of my workday driving to work.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.040]   Well, they could work from beaches and ski slopes
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:09.920]   for the last few years.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:10.920]   Look at that.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.560]   Well, also, there's a simple fact that something
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.880]   seem unfathomable until you are forced to fathom it.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.520]   So after two or three years of not going to this office,
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.840]   every single day, and not being exposed to the culture,
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:26.480]   every single day, you stop thinking yourself.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.440]   Your identity is less bound to being an Apple employee who
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.720]   works on the Apple campus.
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.880]   And you start to think of yourself more
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:36.880]   as I am an individual employee with a specific set
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.280]   of highly marketable skills that I could then apply
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.960]   to pretty much wherever I go.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.040]   I mean, this is what's happening all across society here,
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.080]   where as soon as you thought, well, I can't imagine not
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:50.520]   going to Apple, like Apple campus, I can't imagine not
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.880]   seeing these people, like five times a day.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.680]   So a lot of people are rethinking a lot of things
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.760]   they previously might have thought as bedrock parts
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.320]   of their lives and their careers.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.600]   The letter concludes.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.800]   Or as Steve said, quote, it doesn't make sense to hire smart
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.840]   people and then tell them what to do.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:12.280]   We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do, end quote.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.320]   Here we are, the smart people that you hired,
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.560]   and we are telling you what to do.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.600]   Please get out of our way.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.280]   There is no one size fits all solution.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:26.080]   Let us decide how we work best and let us do the best work
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.240]   of our lives.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.400]   That seems not unreasonable.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.120]   - I think that they're going against the grain.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.880]   It'll be really interesting to see how this turns out
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.240]   because I mean, in so many companies, I mean,
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.880]   obviously I have a lot of friends in a lot of different
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.360]   big companies and in so many of them,
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.440]   a lot of them are just like, well, I'm not going back.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.720]   And in their companies that are being allowed to do that
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.000]   because those companies are trying to hang on to everybody.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.320]   I mean, and the companies that are really trying to force
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:53.680]   everyone to go back are finding, you know,
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.800]   that they're competing against companies that are very
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.920]   aggressively saying it's okay to work from home,
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.880]   or it's okay to work from a remote pod,
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.800]   or it's okay to not have to be in Silicon Valley.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.520]   I mean, the prices, the housing prices in Silicon Valley
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:09.600]   went from absolutely crazy to completely bonkers.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.800]   Like, I mean, you know, it's a shack is a million dollars.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.840]   I mean, I don't even know if it's a buy at house.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.840]   - That's right, yeah.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:17.680]   - So the thing is, is that you're not asking someone
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.880]   just to work from a lot of these people during COVID,
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.360]   you know, they had a vacation house or they had something
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.960]   else or they moved away from the cities to be safer
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.000]   or whatever.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.120]   And now they're, you know, they're not in this.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.600]   I mean, 'cause this, you know,
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.440]   - I know, I know, I know.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:32.600]   - It's not the nicest place in the world.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.440]   - I know, God.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.960]   - I know who's been a year in Barbados working from home.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.200]   - I don't blame him for not wanting to come back.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.280]   - Oh, did you see the guy who got,
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.760]   there was a guy who got a job both,
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.680]   I think it was Microsoft and Amazon or something like that.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.800]   He tweeted about it.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.640]   He works full time for both companies.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.680]   He said it takes him like a little bit of time
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.880]   at Microsoft more time at the other company,
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.560]   but he effectively can manage both jobs
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.360]   and he still has like a rampant home life.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.200]   - Of course, that's what they are worried about, right?
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:03.000]   - Like, that's why they want you to come into the office.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:05.520]   Wow.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.760]   I will let you do I Justine's video for your pick,
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.600]   if you want, Renee. - Sure.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.840]   - Okay, so we'll save that.
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:16.880]   Let's do a take a break and do our picks of the week
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.480]   coming up next.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.360]   So glad Andy and Aco was just sleepy.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.200]   - Oh, God.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.560]   - I'm embarrassed, thank you.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.720]   - Don't be embarrassed.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.440]   - Thank you for your, well, no, because it seems
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:31.120]   as though a higher life form would have,
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.160]   would be okay with like, hey, gee, we have to be,
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.160]   we have to be awake by two in the afternoon
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.680]   because if we can manage it,
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.000]   I will just have this morning.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:38.640]   - I'm just happy you're entrapping around
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.160]   with a Google show across the street at Yale.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.160]   - I woke up this morning, I looked at the clock
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.560]   and it said like, it's noon.
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.840]   And I went, what the hell, the clock was broken.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.600]   Thank God, 'cause I leapt out of bed.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.200]   I said, oh my God, oh my God.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.160]   So I kind of know how you must feel, Andy.
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:55.080]   - Like, still two, six, yeah.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.960]   - It was like, oh my God, oh my God.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.080]   And then I looked out the window and said,
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.200]   it's not noon, it's seven, 30.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:04.200]   I said, you know, I am a grown adult,
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.200]   but sometimes I have to remind myself
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.040]   that when you get two or three hours of sleep
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:11.480]   because you have a really, you have a really,
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.960]   you went out with friends the night before
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.000]   and you're gonna be coming out early tomorrow morning
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.600]   to go see museums and things,
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:21.360]   that's not sleep abandoned, that's only sleep deferred, Andy.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.640]   So you're gonna be sleeping 15 or 16 hours straight
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:26.720]   if you, yeah.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.520]   - I know, as I get older, I wanna sleep less
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.200]   'cause I know my hours are dwindling
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:34.480]   and I don't wanna waste a single one unconscious,
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:35.320]   but you've got--
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.880]   - Well, that's where I have the adventure going,
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:40.520]   that my best work is far, far behind me.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.880]   (laughing)
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.040]   - I was wrong, I apologize.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:44.480]   It's Microsoft and Facebook.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.800]   He's got two jobs at Microsoft and Facebook
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.640]   and the Microsoft one piece.
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:48.480]   - That's it.
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.920]   - Very little time, that's Facebook job--
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:52.040]   - Yeah, nobody here has a commute, right?
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.600]   I have the longest commute of all of you guys
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.880]   and it's seven minutes toward a tour.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.120]   - Yeah, I have to, about three or four times a week,
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.840]   I now have to drive like 20 minutes to the stage.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.240]   - Oh no, Alex. - So stage.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.680]   - Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:07.560]   But it's a huge sandbox full of cameras
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.400]   and lights and things like that.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:10.240]   - It's not that bad.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.240]   - You don't mind.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.560]   You don't mind.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.000]   Our show today brought to you,
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.660]   and I mean brought to you quite literally,
[01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:20.080]   by Cash Fly, how do we know Cash Fly is amazing?
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.880]   We've been using them for more than a decade.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:26.240]   Cash Fly came to our rescue when I first launched to it
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:30.040]   because I realized I can't possibly get the audio out
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.040]   to everybody who wants to listen
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.760]   in anything less than 24 hours.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.400]   So we were trying to,
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.320]   we tried all sorts of things, bit torrent
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.760]   and all kinds of things.
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.000]   Finally, Matt Levine at Cash Fly said, "Let me help."
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.320]   Cash Fly is a CD and a content delivery network.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:49.280]   And it's one of the reasons when you download a show,
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.160]   audio or video from us,
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:54.400]   you get it instantly with no delays, no hiccups,
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.720]   and you're getting it from a server near you
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:00.600]   'cause Cash Fly has over 50 locations around the globe.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:04.720]   So it's always somewhere close to you.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.680]   I really like that.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.920]   Now Cash Fly has expanded.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:09.440]   With a new video product,
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.360]   Cash Fly's ultra low latency video streaming.
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.280]   You can go live in hours, not days,
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.720]   with Get Ready Sub 1 Second Latency.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.760]   Ditch your unreliable web RTC solution
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:23.360]   for their WebSocket Live video workflow.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.440]   It can scale to millions of simultaneous users.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:31.120]   It's just mind boggling.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:34.600]   And with Cash Fly and their 50 plus locations
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.440]   and around the globe,
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.520]   your content's gonna be closer to your customers
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.280]   than ever before.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.760]   Take a look at Cash Fly's storage optimization system.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:44.720]   This is something we've been using for some time.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.680]   I think they gave it to us before.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:47.640]   They gave it to the public.
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:48.920]   It's now available to everybody.
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.200]   You can reduce bandwidth
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.480]   and increase your Cash Hit ratio to 100%
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.280]   while taking a load off your origin servers,
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.040]   reducing S3 bills.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:02.040]   Cash Fly's SOS storage optimization system.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.240]   And of course, don't forget,
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.440]   with Cash Fly's Elite Managed Packages,
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:08.400]   VIP treatment 24/7 support,
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.520]   response times in less than an hour.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.280]   Cash Fly's amazing.
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.160]   Look at all the people who use Cash Fly,
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.880]   including us for more than a decade.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:21.400]   So to recap, ultra low latency video streaming
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.920]   to more than a million concurrent users,
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.200]   lightning fast gaming,
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.640]   it'll deliver downloads faster
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.880]   with zero lag glitches or outages.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.680]   There's Twitch right in there.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.160]   Mobile content optimization
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:36.200]   that offers automatic and simple image optimizations.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.080]   So your site loads faster on any device
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.200]   and multi CDN for redundancy and failover,
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.960]   intelligently balancing your traffic
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.160]   across multiple providers
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.680]   to give you the shortest routes
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:49.720]   mitigating against performance glitches.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.480]   It works so well, they've had 100%,
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:55.200]   100% availability over the past 12 months.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.640]   10 times faster than the traditional methods we were using.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:00.120]   On six continents,
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:03.280]   30% faster than other major CDNs
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:07.520]   and a 98% Cash Hit ratio, Cash Fly's the best.

[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.840]   Thank you, Cash Fly,
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:45.400]   for everything you've done for us over the years.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:49.160]   Now, time for your picks of the week.
[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.640]   I'm gonna start with
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.560]   Alex Lindsey from officehours.globalalex.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.640]   And this is really an office hours recommendation.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:02.760]   One of our members, Grant Whitehead,
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:06.160]   actually suggested this and of course I follow most
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.640]   of what Grant thinks is a good idea.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.360]   Oh, I want this.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.840]   This is...
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:13.880]   So this is a, what's called a 12 South hover bar.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:14.720]   12 Souths, great.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.560]   It has a platform and this platform is hefty.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.480]   This is like it's got some weight to it.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:21.440]   And then it's got this arm
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.960]   that you can just kind of move your iPad.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:26.960]   And it's just a solid, a very, very solid,
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.440]   and again, Grant recommended,
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:31.480]   and I know that he's pretty, he's about as picky as I am.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.920]   So I was like, oh, I'll just go ahead and buy it.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.680]   And it's only, I think it's like $60 or something like that.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.600]   It's not a particularly expensive arm for this kind of thing.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.520]   And you really feel it because again,
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.320]   it's metal construction.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.480]   There's a couple of plastic pieces up here
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.240]   that hold the iPad, but the arm itself is metal.
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:48.880]   There's a lot of different ways
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.600]   that you can configure the iPad very easily for,
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.360]   for that kind of use.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.640]   It also comes with this little clamp.
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.480]   Oh, this is the...
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.280]   So you can do it up to the side clamp.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.560]   You can hang it from something.
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.040]   You can also hook it to your desk, you know,
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.000]   as a separate arm.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.960]   So it's, it's, and it all comes together.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.280]   There's a whole bunch of options on Amazon,
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.040]   just got the basic one.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.800]   They try to sell you a bunch of extra things.
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:14.000]   So anyway, so, but this is, you know,
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.120]   the $69 version or the $59 version or whatever is the,
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.400]   is the one that's there, but yeah.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.080]   - That's so cute.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.200]   - And it works really well.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:24.880]   And you feel like the, you know, it's a secure connection.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.920]   Like this is not going anywhere.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:27.840]   And it's just spring loaded.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.880]   So it's easy to put together.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.720]   And I have to, for my office hours,
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.920]   I'm in the hotel more often now.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.240]   So I go to LA a little bit.
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:39.440]   And I'm putting this in because I need a separate screen
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.280]   to manage some stuff.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:41.520]   And I was like, well, this will all fold up.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.760]   And I can put it in my, in my carry on.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:45.600]   - Yeah.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.440]   - So along with other things.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.800]   And so, but it's a really, really great stand.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.640]   - So it looks like it fits one size fits all.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:54.160]   Would it fit a 12.9 inch?
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.000]   - Yeah.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:55.840]   - Oh wow.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.880]   - Yeah, it just, it just pulls open.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.000]   - Down to the iPhone and all the way up to the biggest.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.640]   - I don't think down to the iPhone.
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.480]   I think there would be any.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:04.000]   - Oh no, this is iPad.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:04.840]   You're right.
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:05.680]   - Yeah, I think it's an iPad.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:07.640]   I think it's, it would do it.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:10.240]   - It would do it to the iPad mini though.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:11.080]   - It would, it would do it.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:14.960]   - It says, holds iPad or iPhone in infinite positions.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:18.600]   It says it on the, it says it here.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.880]   - I think that you would have to, I mean, I think that.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.720]   - Not that way, huh?
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.720]   - I think that you would have to do it.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.200]   Like, it could do it.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.520]   Like, so here's the,
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.640]   - Here's show Alex's.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:28.480]   - So there, yeah.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.480]   - So there's,
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.320]   - Oh well that works.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.160]   - I mean, it works.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.920]   It just, you just, and then you could just turn it.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.120]   So you could absolutely put, yeah, you could put your iPhone.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:35.960]   - You wouldn't hold it.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:36.840]   - You'd hold it lengthwise, yeah.
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.840]   - Yeah.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.440]   - So it does work for the iPhone.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.920]   - Nice, nice.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.760]   - It's like.
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:43.720]   - I'm gonna buy one from my mom for Mother's Day.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:44.560]   - It's really great.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.440]   - 'Cause we talk on FaceTime on her iPad
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.760]   and she's always like,
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.440]   - You're always looking at stuff.
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.280]   - Yeah.
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:53.000]   - Oh yeah, always looking at the ceiling.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:53.840]   (laughing)
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.280]   - Yeah, it's a top of the camera.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.280]   - I have, I have a mother-in-law.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.280]   And a mother-in-law.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:59.280]   (laughing)
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.400]   - Oh, that's great.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:03.480]   I'm gonna be, I think I'll get one for Lisa too.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.280]   Wow, 12 South makes good stuff.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.120]   - Great.
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:06.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:07.800]   - You do.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.600]   - Wow, okay, good pin.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.640]   - And they still make the compass.
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:12.480]   Oh, it's awesome.
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.160]   My favorite tabletop stand.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.880]   - I have a few of their stands, I think.
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:17.720]   - Yeah.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.560]   - Yeah.
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:19.560]   - And so they make so many things,
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.560]   they're just, like even if you're on the fence,
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:22.960]   oh, I don't need a,
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.440]   I don't really need an understanding look at it.
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.600]   I kind of wanna own that object.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.240]   It's a beautifully designed thing.
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:30.400]   - Yeah.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.040]   Very good pick, thank you.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.200]   Yeah, you're right, 67 bucks on Amazon.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.760]   And I get it, time for Mother's Day.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.240]   Okay.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.400]   Andy and I go, your pick of the week.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.920]   - You know, I've been looking at,
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:45.400]   for ever since I got an iPad,
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:47.280]   I've been looking at note-taking apps.
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.480]   And it's, I think I know why there's so many different
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.160]   note-taking apps for the iPad,
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.000]   because there are, really,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.880]   there's just no one-size-fits-all for everybody.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.840]   The notes app that you get for free
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:03.760]   is fine, but my, my, it's, it's insufficient for me
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.760]   because when I'm taking notes on the iPad,
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.000]   I have either, I'm either in a text mode,
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.880]   in which case I don't wanna be bothered by drawing tools,
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.720]   or I'm in a free-thinking drawing mode,
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:17.960]   where I'm, I really, I really am here to take handwritten notes
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.280]   and add a combination of notes and sketches
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.400]   as I go along in arrows, circles and arrows
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.800]   and paragraphs on the back of each one.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.160]   And it's really hard to get that dialed in specifically
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.640]   for exactly what you want.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.440]   The closest I've recently discovered
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.720]   an app called PenBook that I really like
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.600]   because of two things.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:38.600]   Number one, the pen interface is, it's not clunky.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:42.240]   One of my problems with note-taking apps on the iPad
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.280]   that use a lot of pen input is that,
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.080]   it seems as though a third of the interface
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:47.800]   is just toolbars and stuff like that.
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.320]   I don't want that, I wanna be able to focus
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.360]   just on this sheet of paper.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:53.680]   The other thing though is that it has
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:57.320]   and like truly hundreds and hundreds of different templates,
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:00.120]   meaning that what are you drawing on top of?
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.600]   Are you drawing on like college-ruled notebook paper?
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.920]   Are you drawing on grid paper?
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:07.800]   Are you drawing on layout paper for designing user interfaces?
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.240]   Are you designing on like music grid paper?
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:14.160]   And the thing is you can customize these things.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:18.880]   The buzzword they use is smart background paper
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.920]   where it's not just, oh, we just,
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.720]   we did something in Adobe Illustrator
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:24.400]   and you can use that as the background.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.280]   For instance, when you're using it as like a calendar planner,
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.440]   you can adjust how big these grids are.
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:34.440]   And also it understands that, oh, well today is May 4th,
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.520]   excuse me, May 3rd, I'm sorry, I've been asleep all week.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:39.240]   I don't know what it is.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.720]   Meaning that if you open to today's calendar page,
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.720]   it will open at two Tuesday, May 3rd.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:46.920]   - I know, we're May 4th, you would have your cinnamon bun hair
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:50.560]   and your brass bra on right now, so.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:51.840]   - Exactly, go ahead.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.720]   - Or, that's how I know it's not May 4th yet.
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:42:00.720]   - Excuse me, I'm gonna be working on my R2 R5 D4 robot
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.760]   and taking it to hospital.
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:08.000]   But yeah, so essentially, when I'm doing handwritten notes,
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.640]   I really just want, don't give me any organization,
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.240]   don't get me any order.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:14.760]   This is for free form note taking and thinking.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:15.760]   And this one gives me,
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:18.800]   it lets me, gives me the freedom to do free form notes
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.240]   and change colors, change pens, change styles,
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.360]   while still having the ability to,
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.640]   I'm designing a user face for a website.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.600]   I really do want that grid format,
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.440]   'cause otherwise, my notes are gonna take a look like a mess.
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:33.760]   And it doesn't do cool things like here is,
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:38.320]   here is the, these 18 pages of notes as a text file,
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.200]   but it will export as PDF, as any kind of format you want.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.480]   And it also will do search based on what you have written.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:48.720]   So it does use, it does use all the pen,
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:51.240]   handwriting APIs that are built into iOS.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.760]   It's really cool, again, it's simple enough
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:56.960]   and complicated enough to be kind of in the butter zone.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:59.560]   So it's, I've been using it a lot.
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:02.520]   My usual, my usual indication is,
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.920]   am I still using it eight hours later?
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:06.920]   And I've been using it now for two or three weeks.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.880]   We'll see if I'm still using it in two or three months,
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.920]   but it's definitely good enough to recommend, I think.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.520]   - I have all the notepad apps for the iPad,
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.360]   but none of them do just this,
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.960]   which is exactly all I really need,
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:21.280]   like is graph paper, a variety of different papers.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.440]   That's really cool.
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:23.280]   This is nice.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:24.120]   - How much is it?
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.520]   - And the light, it's annual subscription.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:30.280]   I think it's something like, I'm on the wrong page.
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:35.040]   I think it's something like $10 a year, I think.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.680]   - Not much.
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:37.760]   - It's not much.
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:40.160]   I'm sorry, don't have that in front of me.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.520]   - Okay, I'm loading it right now.
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:42.360]   Let's see.
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.840]   It's free within app purchases.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:45.680]   - Right.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:49.240]   - So you decide, probably you have to pay for paper
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:52.280]   and different papers and stuff, stationary packs,
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.320]   I would guess, yeah.
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:56.480]   - Okay.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.680]   - It's not endless, it's not endless in app purchases.
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:01.640]   Not as though, oh, like,
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:03.640]   gee, I'm sorry, will you wanna use the eraser?
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:07.800]   It's about half of 0.001 in Ethereum per stroke.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.600]   - Oh, you get all of the stationary and writing features
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.920]   in a single notebook for free forever.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.200]   Premium lets you create and export unlimited notebooks,
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:16.760]   receive access to new stationary,
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.080]   it covers as it is signed,
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:19.680]   and get regular app updates.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:20.520]   Okay.
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.960]   - That's what you can have a lifetime purchase as well.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:23.800]   - Right.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:24.640]   - That's not the thing I've tried to mention.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.040]   You can have multiple of these things.
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.320]   So one can just be a sketchbook for ideas,
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.920]   nothing could be an actual project.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:35.040]   - Lifetime is $37.99, penbook pro $14.99 a year,
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:36.640]   15 bucks a year.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.160]   - Nice, this is good.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:39.160]   I've been looking for this.
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.240]   From user camp, penbook.
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.600]   - Yep, iPhone and Apple.
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.640]   - They also started off using writing pen apps
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:47.960]   for like other platforms too.
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:48.800]   So it's not as though.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.920]   - Yeah, there's a Windows version.
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:50.760]   Which is kind of cool.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.480]   - They have some, yeah, the blog post they wrote about this
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:54.320]   is pretty good.
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.040]   They wrote pen book 'cause they just were
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.240]   kind of interested intrigued by what Apple was doing
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:44:59.480]   with their pen APIs,
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.560]   and they wanted to see like what they were to work with,
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:02.720]   and they were just having so much fun
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:03.720]   that by the time they finished,
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.360]   they actually wrote a really good app.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.280]   I started selling it.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.800]   - Nice.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.240]   Nice.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:10.760]   - Renee Richie.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.000]   You had a pick of the week, sir.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.600]   So friend of the show, friend of many of ours,
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.360]   Justine Azerik, I Justine,
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.360]   had the opportunity to go to the fitness plus studios
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.200]   in Venice Beach.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:24.280]   I think it's Venice Beach, California outside Los Angeles.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:25.640]   And she had to talk to J Blonick,
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.000]   who is vice president of fitness technologies at Apple,
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.720]   and tour the studio, which looks magnificent.
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:35.280]   It is basically like Alex and I were chatting about it
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.640]   before the show started.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.560]   It is like Nirvana studio.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.320]   It is just so beautifully designed, so well lit,
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:45.840]   so well photographed and captured.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.480]   And she shows a little bit of what it's like
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:49.240]   in their switching room and what it's like
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.240]   when they shoot it.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.520]   She speaks to Jessica Sky, who's one of their trainers.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.400]   It does a lot of the thoughtful, more meditative,
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.520]   more yoga focused contents.
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.160]   And I hope I'm gonna pronounce the name like Bakari,
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:00.320]   I think is how you pronounce it,
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.200]   who just looks like he's a Marvel superhero,
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:05.120]   just completely chiseled from some metal that,
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:08.000]   or stone that doesn't exist on our planet.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.760]   But they were talking about how they think about it,
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:11.600]   and some of the stuff that's been going on
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.400]   the last 18 months and how they launched during,
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:17.120]   at the end of 2020, which was both really good
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.440]   because it allowed people to bring this into their homes,
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.960]   and use this in a situation where maybe you didn't have
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:24.000]   the option of, or most people didn't have the option
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.360]   of going into a gym, but how they're expanding it
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.280]   with time to walk and now time to run.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.560]   And they've got so much more offered now.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.360]   They work out for pregnant women and they have
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:36.360]   a pre-ski workout, and they're continually expanding it
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.000]   and adding new content.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000]   And just sort of the process they go through
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.560]   when they plan out a class and when they practice it,
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.880]   and when they get input from the other trainers.
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.960]   And it's a really interesting look at Fitness Plus.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:51.080]   With the enthusiasm that I love so much,
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:53.360]   especially like we get so cynical about tech,
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.400]   sometimes in the industry, because unlike regular people,
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:57.920]   we get a new phone every two weeks.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.960]   They're not special to us anymore when someone else
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.600]   might get a new phone every four years,
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.240]   and they care deeply about it,
[01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.600]   or we might get to try every service from every vendor,
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.880]   like a pellet on one day, a Fitness Plus the next,
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.200]   but a lot of people don't.
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.120]   So I really appreciate how excited she gets about this.
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:14.080]   But I think it's sort of like more
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.840]   what a normal person would react to
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.320]   when they suddenly have all of this available
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:18.800]   in their gym or in their home.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.240]   - Very nice. - It's well worth checking out.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.400]   - So on I Justine's channel, she is, by the way,
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:27.560]   we're glad to say, in good shape after her incident.
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:31.160]   She was hospitalized for, was it a blood clot?
[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.440]   - Blood clot, yeah. - Yeah, but she's gonna
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.680]   talk really good care of her.
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.040]   They didn't have to take her ribs out,
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.800]   so that's good, she's on blood thinners right now,
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.080]   but otherwise, obviously, she looks in the peak of health.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.440]   - Although-- - And she is lightsaber lethal.
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:45.480]   - I didn't realize how tall.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.120]   Either Jay Blonick is really tall,
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:49.280]   or Justine is shorter than I thought.
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:51.600]   - So I don't know if you ever saw the Winter Soldier,
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.240]   but there's a scene where Steve Rogers
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:54.920]   just keeps doing laps around the falcon,
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:56.800]   he keeps thing on your left, on your left.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.120]   I believe Jay does that for California every day.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.480]   Like he just goes from San Francisco down to Santa Monica,
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.640]   on your left. - Yeah.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.720]   - And Alex, you were talking,
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:10.480]   before the show began, about some of the equipment there.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:14.360]   In particular, this robotic pedestal camera.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:17.480]   - Yeah, that's a, I think, I'm not 100% certain,
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:21.400]   but I think that that is a telemetrics pedestal.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:25.520]   So it's a, that little platform actually moves around.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:27.320]   So you can program not only-- - That's why it has a green
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:30.080]   and red light on it, so it's like a port and starboard
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.840]   light on a boat, so you know how to avoid getting run over by it.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:36.720]   - Yeah, and so, but you can program it to run,
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:38.120]   to go somewhere else.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.200]   Now, I've not seen that arm put on those scenes.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.440]   - It's really cool. - So it's like a little mini-tube.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:45.120]   - That's really, they must have some great motion.
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:46.200]   - Yeah, it's really-- - Yeah.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.720]   - So it's pretty slick. - That is a nice tool.
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.000]   - I mean, there's definitely, I'm pretty sure,
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.400]   I wasn't sure I looked through some images.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.680]   I'm pretty sure that's a grass valley switcher.
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:00.800]   So there's definitely a spared no expense moment of that.
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.320]   I mean, that studio is, they spent all the money on it.
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:05.640]   Like it's not, no, listen around. - Yeah, why would they?
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.480]   - I know, exactly.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.520]   Well, that's the best part of when Apple does content,
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:10.160]   you're just like, oh, it's gonna be fun just to look at.
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:12.360]   - Yeah, it's so nice too, of the studio.
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.720]   - It's actually a really clean studio.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:16.520]   We had grass valley-- - It's immaculate, yeah.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.760]   - So it's tech TV, but this looks much nicer
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:21.440]   than the old school. - I'm not 100% certain.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:23.880]   I'm still trying to find the same button configuration,
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.160]   but it looks like it is.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:28.600]   - That's probably custom built by grass valley for Apple.
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:30.800]   - Wait, Alex has got off at Amazon,
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:33.120]   if they're gonna have a 30 minute talk and they'll figure it out.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.160]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly. - That's like a--
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.280]   - How long between like what Apple just happens to mention,
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.720]   you know, you've got this knob over here.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:43.120]   It would be nice if it were like four inches higher.
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:44.960]   How long do they have to wait before they send them
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.920]   a brand new one of those with the knob, four inches higher?
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.960]   - Yeah, it's exactly. - It's getting a power bar or not.
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:53.480]   - Posted six hours ago, already 26,000 views,
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:55.960]   part of iJustine's tech Tuesday playlist,
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:00.960]   Apple Fitness Plus Studio Tour YouTube.com/iJustine.
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:04.520]   - Thank you, gentlemen.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.560]   Andy, we're gonna dock you for an hour's pay,
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.560]   I hope you don't mind.
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.040]   (laughing)
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.840]   - No, sorry. - I think it's buying drinks
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.680]   after the show.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:13.640]   - There you go. - Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:17.240]   - That would be, I would be like again, everybody here.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:22.080]   Enjoy this $8 gift card to start, but I apologize.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:27.000]   - When are you gonna be on WGBH at Boston next?
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.440]   - Friday 1230 in the afternoon, go to WGBHNews.org
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:32.800]   live or later to stream it.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:34.320]   I will not be in the studio of the library,
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.880]   but I will be on.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.240]   - Nice.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.640]   - You never sleep through that, do you?
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.520]   - No, because, see, that's the problem.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.280]   If I know that I have to be out of the house by 8 a.m.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.120]   to make a train, that's like, no,
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.280]   there's no way I'm oversleeping for that.
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:50.640]   If it's like, no, so long as you're awake
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.760]   20 minutes before you go on, you've already done your works,
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.960]   that's when, oh.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:56.240]   - That's why we have a studio,
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:58.720]   'cause if it were in my house, I'd miss it all the time.
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:50:59.560]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:00.960]   - I completely understand. - Pause dance.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:01.960]   - Thank you, Alex.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:06.160]   ReneeRitchie, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:08.720]   - The latest video, reaction video on USB-C,
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.880]   there's also that video we talked about earlier
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:15.560]   about, I forgot what, something good.
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.120]   - Oh, yeah, Apple Silicon for the upcoming episodes.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.440]   - Apple Silicon for the Apple.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.000]   Yeah, why they're not using an A15.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.320]   - It's gorgeous, yeah.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:24.560]   - Yeah, always a great place to get thoughtful.
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:26.520]   - I'm trying to do videos that nobody else can do,
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.960]   'cause I found like a lot of the videos
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:28.800]   are the same these days,
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.240]   and I don't wanna be like the third video
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:31.080]   on any specific topic.
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:32.240]   - Good for you. - I'm gonna do stuff that.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.080]   - Yes.
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:34.520]   - That more caters to what I do for, yeah.
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:35.360]   - Yeah.
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:36.200]   - That's exactly what you should do.
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.040]   - That's exactly what you should do.
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:37.880]   - What kind of view is everything?
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:39.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:44.640]   Alex Lindsey, he does it all day long at officehours.global.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:48.680]   He's of course employed by Oh9o.medias,
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:50.840]   so if you wanna hire him, that's where you should go.
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:54.520]   And if you are interested in learning about production,
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:56.680]   I don't know, a million things go to office hours.
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:00.040]   - It's funny, 'cause it just, the range is so wide.
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:02.120]   You know, we started talking, we're starting to cover events,
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:04.600]   so we still recovered NAB to some degree.
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:07.120]   We went down to the Cyber Rodeo,
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.240]   or some of our members went down to the Cyber Rodeo,
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:10.360]   and we're gonna start ramping that up.
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.520]   So Monday we're talking about how we did that,
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:14.120]   and then today we were talking about Synths
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:16.320]   with Carl Esmeusen and Nick Bat,
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:18.360]   who's got a big YouTube channel on Synths.
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:21.040]   And tomorrow we're talking about modeling in 3D,
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:24.920]   and then on, we have one of the product managers
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:28.080]   from Zoom, from webinar, coming on to talk about new features
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.280]   on Thursday, and then we have someone who works
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.120]   in the, actually a new tech on the booths,
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:33.960]   and we're just planning Elsse.
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:35.480]   - It's funny, 'cause he's part of the Booth,
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:38.040]   the event team, and so he's gonna come and talk

[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.680]   - Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astra Magazine.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:39.760]   And each week I'm joined by Tariq Malek,
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:42.480]   the editor in chief over at space.com.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.560]   In our new This Week in Space podcast,
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.800]   every Friday, Tariq and I take a deep dive
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:48.960]   into the stories that define the new space age.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:50.120]   What's NASA up to?
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:52.800]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:54.920]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.360]   When are those coming home?
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.600]   What the heck has Elon Musk done now?
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.320]   In addition to all the latest and greatest
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:02.960]   in space exploration, we'll take an occasional look
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:04.320]   at bits of space flight history
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:06.080]   that you probably never heard of,
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:09.320]   and all with an eye towards having a good time along the way.
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:11.520]   Check us out in your favorite podcatcher.
