[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.960]   This is Mac Break Weekly and we are really pleased to gather,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.760]   together, some of the greatest experts in the history
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.240]   of Apple and Macintosh.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.760]   No, that's really hyperbole.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.000]   We're just glad to be here talking about Macintosh's
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.720]   in our 99th episode.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.280]   Merlin Mann is here from 43 Folders and you look nice today.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.640]   Hello, Mr. Mann.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.480]   >> Hello, Leo.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.480]   How are you today?
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.480]   >> Very well.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480]   Good to talk to you.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.480]   >> It's very nice to be here.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.560]   >> We were talking, and we will talk in a moment about the best ways
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.200]   to conserve battery life on your new 3G iPhone,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   which you don't have.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.080]   You're still on an old one.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.560]   >> I have what we refer to in the industry as the old iPhone.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560]   >> Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   Have you --
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   >> Is that the old iPhone?
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.800]   >> That's the old.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.000]   Have you upgraded the firmware, though?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   >> All right.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   >> So really, the truth is you have 90% of what the rest of us.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   >> I can't -- I --
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Leo, since this came out, I haven't gotten a thing done.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.640]   I've just been calculating tips on every available.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.800]   I can -- you know what's really good?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.240]   Have you seen AAAAA, a excellent tip calculator?
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.640]   >> You left out the space at the front.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.520]   >> That's why I was at the top.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.400]   >> We'll talk about that, too.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   Arnold Kim is here.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.280]   We're really pleased to have Arnold on.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.840]   Should I call you Dr. Kim?
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.480]   >> You don't have to.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.960]   He's called me Arnold.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.560]   >> Big article about Arnold in the New York Times this week.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.400]   Arnold is the founder and a guy behind Mac Rumors was doing -- going to medical school
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.720]   during the early days of Mac Rumors and now practiced medicine for some time.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.320]   And now you've decided maybe this Internet thing's got some legs.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.200]   >> Even up the medical practice, huh?
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   >> Yep.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.040]   June 30th was my last day and now I'm full-time web, Mac Rumors, and whatever other projects
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.040]   I want to work on.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040]   >> Very cool.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   That's very exciting.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.040]   I'm very excited, very happy with this decision.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.720]   >> How's mom feel?
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.320]   Parents were surprisingly supportive about it.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.600]   You know, they -- I always worry about -- I guess it never really changes, but you worry
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.040]   about your parents, like, agreeing with your decisions.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.520]   But, you know, they were actually on board.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.520]   Wow.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.080]   I know if I had made it through med school, as if I even made it through college.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.560]   But if I had made it through med school, my parents might have had some qualms that I
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.800]   decided to give it all up for podcasting.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   >> That's funny.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   You should see that.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.960]   Because my entire childhood, I mean, from the beginning, certain things were banged into
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960]   my head.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.640]   One was that I was going to go to college and I was going to really -- I was going to
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   make something to myself.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.880]   And the second was, my mother really wanted me to be a blogger.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.880]   >> Fair.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.600]   You know, from very early on, I went to special schools.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.080]   I had the shoes.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   All of it.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.640]   And so, really, obviously, my mother's very happy.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.040]   >> So she -- does she have a bumper sticker, you know, "My Son the Blogger"?
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.080]   >> My son was Blogger of the Month at the Internet.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.080]   [ Laughter ]
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.480]   >> Oh, well, Annie Ennaca's going to join us in just a little bit, but we're going to
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.840]   talk about Mac stories.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.600]   It's kind of fun to have Mr. Mac Rumor's on because we usually are quoting Mac Rumor's
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.840]   throughout most of the show, so we're getting it from the Rumor's mouth, so to speak.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.960]   First of all, let me ask you, Arnold.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.300]   Has Apple ever -- a suit you?
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.860]   Has Apple ever come down on you?
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.120]   Do you hear from them at all?
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.280]   >> Yeah, I hear from them intermittently.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.840]   I try to stay out of their, you know, legal sites, but, you know, there's definitely been,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.440]   you know, photos or, you know, I think there was an iPod interface movie that was posted.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.880]   And they'll certainly send out cease and desist letters to get that stuff off.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.840]   I mean, you know, I think, as you know, Mac Rumor's tends to be more of an aggregator, you know,
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.440]   so in that way we can avoid that sort of, you know, too much legal pressure.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.240]   But, you know, the threats there, but like I said, I've had a reasonably friendly relationship
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.400]   with Apple's legal department where they'll tell me to stop doing something.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.560]   >> Hi, Arnold.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   It's a --
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   >> It's the end.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.000]   >> And I'll stop doing it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.280]   >> Do they ever harm your pets?
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   [ Laughter ]
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.520]   >> Ever get a snake in the mailbox?
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.520]   Anything like that?
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.320]   >> Let me put that differently, Arnold.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.240]   Have you ever been able to prove that Steve harms your pets?
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.880]   Because I imagine he's pretty slick about it.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.320]   >> Now that's a leading question, sir.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.120]   >> You're flying like beard hairs in your cap bowl or anything like that?
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.160]   >> The funniest interaction I think was back.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.320]   I don't know if you know, I'm sure you all remember.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:42.480]   Back before WWDC a few years ago, Apple leaked the G5 Power Mac on their store site.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   >> Right.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.520]   >> Yeah, it was up for like, I don't know, half an hour, an hour, and like it was like
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   a week before.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.160]   It was in the evening, too.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.520]   And of course, people send it in, we posted it, blah, blah.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.360]   It's just factual information from their own website.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.160]   But I got a call from Apple Legal at 2 in the morning asking -- it was like a friend.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.960]   Obviously, 2 in the morning, it's sort of a friend to call.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.480]   They're trying to plug up.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.480]   Obviously, it was too late.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.800]   There's nothing they could do about it.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.160]   They were real friendly about it, and they're just trying to get different.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.760]   >> All right, and on which mind terribly, there's this picture.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.840]   We're not too happy about it.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   And what did you do?
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.240]   You say thanks, but really, it's, I can't.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.760]   >> I took it off for them, but it's too late.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   >> So you're very cooperative.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.240]   >> Well, you know, Apple Legal's involvement's usually actually an interesting sign.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.640]   It usually triggers a lot more -- it's obviously it's confirmation.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.120]   I mean, obviously in that situation, for the people that actually saw it on Apple site,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.120]   they were pretty sure.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.640]   But, you know, I mean, for people who weren't up at, like, whatever, or weren't browsing
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.520]   the web at 9 p.m., it just serves as additional confirmation.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.080]   And then, same with the image and stuff.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.640]   I don't -- usually, it's out there.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:05.680]   I don't work too hard to -- it would take a lot of effort to try to fight it with a little
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.680]   gain for me.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.320]   >> Did you ever have a story that you just knew you couldn't run, but you just knew it
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.760]   was true, and you were just sitting on it and just dying to run it?
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.840]   >> I don't know.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.520]   There's always stuff that makes me a little nervous, depending on, you know, someone who
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.280]   had submitted some iPhone -- or iPod interface movies.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.680]   It looked really -- you know, but you can never tell what these things are.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.680]   >> You never know.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   I know.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   There's never any fakes out there.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.280]   I don't care on the side of caution and tend not to -- you know, unless I'm a little more
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.240]   sure, unless there's -- you know, unless it originates from somewhere that's more obvious.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.200]   But, you know, I mean, like I said, generally, we don't -- I don't publish a whole lot of,
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.680]   you know, breaking, you know, just straight from, like, you know, every --
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.960]   >> You know, like, things secret was.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.360]   You don't run that risk.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.440]   >> You know, and that's, you know, that's a conscious decision in some ways, because,
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.040]   you know, there's obviously -- you open yourself up to a lot more legal issues.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.520]   >> I think it's been interesting to watch.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.600]   The site, I'm not -- I mean, I'm not a constant reader.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.960]   Like anybody else when things start heating up around a product.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   >> That's where you go.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.240]   >> Yeah, it is a place that I go.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.080]   And I mean, this is just an observation from somebody who doesn't visit the site a lot.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.480]   But it's -- I think it's interesting how I used to write you guys off as just another
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.000]   one of these squirrely make stuff up and put up a crappy Photoshop picture site, which
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.360]   I think today, increasingly, is not true and probably not fair.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.600]   >> Oh, no, very much not so.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   Yeah, I think you --
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600]   >> I think about myself, I want to --
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.720]   >> I thought myself having had that opinion and then say that like a site like, you know,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.160]   Boing Boing and It's Hey Day, you become an aggregator, as you say.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.240]   People -- you're the first place people want to hand stuff to.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.240]   >> Exactly.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.240]   >> Do you think they find something good?
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.720]   So it seems like has your role changed over the years?
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.000]   I mean, like when you're a young blogger or a young publisher, younger, you know, you're
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.320]   so obsessed with just getting lots of stuff up.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.800]   Has your role changed to being that of an editor who's really kind of just trying to think
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.720]   what goes on the second page versus the home page and stuff like that?
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.320]   I mean, there are ways that it hasn't, it hasn't.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.520]   I mean, obviously, when I had a smaller audience posting things didn't have as much impact,
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.280]   you know, in terms of I didn't get that much feedback earlier on.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.840]   But you know, I think throughout, I guess what I tell people is I take rumors very seriously.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.440]   It's not -- you know, I think rumors, sites in general sort of have a bad reputation.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.440]   People sort of see them as just unreliable, just posting gossip and whatever.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.600]   And I don't know, maybe just from -- because I had a science background, I don't know, I'm
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.560]   very sort of more evidence-based, you know, certainly sort of trying to link back rumors,
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.120]   trying to see which sites are more reliable.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.800]   And you know, I definitely take a lot of sort of pride or editorial, you know, pride in
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.200]   sort of selecting what, you know, what's likely and what's not likely.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   And, you know, trying to keep that straight and also trying to like publish stuff that's
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   a little more reliable.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.480]   You know, and you know, the value of Mac rumors, of course, besides, you know, publishing these
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.960]   things and sort of aggregating and like linking them back, is, you know, it also draws a large
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   community.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.760]   So, you know, obviously, you know, whenever anything comes out, people just like talking
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   about it, you know.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.920]   >> Your forums seem to generate a lot of traffic.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   >> Yeah, no.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.680]   And then definitely during, like you said, like during launch weeks or, you know, events
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.240]   or, you know, lead up to Mac World or WWC or, you know, the iPhone launch was crazy.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.960]   There were like, you know, a thousand comments on a particular story, you know, on any particular
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.720]   story about, you know, mobile me not working right.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.760]   >> Or, or, you know, I had to talk about that.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.200]   Were there some problems with that?
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   >> I hear there's some problems.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   >> Small problem.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   I'm sure they're all fixed now.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   >> Probably.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   >> There's a lot to talk about today.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.800]   Before we get into the actual news stories, our guest Arnold Kim is the guy behind Mac
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.560]   rumors and Merlin Mans with us.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.720]   Annie Inako, as soon as he gets his Skype problems, Iron Down will join us.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.760]   I do want to welcome a new sponsor to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.000]   And it's the great folks at Visa.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.120]   Visa is the card we recommend when you shop online.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.720]   You know, you all have better things to do when you're shopping online than worrying
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.920]   about online fraud.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.840]   You know, you got to decide white, black, 16 gigs, 8 gigs.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   These things are important.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.520]   Well, that's the good news about Visa.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.360]   Online fraud is not an issue.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.120]   All purchases you make are safe and secure with Visa.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:12.040]   I made a recent purchase and I didn't use Visa and boy, I regret that $2,000 later.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.520]   Had I used Visa, I would have been fine.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.880]   Visa has real-time fraud monitoring.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.440]   It's really sophisticated software that they use to monitor your transactions, anything
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   out of the ordinary.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.160]   They see it right away.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.240]   Maybe you've received that call.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.480]   Did you buy something in Bosnia last night at 4 in the morning?
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   No.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.480]   Don't worry.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   We'll take care of it.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   Zero liability.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   That's the deal.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.480]   You're not liable.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   Well, unauthorized purchases.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.720]   We're really glad to have them on board and remind you when you shop online to use your
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   Visa.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.720]   That's peace of mind.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   Safe, secure, Visa.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.160]   I wish I'd use my Visa card when I bought those cameras.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.920]   But that's another story entirely.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.560]   So, you got it on V-bay and they actually sent you a picture of a camera?
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.080]   They didn't have the courtesy to even send the picture.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.000]   That's really what pissed me off.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.760]   They didn't even, they said, "Here's the tracking number."
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.880]   There was nothing ever sent under that tracking.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.160]   It was just a made up tracking.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.840]   They could have sent...
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.160]   One 9 NZ F7 Strawberry Simple for Pi.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160]   Exactly.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160]   It wasn't even...
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.840]   They could have had the courtesy to send an empty box.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.840]   But no.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   Nothing.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.960]   And of course, I bought it through PayPal, right?
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.000]   Instead of my credit card.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.760]   So, you have to go to PayPal.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.400]   PayPal said, "Here's your $200, but it was $200, well, it was only insured for $200."
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.920]   So, that's life.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.760]   I've learned Visa from now on and that's not part of the commercial.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.760]   That's actually...
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.160]   That's the true story.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.160]   So let me...
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.160]   Let me...
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.840]   There are so many great stories to talk about.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.680]   We're still in the iPhone aftermath.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.760]   You said you were just in the Apple store in San Francisco, Maryland and there are still
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   lines.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.400]   Yeah, I was at the Stockton Street flagship store yesterday and yeah, there was totally
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.880]   a line.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.240]   And I guess they had been out.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.480]   I have not been following this, but I guess everybody had been out.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.600]   And then somehow, maybe through the doctor's website, I'm not sure, but suddenly people
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.680]   became aware, maybe through some kind of spidey sense, but suddenly we're aware that more
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   phones were available.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.680]   They're our phones.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.760]   And of course, there's nothing like rain checks.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.560]   Of course, it's sweat equity.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   You got to stand there to get it.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.760]   So people just turned out and started waiting again.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.360]   According to Mac rumors, iPhone sales doubled this time.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.640]   Has that right twice the sales last year?
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.400]   Well, that's what AT&T said.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.200]   So that's US sales, I guess.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.200]   That's amazing.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.960]   Do you think that's the price Arnold?
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.760]   Is that what did it?
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.120]   Oh, well, certainly the price.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.280]   Yeah, I mean, I'm just anecdotally, I have friends that are on board now, people that
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.600]   aren't tech people who are like, once the new iPhone was announced, they were ready to
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   buy.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.520]   And twice as much is great.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.920]   But that's obviously limited by the stock they have.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.120]   If they had more stock, I'm sure they could sell more.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.120]   Most of the stores are sold.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.080]   If you use the Apple iPhone checker, it's sold out almost everywhere.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.680]   And yet, I have to think that some of these people who are buying their first iPhone are
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.280]   not having the experience Apple would like them to have.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.640]   Shall I put it that way?
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.480]   Let's let me list the problems.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.360]   Again, we're going to hit mail.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   I never get mail.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.520]   I never get mail about this show.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.760]   I think people know to leave me alone.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.400]   But I got a bunch of I got a fair amount for me of email people on both sides of what
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.400]   we talked about last week.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.600]   Well, anytime you say iPhone, you're going to get mail people from people who say, talk
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.320]   less about it, talk more about it.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.560]   That's what I got a lot of email from really non insane people who are like, you know,
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.680]   I'm glad you said something.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.880]   I think that was kind of weird the way that way.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   It did.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.880]   Well, you were right.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.880]   And you know what?
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.880]   It's still not going so well.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.280]   I'll give you an example.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:51.240]   The sink starts with a backup that takes an hour or two.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.920]   I get that every day.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   Every time.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.920]   Every time.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.000]   That's a that can't be this is bad.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Excuse me.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Hello.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.080]   The sink should be very quick after the first time.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.120]   The phone crashes all the time.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.200]   I think that's the applications, but I don't know.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.720]   And I've restored it now.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.440]   I've had it since the 12th.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.600]   So that means I've had it 11 days restored twice full restore, you know, the kind of
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.240]   restore where you hold down all the buttons and you hold them down, you hold them down
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.480]   to find it says, okay, connected to iTunes, please.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:28.280]   And it downloads a new version of the firmware for some reason and reinstalls on top of it.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.440]   Still having problems.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.560]   I think it's I'm not sure if it's the location based.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.680]   I'm not sure if these application, you know, part of it's got to be if you're an application
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   developer.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.120]   You didn't have any time to beta test.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.720]   You just you're throwing your beta out there and many of them have released new versions.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.080]   I get updates, several updates a day now.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.920]   I mean, you also couldn't actually have anyone to beta test.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.920]   Right.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   Right.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.680]   Craig Hockenberry has been a very see Hockenberry who makes Twitter difficult.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.160]   I'm talking to his Twitter name, see Hockenberry, but Craig has.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.160]   I call him Chockenberry.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160]   So it could be worse.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   Chockenberry.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   Yeah, Chockenberry.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160]   But he's been very vocal about this.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.000]   I think he's not the only one that man.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.120]   It's hard to make software if you can't test it with people and then find out or isolate
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.120]   what's going on.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.720]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff around NDA that's really frustrating developers right
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   now.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   Twitterific's fairly stable.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.240]   Twinkle crashes half the time on me.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.920]   I love Twinkle, but it's it's crashing all the time and these both of these applications.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.440]   Well, Twinkle's been a crack iPhone application for a long time.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.600]   So it's not like they're brand new to this.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.880]   Twitterific, you know, Craig's a good programmer.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.680]   He's Twitterific's a great piece of software.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   That's fantastic.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   I love it.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   So you just got to wonder if these all these new people are buying these iPhones, what are
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.680]   they thinking?
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.800]   Are they thinking this is the normal experience?
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.680]   They're thinking I had no idea that it was this hard to calculate 20% of something.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.280]   How many tip applications have you installed?
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.120]   You know, I haven't I haven't installed any, but it is pretty mind boggling.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.440]   I know it's kind of the easy joke to make about the iPhone store, but there is a tremendous
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.760]   amount of crap showing up.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.400]   So the question though, Leo, one thing is each of these is lives in their own sandbox, right?
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.680]   You can't access data from other places.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.440]   Is it fair to say that something's crashing?
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.080]   It's crashing because of your app.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.640]   Do they have a way to know?
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.920]   Oh, when you say it's sandboxed, how?
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.240]   Yeah, but yes, because I'll tell you, I can launch an app and the whole phone resets.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.240]   So something.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.040]   Also, you put in other words, you can't I'm sorry, I'm not a developer.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.360]   I'm an idiot, but like if you if your app crashes consistently at the same place, I
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.960]   mean, obviously that could be something with location services that's not right.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.800]   That's what it looks like to me.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   But is it your suspicion?
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   It's usually the app?
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.040]   No, you don't know.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.960]   It could be an API call that's not coming back and the app maybe not trapping it properly
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.600]   or maybe it's coming back with garbage that the app is not responding to.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.600]   Go ahead, Armal model.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   It's probably a combination of things.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.240]   I mean, with Mac OS 10 or Unix and stuff, you know, applications are supposed to be in
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.560]   their own space.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.440]   So you know, an application theoretically shouldn't be able to crash or reset the system.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.160]   And usually that's a sign of, you know, obviously that's an OS, that's a bug in in
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.960]   either the sky or the OS.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.560]   And then certainly I'm sure 2.0.0.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.680]   So whatever bugs there might be.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.320]   Have you heard any rumors about 2.0.1 anytime soon?
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.920]   Well, it's been floating around.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:18.880]   I mean, you know, boy genius report had posted that they found 2.0.1 version numbers in
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.320]   their web logs, you know, from from iPhones browsing their site and I actually double
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.120]   checked our logs and yeah, so they exist.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.120]   So they're in there.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.120]   They're out there.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   I guess people within Apple are testing them.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.160]   So you know, presumably it's coming soon.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   And you know, I'm not sure who knows when no one said anything and you know, a point
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.320]   0.01 upgrades probably just going to be bug fixes rather than any new features.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.640]   Well, you know, I'll take it.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.960]   August 20th though, they're releasing, you know, to 20 more countries.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.960]   So I don't know if that's going to require more carrier updates or whatnot.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.480]   So maybe that would be a last, you know, the last date we could probably see it.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   Have you had problems with yours on old?
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.600]   I've had some crashing problems, of course.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.520]   You know, but honestly, I haven't been using it like I use my old iPhone.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.240]   I've been home a lot in these last two weeks.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.160]   And you know, so I haven't been actually using the phone portion of it very much.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.760]   So you know, I can't say I, you know, from a phone perspective from even a 3G like roaming
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.640]   perspective, but definitely I've seen the application crashes.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.080]   But to give you a different perspective though, you know, because we're sort of hardcore,
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   you know, and we had the.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   We're not typical.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   Right.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.960]   And you know, I have two friends who just bought the 3G iPhone and did not have the previous
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.200]   iPhone and they're still amazed by Safari.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.760]   Like they're, you know, the one I spoke with yesterday was like, I love it.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.360]   You know, I don't even know what I did without it.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.240]   You know, it's like a browser that works.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.240]   Wow.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   Right.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.240]   Right.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.240]   And he had a trail before.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   So, you know, he's still in the honeymoon period where he's very happy about, you know, and
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.680]   most people aren't downloading 100 apps like we are perhaps.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.840]   Yeah, I'm just looking.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.840]   I probably have 40 different apps.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.160]   I'm going to bump the Scotsman here today because I, I got to say, and I really wish
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.800]   you're here because I don't want something I'm ragging him.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.680]   I am, I have not heard anything about the kind of stuff he was talking about with activation
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   problems.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680]   You know what?
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.520]   I, you know, in fact, I want to apologize because I think that what Scott was talking
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.680]   about, he was saying phones were bricked and I think it was a, there was a nomenclature
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.000]   error in that and I do wish you were here to.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.880]   It's a nomenclature error that I was making too.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.480]   They were not permanently milled.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.880]   So that was not fair to say.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.440]   They were, they hadn't been activated.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.040]   They were activation slowdowns and if you upgrade and you can't activate, you can't use
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   it.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   Not.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.680]   They had the functionality of a brick.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.760]   Yes, but soon not to be bricked.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.240]   And I, as far as I know, all, and this is where I'd like to talk to Scott, but because
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.240]   he was the one who said he had a lot of email, I will, I'm willing to bet that every one
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.640]   of those people, once it was activated, were back to normal.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   These were people who were not trading too well.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.680]   What I heard last week, Scott Warren, one of the folks who's on the show said that he
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:56.600]   was hearing from a lot of people saying that their, their phones still as of last, whatever
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.960]   Tuesday, Wednesday, still couldn't get activated.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.920]   Had you, had you been hearing anything about that?
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.840]   No, I mean, obviously on, on launch day, it was, it was, it was terrible.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.360]   No one, you know, anyone who did anything to their iPhone, upgrade firmware or get,
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.480]   got a new iPhone, couldn't activate like all, I mean, I think it was like nine p.m.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.440]   before things started shaking loose, but not, not as of Tuesday or Monday.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.440]   I hadn't heard anything like that.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.680]   He probably was seeing a backlog of mail from those days.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.840]   I think it's all better now.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.280]   Now mobile may still has problems.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.160]   In fact, you're saying you're reporting on Mac rumors that there's still a problem with
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.360]   mobile me mail.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.680]   One percent of users apparently are unable to access their mail and, you know, one percent
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.120]   is not a insignificant number.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.000]   So I definitely, it's a hundred thousand or more.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I mean, it's a lot.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.320]   And I've definitely heard from people who are complaining, you know, you know, not having
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.720]   email for four or five days is probably unforgivable, you know, in some ways.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.120]   But you know, Apple posted a brief, finally acknowledged it and said, you know, there's
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.560]   a problem with the server affecting one percent of users.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.160]   And they didn't really give a timeframe for, for, for fix.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.080]   And as of last check, there were still people commenting like as of like a couple hours
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.760]   ago that still wasn't working.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.080]   That's fairly serious, especially if you're using it for your, your work.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.760]   What kind of, what kind of physician were you, Dr. Kim?
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.760]   I was a nephrologist, which is a kidney doctor.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.400]   So guy calls you is having trouble peeing.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.600]   Would you be using the iPhone for a critical situation like that?
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.320]   Are you using some other phone just to be safe?
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.880]   I would use the iPhone.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.880]   Really?
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.880]   All right.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   So you trusted enough.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   You think it's reliable enough to receive phone calls?
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.920]   To receive important emergency phone calls from a guy.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.640]   You're, you're in related calls and you're in a urinary tract pain.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.600]   I would take my urine related calls on the right.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.440]   Well, we just wanted to clarify that you put your pee with your, never mind.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440]   Enough jokes.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.440]   You probably heard them all.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.600]   And so we're going to stop right there.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.600]   So there are some, there are some actually huge stories.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.320]   You know, Merlin and I were talking before the show about Robert Scobble's blog post
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.600]   in which he said, and I think this is really right on that tech blogs have kind of focused
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.760]   too much on business and we've lost our jo, our Jawa to geeky geekery.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.560]   And so I'm going to cut back a little bit on the business news, but there is a bid business
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.000]   story today, which is that Apple had the biggest June it's ever had that Apple sales
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.440]   are through the roof.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.360]   They had a $1 billion profit in Q3 2008.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:28.160]   They sold a gob of Mac and Tasha's, almost two and a half million Mac and Tasha's, 11
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.520]   million iPods and they're stock plummeted.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.880]   They're stock tanked.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.800]   It went, now I guess you could say it's a big sell off, but you could also say, you could
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   also say it had something to do with the fact that they warned that the summer quarter wasn't
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.880]   going to be as good.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   They expected a drop in sales coming up.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.520]   We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.040]   ship we had a great tweet yesterday quoting here.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.640]   Jesus Christ rises, announces Apple as the chosen company, stock down $30 an after-hour
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   trade.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.640]   Exactly.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.680]   But it's not the first time we've seen this.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.640]   I guess people sell on, you know, they, they, they take some profits.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.840]   I mean, it's hard to predict that I think there's similar conversation every time.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.840]   That's how it has that.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.100]   Well, and there's a lot of, I mean, there was, I have not followed this and I don't mean
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.360]   to just, you know, stick my hand in a hornet's nest, but there was also, people said they
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.680]   were very concerned about Steve's health.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.600]   And then I guess what, now from a Mac rumor standpoint, what do you know about that?
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.100]   I don't know what people, what the reaction was to, I just know what, what everyone else
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.100]   has said.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.640]   You know, and it's probably from, you know, just having a medical background, I've actually
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.680]   sort of avoided posting too many or any rumors about Steve Jobs' health, just because I,
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.240]   I do think it's sort of a private matter.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.440]   Well, Apple, is that exactly now?
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.200]   This is by the way, a little change from Apple, which probably fueled these rumors.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.920]   They said Steve's health is a private matter.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:51.840]   He serves at the pleasure of the board of directors and his health is not public.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.440]   And it's kind of ghoulish.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.160]   In a way, they're saying in the, I think they're saying we're not going to talk about this.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.160]   Right.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.440]   And I can understand why the market now would get a little, a little more skittish.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.440]   Sure.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.040]   You're familiar with the Whipple procedure, of course.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.240]   I'm familiar with what, what he had.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.320]   And, and, you know, I certainly understand obviously investors are going to be interested
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.160]   in, you know, his health because he's, he's definitely the, you know, the linchpin, the
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   cornerstone.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.600]   Although as, as we've said on the show before, they're, you know, he's done a good job of
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.800]   putting in place a transition team if need be.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.440]   He's got good people behind him.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.440]   Sure, sure.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.440]   It seems like it.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.680]   I mean, there was a New York Times piece today, which you may have seen, which was a little
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   more reassuring.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.120]   What did they say?
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.200]   They said that, that here I am spreading rumors already about his health.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:46.000]   But they said that his, that he'd had another surgery this year to address the malnutrition
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.200]   issue and that the cancer had not returned.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.200]   Excellent.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   Excellent.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.240]   From New York Times.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.240]   That's not a rumor.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.480]   When the time says that, that's, you know, they're the journal of record.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   They don't make stuff up.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.520]   Yeah, especially if it's about WMDs.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.880]   Did you see, I'm sorry, this is completely off topic.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.920]   But did you see that Barack Obama wrote a letter to the Times about his Iraq plans?
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.960]   They published it.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.200]   McCain writes a letter to them and they said, no, no, they sent it back.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.040]   They said, we need right rewrite this.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.800]   Now, yeah, huh is right.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.720]   It's like, what?
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.200]   What?
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.240]   This guy is the Republican, the nominal Republican nominee.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.880]   And you're just going to say, you know, take this back.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880]   You rethink it.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.440]   It's a little odd.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.440]   Anyway, that has nothing to do.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.440]   We don't talk politics on the show.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.720]   I just, that kind of surprised me.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.480]   It was like, what?
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.840]   So, but the New York Times, presumably, if they publish this story, they have some pretty
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.400]   good facts on it.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:52.560]   So that would make sense that he had a whipple, which can sometimes cause nutritional issues,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.560]   right?
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.720]   And that might be why he's looking so very thin and drawn and gaunt.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.840]   And maybe he's feeling better now.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.960]   You're really quiet, Arnold.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:08.560]   Like I said, I, you know, it's not, I, it sounds, it sounds like a plausible theory.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.760]   It sounds like a guilty.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.760]   I feel really next guilt.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.040]   I feel, I, I have to say, I mean, I don't know.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.640]   It's just something that's on my mind.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.040]   But I think people should be allowed to draw their own lines with what's on and off the
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.040]   table.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   Absolutely.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.840]   And I think things like, you know, you know, my president's child, you know, you're not
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.000]   allowed to make fun of her.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.040]   Like my health, we're not going to talk about that.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.760]   I think that's, well, I mean, maybe I'm being cynical or stupid, but I mean, I, I think
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.560]   that's reasonable for, for somebody to not have to talk about.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.560]   Dr. Tolbe.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.960]   You can say, I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.560]   You can't say you shouldn't talk about it.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   And I think it's not inappropriate for people like us and the press to speculate.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.760]   I think it is.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.480]   I think what you could say, and I don't know.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.040]   I haven't thought about this a lot, but I, I would be more comfortable with someone saying,
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.600]   well, tell us a little bit about the general plan.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.280]   If something were wrong, I think that's different.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   They have said that.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.520]   And they have talked about a cook and the various people they have in place.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.080]   I'd say like a distinction without a difference.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.720]   I just think people deserve the right to their own privacy.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   Oh, I know.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.000]   I agree with you 100%.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Absolutely.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   100%.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.960]   Steve, Steve has every right to be private about it, but it's natural for, especially
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:24.240]   if it seems to be affecting the market, it's natural for news sources to talk about it.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.400]   Now some say, and I, and that Jim Kramer and others have kind of pumped this up to create
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.120]   some drama, unnecessary drama.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.560]   I don't know if that's the case.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.400]   That's what Devorak believes.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:41.040]   Well, you know, I'm going to start taking a lot of my advice from Kramer and Devorak.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.880]   Devorak said this was not a story until Jim, Jim Kramer really raised it as an issue and
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.680]   CNBC followed along.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.680]   That's it, Jim, seriously.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   I mean, see somebody that people, is he like considered like a wise person about?
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   I don't know.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   Is he?
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.680]   He's an entertainer.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.680]   He's an entertainer.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   Yes, that's what I think.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.280]   So, I mean, if, you know, if, if, if, if Bozo the clown or Darth Vader or Ann Coulter
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.120]   said something, I'd take it with a grain of salt because they're, they're characters.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.120]   They're not real people.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.440]   However, you know, you got to remember the stock market is really, it's really a casino.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.720]   Especially now where you're looking for, I mean, on the one hand, I have to guess you're
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.640]   sitting there going, wow, I really do not want to screw the pooch on this.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.440]   I want to wait till the last minute before I decide to pull the plug out.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.440]   Right.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.160]   You're going to go on rumors as it lies.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   Right.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.160]   It is.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.440]   It's so, I mean, there, and there's a certain entertainment value and there's a certain,
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.680]   you know, there are some people who would like to keep this stuff churned up.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   But we're not going to do it.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.240]   We're going to move on.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.080]   I think the most interesting thing from the point of view of an enthusiast in that, in
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.600]   that financial results call was Steve saying, quote, "Several more wonderful new products
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.240]   will launch in the coming months in the Apple press release."
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:55.520]   End of September, it looks like there will be significant additions and/or changes to
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.520]   the product line.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.520]   What do you think this means, Arnold?
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.960]   Well, yeah, no, everyone picked up on that.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.920]   I mean, Apple, you know, if you listen to any of their financial reports, they always
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.640]   say, you know, we're very excited about our product line.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.960]   So that, I mean, that's normal.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.920]   That's like Jim Kramer saying, "Wow!"
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   Okay.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   Right.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.240]   You can't, they just have to say that.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   That's just sort of...
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.480]   He's downgraded it from a strong, "Wow!" just, "Wow!"
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   He's the Charlie Callis of the financial markets.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:27.800]   Oh, God, I love Charlie Callis.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.240]   I'm sorry, Arnold.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.200]   You just get used to this after a while.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   Okay.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.320]   No, but listening to it this time and I'm sure you all have listened to these before,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.480]   you know, I mean, they were very specific.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.080]   I think it was, I guess Oppenheimer, who was the lead, the guy that was talking about.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.080]   The CFO, yeah.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.080]   I can't remember the name, yeah.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.880]   So, you know, he was very specifically laid out, said, "Well, this, you know, this is
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   what Apple does.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:54.840]   We introduce a brand new, you know, basically a brand new product with new technology that,
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.640]   you know, no one else can match and offers, you know, the customer, like something that
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.200]   they've never really had before, seen before.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:07.520]   And then, you know, it's priced appropriately and then it sort of, you know, over time,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.400]   we can use economics, you know, and scale to bring it down.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.720]   And, you know, I mean, clearly they were talking about, you know, the iPod and the iPhone.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.920]   And you know, so you really make you think, well, there's something else coming down the
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.520]   line and not, you know, not just a MacBook revision, which is what everyone's expecting.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.240]   Yeah, something pretty exciting.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.560]   Let's welcome Andy Anakko in.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   He's at the Automat right now in downtown Manhattan and is joining us via Skype.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.920]   Hello, Andy.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.800]   The hard and hard our cheese sandwich.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   It's just the top.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.640]   At least 25 cents.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.640]   Yes.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.720]   Did you ever eat it, Horn and Hard Art?
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.600]   No, unfortunately, I only know it from 1950s musicals.
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.960]   When I was a kid, I remember vividly.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.960]   I was pretty young.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.840]   But I probably was six, you know, because I was born in 56.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.240]   So it's probably early 60s or late 50s.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.600]   Remember putting a quarter in a vending machine in a restaurant and the food comes out of
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   the machine.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.920]   You open the door and there it is.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.080]   And there's women on the other side putting new food in.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.080]   Very weird.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.240]   I have a friend who still will not go to a certain deli in New York.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   Hang on.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.440]   Who still will not go to a deli in New York because it replaced a Horn and Hard Art.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.480]   So, you know it's my favorite deli.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   Shocking.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.480]   Andy Anakko, welcome.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.480]   It's good to have you.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   We're sorry.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.560]   We got started without you, Andrew.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.520]   Let me introduce some of the people.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.520]   We've never had Arnold Kim on.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.920]   He is, I don't know if you know him, but he's the head guy at Mac Rumors.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.400]   And Andy, I'm sure you know, is with Chicago Sun Times and the Celestial.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   Andy.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   Hello.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.480]   And of course, Highland Man.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.480]   We're talking about the new Apple set-top box, of course.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.480]   Yes.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   We're very excited.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.720]   What we're talking about, we just talked about finished talking about the financial
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.600]   call and the press release in which Apple basically said big changes coming end of September.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.320]   We've now just begun the speculation of what it might be.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.360]   It's good that you came in, Andy, because you're the guy who has been saying, I want
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.840]   to see a tablet.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.120]   And that's exactly what the spec, some of the speculation is.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.480]   Well, that would be really, really cool.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:09.000]   I'm not guessing that's going to be, I'm not sure if there's, if I've seen enough science
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.120]   that there's going to be a real shipping tablet in September, though, I would have said that
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:19.800]   they're going to really go after these really good, really, really cheap sub $1000 notebooks.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.480]   But September would be kind of the wrong time to do that.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   You'd want to have those on the shelves by June, July, or at least make sure people know
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.040]   that they're shipping in August so that when it's time to send the kids off to school,
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.600]   they're sending them off to school with a $500 Apple notebook in their backpack.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.600]   I'm drawn a blank.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.680]   I would love to see a half a half a works late from Apple, but it could be just about anything.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   It sounds though.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.840]   I mean, the way Peter Oppenheimer's talking and the way Jobs talked in the press release,
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:53.000]   it sounds like, well, let me give you the quote because it's, I mean, it's pretty impressive
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   sounding.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.200]   Let me see if I can find it here.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.720]   I'm looking through Mac rumors of fine, fine website for this kind of thing.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.800]   Apple is busy finishing several more wonderful new products to launch in the coming months.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.960]   That sounds to me like more than just a rev on the Mac books.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.760]   Yeah, it does sound like something big, but what I'm looking for before I'm starting to
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:24.280]   believe any sort of a tablet, Mac or tablet touch device is I'm starting to look at what
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.840]   sort of software is going to be running on it.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:32.440]   So I could really believe them doing something like what they did with the Apple TV, where
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.760]   they were very much announcing it early to make a grandpa strike against anybody else
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.280]   who wanted to make a similar thing.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:44.920]   And the announcement, the information that I've seen publicly seems to say that they
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.880]   want to make sure they jump out the gate first and really just devastate the hopes and ruin
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.120]   the ruin the day of anybody who is planning anything similar to this.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.200]   I'm just not like I said, but doing a tablet is more than just putting it out there and
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.960]   hoping that software developers come.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.320]   They would have to come out the gate with lots of at least two or three really, really
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.320]   key apps.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.200]   Mac Daily News says, I don't know how reliable this is.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:12.920]   Think Mac book screen, possibly a big smaller in glass with iPhone like, but fuller featured
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.040]   multi touch gesture library, full OS 10.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.680]   This is why they bought PA semi, possibly with immersion's haptic technology.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.040]   That'd be fun.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.280]   Not loading superdrive accelerometer GPS.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:33.240]   Plus you touch a button and unfolds into the Jetsons car with a couple.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.920]   I can if I'm wrong, I like to be wrong really early.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.440]   So I'll go ahead and get this down.
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.880]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.080]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.400]   I think this is Alex's little like fantasy thing.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.920]   I don't think this is ever going to happen at some point.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.200]   I don't think it's going to happen soon.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   I was great.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:52.760]   We get to spend 10 weeks working on the song and the choreography for our BS dance.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.720]   It was BS BS BS.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   It never had a chance.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.720]   It never could have chance.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.200]   So we're doing a little dance.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.520]   Hey, the BS dance ladies and gentlemen, it's become a Mac break weekly favorite.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.480]   And we love to see Merlin and Andy and their togas doing that little thing.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.000]   Don't you think I mean, it's like they've got, I mean, they've got the iPhone and they
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   got the MacBook Air.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.760]   If you got the if you got the coin, you can buy a MacBook Air.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.800]   I think an air is really where to go.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   Don't you?
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.280]   I just don't see them adding another.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.640]   First of all, we'll see how Michael Arrington does with his with his $200.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   That's funny.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   Isn't it tech crunch?
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.400]   It's announced that they're going to do an open source open hardware tablet.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:34.440]   Open source hardware, though, writing writing software for open source software for hardware
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.640]   is really so far, that's been real fun to watch.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.800]   Imagine I'm glad my ATM runs on proprietary software.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.920]   Well, there've been a couple open moku open moku.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.920]   That's a business.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.920]   Have you seen the movies?
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   It's people using that Linux phone.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.920]   It's got really well.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.920]   It's all it's great.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:54.560]   If you hold it really close to your eye, you can almost see the keyboard.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.840]   My feeling is that making something, making really good software for a really good hardware
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.720]   device that does even a tenth of the things you just described is really, really hard.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.600]   I'm not saying it's not going to happen.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   I would love it.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.600]   I mean, keep it hard here.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   You're just breaking my game.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.360]   Although it's not going to be pretty.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.760]   Well, let's also be completely open here.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.400]   Remember that with the iPhone, they released it without any third party software.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:23.040]   If they just if they just shipped it with a core number of apps that they thought people
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.120]   would really go for enough to get this thing sold through Christmas and they said, oh,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.880]   by the way, in January, by the way, we're also announcing a brand new rev to the developer
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   kit.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.000]   Anybody wants to you can take all the skills that you've already developed in developing
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.520]   iPhone apps and now just extend them a little bit to develop this app and we'll have a
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.040]   new section of the app store open on January.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   That's possible.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.040]   I think you're absolutely.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.360]   I think you're I mean, I think this is look at Nokia's done it.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.400]   There's UMP, UMP, MPCs.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.440]   I mean, this is not a category that doesn't exist.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.720]   Well, no, if you if you if you've said from Intel is designed for stuff, if you've walked
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.160]   into Best Buy and asked for you MPC and looked at the really stunned puppy dog face looks
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.720]   on these people's faces, you know that it hasn't been done before.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.160]   I mean, these they've been announced and they've they have their fans, especially the Nokia
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.960]   tablet, but no one has the ability to do a device like this.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.040]   Like Apple has the ability to do a device like this.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.040]   I agree.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.040]   I agree.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040]   That's what we're waiting for.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.040]   All right.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.880]   Now, the whole tablet thing has been, you know, people talking about this for years.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.520]   I mean, there were about three or four years ago, there was like a buildup of rumors towards
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.520]   a tablet.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.160]   Like, I really thought actually at that time that tablet would happen.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.320]   I mean, you know, and sources like seeing that and stuff, not just, you know, Joe's blog.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.160]   But, you know, early and, you know, the Mac, the Mac Daily News post was sort of questionable.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.920]   You know, I mean, they they admitted, I think in their post that it was there.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.920]   They're not sure.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.640]   You know, I've heard this and here it is.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.360]   And it really reads just like a laundry list of like every wish, you know, anyone's ever
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.160]   had in last year.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.440]   But you know, earlier this year, oh, Grady, Jason, a Grady posted a seemingly credible
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   rumor.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.280]   And I've talked to him back and forth and he seemed he seemed confident about this that
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.360]   there would be a tablet coming later this year.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.640]   And so we would all sort of fit together.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.360]   And, you know, the question is whether Apple can take it to the level where, you know, I
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.160]   mean, there were cell phones before, but, you know, no one really imagined how good it
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.160]   could be.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.840]   And, you know, not to be, it sounded like a fanboy, but, you know, seriously, the iPhone
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.720]   when it came out, everyone, you know, I was at the keynote and, you know, everyone's mouth
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.720]   was a gate.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.040]   You know, it's like, oh, multi-touch, you know, it's amazing.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.560]   And really, you know, people are like using a browser on their cell phone, which they,
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.920]   you know, they tried before, but it didn't really work.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.760]   You know, similarly, people are obviously all the Apple fans are hoping, you know, can
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:35.840]   Apple, you know, add some credibility to the tablet form factor, which so far no one's
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.600]   been able to actually like break.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.440]   And, you know, Apple seems like they're willing to go into niche your areas, like with the
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.800]   Apple TV and even the air, you know, so they may be willing to give it a try.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.840]   Can we talk something out here?
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:53.520]   Something that I think is an interesting game to play is the, let's figure out what Apple's
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.720]   really thinking about game, where we stop looking backward and try to really look forward.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.720]   The chess game, the chess game they're playing, the strategy that they've got.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.120]   Well, I think what's interesting is I'll just toss out an observation and then an idea.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.280]   The observation is that Apple at this point so far has made a name for themselves by taking
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:16.160]   things that seem like a commodity that most people kind of written off as not being interesting
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.360]   and then figured out a way to make it into a consumer cult item.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.560]   You're talking to a personal computer or the cell phone?
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.560]   Yes, yes.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.560]   And the iPod.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   And the iPod.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:29.240]   Do you remember the, like, I among other people was like, "Hi, why would I need an iPod?"
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.080]   47-pound creative jukebox.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:37.120]   So that's one thing that all we think about is what, and historically the stuff that they've
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.440]   had the biggest hits with as a company seemed to be these things where you go, "Oh, I never
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.440]   even realized."
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.440]   They're like the Nirvana of electronics.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.360]   They figure out this thing that seems really obvious in retrospect, but this actually was
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.520]   a need for.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.040]   And then second, I just find myself going like, "How does this fit into their bigger plan?"
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.440]   I'm in granted the Apple TV.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.920]   I thought that was going to fit into their plan more than it has.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.840]   I just don't see how the tablet, to me, that's just--
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.520]   Oh, no, the tablet is perfect.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.520]   For who?
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.440]   For anybody who buys movies, anybody who buys music, anybody who wants to use an internet
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.440]   enabled appliance.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.440]   How big, though?
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.480]   If you don't want it really 12 inches, you want to kind of in between an iPhone and maybe
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.680]   a 12 inch, right?
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.520]   Yeah, I've always thought that if you look at a standard MacBook screen and cut that
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:25.160]   in half, that's about the ideal size you're looking at, like a 5x7 size screen.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.720]   I do have to point out, though, and I know what you're saying, Merlin.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.800]   Microsoft has tried this several times.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.200]   Microsoft put all of its might and power and influence behind tablets, and it didn't take
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   off.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.000]   Okay, but that doesn't even count because Microsoft is a company that likes to announce
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.480]   things and then hope that it gets interested enough to actually pursue it as a concept.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.840]   If you want to look at the difference between the way Apple does things, the way that anybody
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:54.240]   else does things, every cell phone manufacturer had a year to copy the iPhone.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.160]   Apple said, "Look, here's how to do it.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.120]   Here's the hardware go."
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.720]   And a year later, what we have are devices that have big screens that have touch screens,
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.240]   but you're still stuck with a very conventional phone where it has a certain limited set of
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.880]   apps that come out of the box.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:14.120]   If it doesn't have a really good multi-touch audio player out of the box, it's never going
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.120]   to have one.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.160]   If it doesn't have a really good multi-touch solution to outlining or any other application,
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.720]   it's never going to have one.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.120]   Whereas Apple basically had a plan that was three different levels deep, and now we're
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.320]   just on level two.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.720]   The thing I'm interested in, I hear what you're saying, and I also just want to clarify,
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.120]   I would probably really want one of these that existed.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.680]   What I'm trying to figure out is, one thing that made the, we've said this ad nauseam,
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.720]   one of the things that made the iPod such a game changer was that in addition to being
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:47.000]   really looking really cool and being easy to use, it brought Apple software onto a lot
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.960]   of people's desktop for the first time.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.280]   And I think that same thing happened with the iPhone.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:55.200]   It's bringing this whole Apple hardware and software into somebody's life for the first
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   time.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.520]   And so maybe I'm looking too much in the past, like I said I wasn't going to do, but I'm
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:06.560]   not sure what, apart from definitely selling some units, a few units, definitely the nerds,
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.560]   like, who's this going to be a huge hit with that ends up bringing them into the Apple
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.560]   world?
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   Is it students?
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.560]   Is it travelers?
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   People who travel a lot?
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.560]   Because I see both of the stuff, most of the stuff we're talking about, I see being
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.360]   answered by a laptop or an iPhone.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.680]   Did you see this would be just cannibalism?
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   Well, I've used in the past three, four weeks a lot of sub notes.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:31.840]   I'm not talking about Mac Ayer, I'm talking about the size of an EPC only with a lot more
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.360]   chops behind it.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.240]   And I do think that there are many of these devices that I've used.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.280]   I thought, you know what, if I had 600 bucks to spend on something like this, or 500 bucks
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.200]   to spend on something like this, this is exactly the sort of thing I would want.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:50.000]   If I had a choice between, if I were happy with my basic $50 flip phone and I just wanted
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.880]   something, another level up from that, when I wanted a larger internet experience, when
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.920]   I wanted a larger media experience, this would be very, very attractive.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.640]   Again, so long as Apple doesn't play it, the way that its competitors play it.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.560]   So long as they make it a unique experience, something that's not simply, hey, anybody
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.960]   could put a slap a touch screen on this device and have a device that competes with us.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.720]   No, you have to build an iPod, you have to build an iPhone.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.520]   We're going to, I have to, we're, you know, we have a hard out in about 20 minutes, so
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.080]   I want to go to our picks.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.640]   And Dr. Kim, I don't know if I told you this ahead of time, but we like to pick a favorite
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.840]   hardware or a software device each week and I'll invite you to participate, but you don't
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840]   have to.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.640]   But that's, before we do that, I do want to mention Drobo, because there's an updated
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.080]   Drobo deal, you know, we love our Drobo's.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.960]   And now Drobo has two models.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.920]   They announced the Firewire Drobo.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:48.400]   The second generation has Firewire 800, USB 2, faster speeds, quieter, cooler operation.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:53.920]   And you can get $25 off instantly on that Drobo if you use our special deal.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.920]   We'll tell you about that.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.800]   Or you can get the old Drobo, the first generation Drobo now greatly reduced in price.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:05.000]   So you get a really good deal on that and get 25, an additional $25 off on that.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.560]   So we've got two really good offers for you.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.040]   It's very easy to take advantage of these offers.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:20.120]   You just go to Drobo.com/macbreak, Drobo.com/macbreak, and you can see the special Drobo deals.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.120]   But I do like this new Drobo.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.120]   I haven't got one yet.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.880]   I'm really excited about the Firewire 800.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:29.560]   So if you want to know more and get instantly $25 off the new second generation Drobo with
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:35.080]   the Firewire 800 or $25 off the original Drobo, now at a really reduced price.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.880]   So it's really affordable.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.080]   And by the way, that's the one I'm using still.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:45.720]   I just added, I love Drobo because when you run low on space, it lets you know.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.160]   So it went yellow and I paid no attention.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.320]   Then it went red and said, you're down to 48 gigs.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.680]   You need to add more.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.680]   And I got $100 for $119.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.120]   I knew I got a 750 terabyte drive.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.120]   I put it in.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.120]   And here's the beauty of it.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.960]   You don't have to even shut the Drobo down.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.560]   You just pop out the smallest drive of the four.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.960]   There's four in there.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.520]   That turned out to be I think a 320 drive.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.720]   And I put in the 750.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.040]   It took over a night to rebuild it.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.400]   But it does it all automatically.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.400]   And boom, there you go.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.600]   Now I have a lot more space.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.840]   And I got it was such a good deal.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.840]   I got two of the 750s.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.040]   And the next time I get the orange from Drobo, I want to replace a 400 gig drive.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:26.040]   Then I'll have 200, 2, 500s, 2, 750s for a total of what is that?
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.520]   Two and a half terabytes of data.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.200]   Now some of that's reserved by the Drobo for a data redundancy.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.160]   That's one of the beauties about the Drobo.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.640]   You never risk a bit because of this data redundancy.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.640]   That's just great.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.520]   You just slap these S.A.T.A. drives in and their prices keep falling.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.880]   And I keep expanding my storage.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.560]   DROBO.com/Macbreak.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.720]   We thank them so much.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.680]   For their support of Mac Break, weekly.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.200]   Oh, Kid Doki, let's see here.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.280]   Andy, you just joined us.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.280]   Are you ready for a pick?
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:01.240]   I'm going to, well, I'm going to pick a, I didn't because I was having problems with
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.840]   a certain part of the piece of software used for voice over ID.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.080]   We call it POS, piece of Skype.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:13.040]   Well, see, I'm wondering, see, again, I know so little about product marketing.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:16.640]   I'm wondering if there was some, on some whiteboard somewhere they said, you know what?
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.920]   We have to get markets shared.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.280]   We have to get like market penetration here.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:25.360]   What if we make it just fail one out of every three times so that every podcast at least
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.800]   mentions the name of our product?
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   Maybe that's it.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   Maybe that's free advert.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.120]   You can't, you know, free to, hey, you know, it's honestly spelled the name correctly.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:36.880]   But you know, I use Skype and I have this network wouldn't run without Skype and I don't have
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.880]   those troubles.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.880]   So I don't understand it myself.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.880]   I really don't.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.360]   Well, I think this is just more, just ordinary, hey, you're using a computer.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.360]   What do you expect?
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.560]   They push, there was a, there was a, there's a brand new update today and I downloaded
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.560]   it without thinking, hey, but what about that thing?
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.320]   You absolutely have to do it 2 p.m.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.320]   So I blame myself.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   I blame myself.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.040]   I was just over anxious.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.040]   I just said, you know what?
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:04.360]   I just want this thing not to suck anymore and this is, I see the door open a crack.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.360]   This is the one.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.360]   This is the one.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.360]   We just slipped past the guards.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.640]   So I don't want to see it's so tempting.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.560]   I think all of us could make like an iPhone pick every week for the next three months
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.880]   because now we, now we have steps.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.880]   Exactly.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.480]   I mean, so I didn't, I didn't, I wasn't going to do it this time, but I'm not the solution
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:26.080]   to my Skype problems was to get out another computer, break the glass and get the, you
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.400]   know, the emergency backup computer.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.520]   So I was going to take one of the coolest apps that I've had on my iPhone.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.600]   It's a, it combines everything that's cool about the iPhone.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.840]   It's called urban spoon.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.840]   Urban spoon.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.840]   Very fun.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.840]   Very fun.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.840]   So in app.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.840]   Yes.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.280]   So let's say that you're in a familiar town or an unfamiliar town and you decide that she
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.520]   is trying to, you know, decide a place where we can all go out to eat.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.640]   Urban spoon is a slot machine for selecting restaurants.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.160]   It's the silliest thing I ever saw.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.160]   I love it though.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:03.360]   So you're a location and simply you have three reels of a slot machine near nearby areas,
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.040]   styles of cuisine and price ranges.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.000]   I just literally like a slot machine.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   So funny.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:15.040]   Like a wall pole, Asian fusion cuisine, a little bit expensive.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.680]   And then, and then it'll randomly choose one restaurant that will match those three randomly
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.680]   selected guidelines.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   Those, there's a link to it.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.520]   So you can check out the reviews, check out the, the website.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.120]   If you think that, well, you know what, I'm actually interested in fusion cuisine, but
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.840]   I don't want to, I don't want to drive that far.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.920]   And actually, I don't want to spend four dollar signs worth of money.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.520]   You can lock down the fusion cuisine part of it, have it, you know, randomized again.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:43.440]   And it's a, you're just sort of like, you know, I've, I am actually like in a place where
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.800]   I know where every single restaurant is within a 20 mile radius.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.160]   I'm actually using this just to find out what it turns up for me.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.440]   And it's, and it's free, free, free.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:50:00.320]   So, you know, to offset that $400 and $439 iPhone app that's out there, it's, it's, it's
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:04.920]   using some of the carbon units that some of these like professional sales tools are burning
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:05.920]   up.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   Right.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.440]   It's urban spoon and, and, and Merlin, it is a classic first world problem.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.080]   I don't know where we should eat.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.000]   Well, I think they should add a sixth bell for something incredibly expensive.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.920]   Actually, no, actually, no, I think you don't use a Thurston Howell voice.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:25.240]   You use the, the, the, the rough crab and voice and look, I'm going to have this machine
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.240]   choose a place at random.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.240]   No arguments.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.840]   I can't figure out what I go.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.040]   I'm going to work about, I learned about urban spoon the other night.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.120]   Somebody demanded that I use it because it was so cool.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.200]   And I really, really like it.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.280]   But I think I just, I don't disagree with you any because I really do like it, but it's
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.680]   also emblematic of a basic problem with these apps, which is that they're almost useful.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.920]   Like that's, it's so almost useful.
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   But then here's what happens.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.480]   So like in San Francisco, you know, it finds where I am, which is cool.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:58.000]   And it has my neighborhood and it has my neighborhood as part of an alphabetical list.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.560]   So okay.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:05.600]   The thing is like I live in the sunset, but I also live a West portal and I also live
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.600]   near and so on.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   And so on.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.600]   You see where I'm going with this.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.560]   It would be really cool to like make it even smarter.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.160]   And, and, and I don't know.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.460]   I mean, there's stuff like where it seems, some of the stuff seems a little bit rushed
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:18.740]   out the door with like just for the G-Wiz and I'm not against that.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.300]   Some of the stuff is really fun.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.020]   But I mean, I, the thing that's exciting to me is like these are so, and I'm sorry I'm
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:26.660]   dragging this on, but the, I think there's so much potential with this stuff.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:30.300]   And I think as people use these more stuff like urban food is going to be awesome and
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:34.180]   I'll be able to bring in a Yelp like component of going like, okay, what's open right now?
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.500]   Like stuff like that is huge.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.860]   And this is the kind of thing you can do with APIs that would make this stuff really useful,
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:42.020]   which is like what's open right now and then take, then bring an open table and go like,
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.900]   okay, what's open right now where I can get a seat?
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:45.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:49.020]   And suddenly this goes from being a toy into being like a real application that like you
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:50.820]   could use rather than just demo.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.500]   Well, and I know, I know we need to move on.
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:57.940]   I'll just say that I love the fact that both the hardware and the software development
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:04.980]   kit is provoking such creativity and developers that they get this weird idea for an app and
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.900]   they just have to write it.
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:11.820]   They're the idea of not writing this stupid little, you know, the three card Monty version
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.620]   of dining out.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:14.620]   That's just not an option.
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:15.620]   They have to do it.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.620]   It's funny.
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.820]   I just counted how many Mac apps I have on my iPhone.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.820]   I have 33 apps and we need an application manager now.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.100]   And all of them are exactly like that.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.260]   They kind of just do it, you know, it's.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.420]   I was talking to my friend, my friend Dom this morning, I'm going to be speaking at his
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:33.620]   iPhone dev camp thing at Adobe in a few weeks.
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.140]   And I was like, you know what you mean?
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:39.020]   We need expose like we need a way to show all of our screens.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.620]   I tried to, I was trying to move stuff around from one place to another.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.220]   And it's talking about a first world problem.
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.220]   That was a real.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:46.220]   Dragging those little icons.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:51.500]   Yeah, you know, I started doing is making room in the home bar, putting an icon there,
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.820]   sliding the screen I want and taking it out of there.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:55.260]   It's like a pathfinder.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.460]   You made a little drop stack.
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:57.460]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:58.460]   That's so smart.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.460]   But it's really neat.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:03.100]   If you've got an iPod touch, you need to be able to use that as a second screen.
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.100]   That's it.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   Andy, that's right.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.100]   Put your pallets.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.100]   That's your pallet.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.180]   Well, no, one for your cool system clock.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.180]   Pretty soon.
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:15.780]   Well, we'll be walking down the street holding four iPhones in our hands like this kind of
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.500]   Oh, yeah, I've got a widescreen here.
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.420]   I'm also like when I'm going to calculate what kind of tip to leave, I like to do it
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.980]   in a couple of different applications just to make sure it's.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:23.980]   And four different currencies.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:24.980]   I agree.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.980]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.380]   Sometimes I leave euros because 6.28% is really a hard calculation account.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.380]   I burn it.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.380]   You want to make sure it's the carrier.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.420]   Is that how much you tip, Andy?
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:39.140]   No, I am you have to dump soup on my head not to get 20% on me.
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:40.460]   Just just for outstanding service.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:41.460]   They get 6%.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:47.380]   If you if you date a waitress, even for like three weeks, you will know how well to tip.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:53.340]   I've been a waiter and I know that like the there's an unbelievable number of terrible
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:56.180]   tippers that are slightly offset by the people who typically.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.180]   Exactly.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.180]   That's why we have to over tip.
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.180]   You're making up for all that.
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:00.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.180]   That's that.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.180]   Oh, sorry.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:03.180]   Okay.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.180]   Good.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.180]   Good pick there.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.180]   I'm going to throw in a pick.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.180]   We're still Arnold.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.180]   I'm still giving you some time.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.180]   I'm stretching this out.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:10.180]   All right.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.180]   I got one.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.180]   Go ahead then.
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.180]   You go ahead.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.180]   Sure.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.180]   Okay.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.180]   No, I mean, it's an iPhone app, of course.
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:18.540]   I mean, you know, it's what else have been doing the last two weeks.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:22.340]   But you know, I've been actually reviewing a lot of games because I've been doing a game
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:25.780]   review site at touch arcade.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.340]   And so I've been playing a lot of games.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.620]   That's my primary focus.
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.620]   Good.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:31.620]   I want to know what the best games are because there's a lot of them.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:32.620]   There's a lot of them.
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.860]   And you know, there's definitely ones that aren't so good.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:41.140]   And I guess, you know, what surprised me is on day one was this inexpensive game.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.540]   It's $3 called Dizzy B.
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.540]   Dizzy B.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:45.540]   Oh, I'm writing this.
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.540]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.540]   D.I.ZZY BE.
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:52.860]   And it looks like it's just like an independent developer who I guess has been working on
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:56.060]   it since they announced the SDK and then, you know, managed to get it in the app store
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.300]   with day one.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.300]   And yeah, I guess what was most.
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.060]   I mean, so it's a simple game.
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:02.500]   It's an accelerometer based game.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:09.180]   It's a you have a little round B and you tilt your phone to sort of collect the little
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:13.380]   flowers and then you're also supposed to free the fruit.
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:18.340]   So it sounds very abstract, but you go and you basically it's all gravity based, you
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:22.580]   know, so you're tilting your phone to try to move the B and you have to also avoid the,
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.780]   you know, the bad guys, which are who are also gravity based.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:31.260]   So you know, you're trying to manipulate one, you know, you're not to get smushed by the
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.820]   bad guys.
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.540]   It sounds it's easier to see it.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.940]   But it's only $3.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:38.700]   It has a lot of polish to it.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:44.820]   You run it and it feels like just a really well polished game, you know, compared to a
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.500]   lot of the other stuff out there and it's only $3.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.220]   It has a lot of levels.
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.060]   It'll just provides a lot of entertainment.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.900]   And I thought it was a really good example.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.060]   Any game where you get a free the fruit, I'm 100% right.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:58.620]   I think I was just not free.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.980]   I could not because I could not walk across Chairman of Claremont Street for three hours
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.900]   because it was one of those free the fruit parades.
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.900]   I support the cause, but sometimes you just want to get to the movie theater.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:08.900]   You know what?
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:09.900]   It's a lifestyle that bothers me.
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.180]   I don't it's not the people.
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:16.700]   It just it's the fact that people are out there and they're carrying fruit.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.540]   You know, sometimes a banana, sometimes a pear.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:19.540]   You don't even know.
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:20.540]   Yes.
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:21.540]   You know, right?
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.540]   And they share fruit.
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.020]   Did you know that fruits in the Bible?
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:25.020]   None of it.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.140]   Do they have pineapples in the Bible?
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.980]   I don't think so.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:28.980]   Fail.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:29.980]   Fail.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.980]   Fail.
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:32.980]   It's an epic fail.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.980]   That it was.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.980]   That's a good.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:35.980]   That's a good.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:36.980]   Somebody's never.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.980]   Oh, are there pineapples in Joshua?
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.540]   Oh, well, because you're a pious manly.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:42.740]   Of course you know that.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:43.740]   I didn't know that.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.740]   I didn't want to embarrass you.
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.100]   They're playing up playing a pineapple, walking around playing a pineapple and the walls came
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.100]   down, right?
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.100]   Is that it?
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:54.100]   I'm just making.
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:55.100]   I don't I don't.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:57:00.380]   See, if I had one of the 32 Bible applications for the iPhone on my iPhone, I would have known
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.580]   I could have searched for pineapple and I would have known that.
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:04.580]   Hi.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.580]   Hi, boss.
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.940]   I just downloaded the entire King James Bible on my iPhone.
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:10.940]   I might be a while.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:11.940]   How much?
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.300]   Did you guys try out that that I got app?
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.300]   It's really amazing.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.980]   Works great for six days and then it takes a break.
[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:21.460]   Anyway, walk, walk, walk, walk off.
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:25.820]   So any other just, you know, you could do more than one pick Arnold and I think in the
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:29.220]   game category, I'm always interested in what's out there.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.220]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:33.660]   Well, you know, obviously honorable mention to you all heard of Aurora faint.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.100]   Oh, that was going to be my pick.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.100]   I love Aurora faint.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.100]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.100]   No, no, go ahead.
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:41.980]   I mean, it's it's another example of just sort of, you know, independent developers sort
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.340]   of, you know, making a name for themselves.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:49.300]   Free and it's better than bejeweled and it's free.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.140]   Are they going to, do you think they're going to go somewhere with that?
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:54.940]   I mean, right now it's kind of a bejeweled game, but they've added a store and you add
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:58:00.020]   and you and you kind of level up and so it kind of has this MMO feel to it.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.020]   Are they going to?
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.020]   Do you think?
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.620]   They say it's yeah, they say it's the first.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:04.620]   Oh, can you hear me?
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:10.260]   They say it's the first step in the first installment of a larger online game.
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:16.100]   So this is, I think, theoretically you build up your character in this in Aurora faint.
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:19.980]   And then later I assume they'll have other installments that, you know, you do different
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:20.980]   things with.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:21.980]   Very cool.
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.620]   So it sounds like it's a big plan.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:24.620]   There's a big plan.
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:27.780]   Graphically and musically and creatively.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:30.020]   It's one of the best apps out there and it's free.
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.540]   And the UC accelerometer very well.
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.100]   I mean, you know, that's very interesting.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:36.940]   They use it in the middle of the game.
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.780]   Oh, I haven't gotten to that part yet.
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:43.860]   If you're, when you're next time you're playing, just turn your iPhone and the rules change
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:47.260]   a little so you can do more.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.260]   That's neat.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:49.980]   That's called Aurora faint and that one's free.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:52.020]   So does he be in Aurora faint?
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:56.380]   Before we get to your pick Andy and my pick two, because now I'm going to come up, I have
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:58.500]   to have to come up with another one, but I have plenty.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.220]   As I said, 32 applications.
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:06.460]   Just mention audible.com because we have audible is, of course, one of our sponsors too.
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:11.820]   And I want to mention that they are there for you ready and waiting with a book to listen
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:12.820]   to.
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:17.020]   You know, I finally finished Neil Stevenson's Anitham and it was kind of hard for me to
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.660]   read an audio book.
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.660]   I mean, read a printed book, not an audio book.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:24.660]   I mean, a thousand pages of paper and my eyes are kind of tired.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.220]   I'm thinking, what do I do now?
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:27.220]   Oh, thank goodness.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.780]   I've got audible.com.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:33.780]   And I fired up the iPhone and I listened to some audio books and my eyes got a nice rest.
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:37.820]   There are plenty of times when you can't read, maybe you're driving, you're in the gym,
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.380]   you're working in the garden, you're just taking a walk.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:44.100]   Audible bring those books, brings those books with you in such great books, 50,000 wonderful
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:45.100]   titles.
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:49.100]   Andy, we usually get your pick, but Merlin actually has an audible pick, something you
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.660]   just read, right, Merlin?
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.660]   I'm still reading it.
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:54.700]   I'm actually, I don't know, this is channel conflict.
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:58.340]   I'm actually reading it on the Kindle, but it's a really good book and it is read by
[00:59:58.340 --> 00:59:59.340]   the author.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.940]   It is audible and I listened to it on Audible.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.940]   So I...
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:07.380]   Yeah, yeah, really interesting author and it's called On Writing and it's written by the
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.780]   novelist Stephen King.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.580]   And it's really good.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:15.180]   For somebody who's theoretically a professional writer, I'm a terrible writer.
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.620]   I've always been a terrible writer and I struggle and I fall into terrible habits.
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:25.220]   I way over use M-dashes and semicolons, everything on my side is a first draft.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:29.300]   I mean, if you read stuff I actually write in real places, it's kind of better, but
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.260]   I'm constantly struggling with that.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:35.300]   And whenever I read a writing book, there's a part of me that's looking for inspiration
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:39.940]   and there's a part of me that's looking for really just sound advice and thoughts on how
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.980]   to turn this into more of a craft, which is something I aspire to even if I don't do
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.980]   it every day.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.140]   And this is a very entertaining book that does all those things.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.780]   Starts out with really with no introduction, well, Stephen King, he loves his introductions
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.260]   and his preface is, I always jump straight to the first chapter because I think he ever
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.260]   does it a little.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.820]   But he jumps straight into telling wonderful stories about his.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:01.540]   He just opens with these great, you know, say what you will about Stephen King.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:07.340]   The guy, his ability to describe things is descriptions of things are so lively and
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.860]   you really feel like you're there and you see the people, great stories and you start
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.380]   to get the gist at the first third of the book or however long.
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.660]   It's hard to tell when you're reading on the Kindle.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:20.780]   It's just kind of him telling little stories that end up telling you a lot about him.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:27.100]   And the story about him being really poor and basically washing, taking like doing laundry,
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:32.060]   like his mom had done for a living and then finding out that like the rights to carry
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.820]   had sold for $400,000 or something.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.820]   It's really moving.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:40.000]   But then when he gets into the really the heart of the book, he talks about really how
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.660]   to tell good stories and how to develop what he calls a toolkit for doing this in a way
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.820]   that brings some craft to it.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:48.820]   And I don't know.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.300]   It's really been a very inspiring book for me.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.380]   It's made me want to really try a lot harder to be to be a good writer.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.980]   And it's just full of really entertaining stories.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:59.380]   Even if you're an aspirational writer, I think you'll really enjoy what he has to say.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.380]   Couldn't agree more.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:04.260]   I love this book and it made me stop using adverbs, which I think they can make me stop.
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.260]   No, it's hilarious.
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:06.500]   If you go back, so this inspired me.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:10.220]   I haven't read a Stephen book, King book since night shift in high school.
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.220]   It's short stories.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.220]   He's a good writer actually.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.220]   He's good.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.220]   But what's hilarious?
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.220]   Go pick up.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.220]   Carry.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:18.220]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.300]   It's been carry and the stand.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.540]   His writing gets so much better.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.340]   It's full of adverbs.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.740]   It's full of all these arabolos.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:26.740]   Quietly.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.740]   She walked up the stairs.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:28.740]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.740]   Sadly, she told her mother.
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:33.220]   I'm not against adverbs, but I think he makes a great point about trying not to...
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:37.340]   If you go actually, one point in a Japani before her life hackerties, Jean actually
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:41.620]   made, I think it was a bookmark that would go through and identify all the adverbs and
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.940]   something you just to say like, "Do you...
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.220]   Can this really be accomplished better with a verb somewhere?"
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.780]   Anyway, I actually, I got to say, thinking out loud here, but I think I'm probably going
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.220]   to do a series of posts on 43 folders about my favorite writing books.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.540]   This is definitely going to be on the list.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.940]   Stephen King's on writing.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:02.740]   He began the book before his awful accident in which he almost died, being hit by a van
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.220]   and finished it afterward.
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:05.220]   So he was a lot of...
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.220]   The story's in there.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.260]   The story's in there of that too, yeah.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:09.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.260]   Very powerful.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.900]   You don't want to hit Stephen King with a van.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.900]   Can I give you a...
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.900]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.900]   He's not going to be happy about it.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:16.900]   No.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.500]   He's not going to be in a real forgiving movie.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.500]   Two words.
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.500]   Pig blood.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.980]   Okay, that's all I have to say.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.020]   By the way, another book I want to add to your list, you've probably read it already,
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:30.100]   but one of the great writing books that just really inspired me, Bird by Bird.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.060]   And it's a great book on tape too.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:33.060]   Yep.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.060]   It's available for a call on tape.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.060]   Audio.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:36.060]   Sorry.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.700]   It's variable from audible.com, Bird by Bird, some instructions on writing and life by the
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:39.700]   great Annie Lamont.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:41.900]   That is another just truly inspiring.
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.260]   If you had to make two columns of books and you had to put it in the one column, it's
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.620]   very hard to do, but in the one column I would put books like Williams, Insers on Writing
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.940]   Well and Strunk and White and some of those books.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.020]   And then the other one, the books like Writing Down the Bones and Bird by Bird and on Writing,
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:58.140]   I would put that Bird by Bird very near the top.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.140]   They're inspirational.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.980]   They're not as instructional as say.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:01.980]   Practical too.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.980]   I mean, I refer to it a lot on 43 folders.
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:07.260]   The single, one of the single greatest things anyone has ever said about writing is her
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:11.620]   talking about she keeps a one inch square picture frame on her desk.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:14.900]   And she always tells herself, all I need to do is fill the equivalent of that picture
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:15.900]   frame.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:20.380]   And somebody who struggles with procrastination or who worries about being able to get started,
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.540]   all you need to do is fill that frame.
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.140]   And that was such inspiring advice to me.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.140]   That is good.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.140]   I like that.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.140]   I'm going to start doing that.
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:31.900]   A couple of great books there, but on Writing from the Stephen King on Writing, he reads
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.900]   it.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:33.900]   It's incredible.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.500]   Annie Lamont reads hers, Bird by Bird, so they're a couple of very good books.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.060]   Look, you get the idea.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.060]   Audible.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.340]   It's great for readers and writers and anybody who's listening.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:47.900]   If you like podcasts, you'll love audiobooks from audible.com audible.com/macbreak.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.140]   That's the site to get your free book.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.980]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac break weekly.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.500]   Andy, I'm sorry.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:58.300]   We stole your, your pick, but just save it for next week.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.300]   Okay.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.220]   Yeah, probably is a great pick.
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:07.260]   I mentioned, well, I have mentioned an iPhone game because I had a very solid Mac pick that
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.020]   I will then give tomorrow next week.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.020]   Really?
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.020]   These are all going to do iPhones?
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.820]   Well, no, because I'm not, again, I had a, I'm on my backup Mac right now.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.260]   I don't have the app in front of me and I can't really talk about it.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.260]   Okay.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.260]   No, that's good.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.660]   I have to say that I don't, I know that it's one of two, two words that's inside my head.
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:27.300]   I'm going to say the wrong one if I try to go blindly.
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.020]   I know that feeling.
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.580]   I do that all the time.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.380]   I did not start this show.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.380]   Garland did in success.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:36.380]   I don't really think this is my day to start.
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:37.380]   Garland did.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.380]   That's a good, that's a good word.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:39.380]   Good.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.740]   So what is your pick?
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:42.740]   What is your pick then?
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.060]   Oh, well, you already heard it.
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:51.180]   Remember I talked about the, that, that he said scroll, scroll, scroll, urban spoon?
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.180]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.300]   I can talk about another, I'll make, I'll happily make another pick then.
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.300]   Why did I do that?
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:58.300]   I was Merlin that was next.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.300]   So you go ahead.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.300]   Good.
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.940]   You know what, these, these iPhone apps are so small, pick two, they're small.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.940]   Okay.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:09.340]   Now, do you talk about games that really exploit the sort of platform that's on?
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:12.260]   This is the simplest damn, the simplest damn game.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:18.780]   It's a, it's a dice poker game, in which you shake the dice by simply shaking the iPhone.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:21.060]   It's like, it's, it's like Yahtzee.
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:28.060]   Okay, all you, it's, it's a, nah, this is, this is for the moment, cause it's, it's, it's,
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:32.820]   you can tell that it's an early iPhone app because it has this, has really, really easily,
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:36.780]   like isolated and easily marketable names like poker to do.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.300]   You know, it's like, no, that's, it's like.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.500]   It's something, something you'd find on a PBS.
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:46.540]   So, so just, just Google for poker, you know, global thermonuclear war to cacto.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.540]   Motion X.
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.540]   I think this is one.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.540]   Motion X poker.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:50.540]   Yes.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.540]   Thank you.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.540]   Motion, motion X poker.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.540]   It's beautifully done.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:57.220]   The dice move like based on real physics.
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.660]   The noise is great.
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:02.580]   And it's, you're essentially playing poker with, with, with five dice.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:07.820]   And you understand why you want to be in the casino business because it becomes almost
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:09.140]   a meditative act.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:13.460]   You just, you know, you shake it up, you listen for the clack, clack, clack, you wait for
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:14.460]   it to stop.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:17.940]   Then the dealer, you know, deals his and you simply select, okay, I got two kings.
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:19.220]   I'll have to keep those two jacks.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:20.220]   I'll keep those.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.220]   Shake it again.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.340]   Let's see what I get now.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:23.340]   I'm getting a 10.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.340]   It's fun.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.340]   Yeah, I get it.
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:27.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.860]   And, but again, it sounds so simple and so stupid.
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:36.380]   But again, I've downloaded about 7, 8, 9 really complicated games that look great on screen,
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.260]   but I'm just not playing them.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.260]   Rest this thing.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.260]   You know what?
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.700]   If I'm in line and I got a minute and a half to kill, I'm playing this, this, this dice
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.700]   game.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.700]   So it's, it's really good.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.180]   It's a motion expoker.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.180]   You're correct.
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.420]   That's, it's a $4.99.
[01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:53.540]   So it's not, not a nine and a nine cent game, but there's lots of quality inside this thing.
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:08:00.380]   And again, unlike the 48 level 3D canyons of doom or whatever that's coming up tomorrow,
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.440]   you know, you're not just, you're not going to sit there in your couch for three hours
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.440]   playing this.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.700]   I like casual games.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.660]   I think a phone should have casual games on them.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:12.300]   Stuff you do in the, in the dentist's waiting room, stuff like that.
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.300]   Definitely.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.300]   I like have you played, you've all played the Texas hold them.
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.140]   I think it's the most popular app right now on the, on the map.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.980]   I think that's pretty good.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:25.820]   That, because of the, this, because you know, I, when I want to show people what the, uh,
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:29.660]   I pod or the iPhone is capable of a show them that because of the video involved in
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:30.660]   it.
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:33.060]   It's such a vivid, you know, uh, experience.
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:35.460]   I mean, the guys are actually playing it.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:38.660]   Do you not like it as well as the, as your dice game?
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.940]   I have, I actually know this is, this is going to reveal a lot about me.
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:47.020]   I got so super saturated by poker in the media last year in the year before this is, this
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.020]   is Texas hold them.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.860]   It's that, that I'm just like, you know what?
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:53.260]   This is one of 41 of them and they're all going to be co-licensed with characters.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:57.380]   I'm supposed to know about because they're famous poker players, you know, but I, I just
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.940]   give it, you know, that that's too many cars to keep track of.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.860]   Give me, you know, five, six sided dice.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.860]   I can count to five.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:03.860]   That'll do it for me.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:09.060]   I like this is a very good Texas hold of implementation and I'm, it's, it's the movie makes it very
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.300]   realistic and you, you're playing against real people.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:13.780]   I mean, of course there's a lot of repetition in it.
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.780]   Let's see.
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:15.780]   I've got an ace queen of spades.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.780]   That's pretty good.
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:17.780]   I'm going to bet that one.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.780]   I'm, I'm going to go all in.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.780]   Let's just go all in on that one.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:20.780]   There we go.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:23.780]   And it's a live network.
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:25.540]   There is land play.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:29.100]   There is network play and that's, that's kind of an interesting situation.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.780]   I mean, I wonder if we're going to see that.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:36.060]   Oh, it looks like, it looks like I got a flush.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.820]   Oh man.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:39.620]   Is it my flush?
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.900]   Let's see if I won or lost.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:45.420]   I guess I'm out of the game.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.420]   Okay.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   Well, that was fun.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.260]   One hand and I'm done.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.260]   It's a casual game.
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.340]   So you're recommending the, which, which poker it's called the motion.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.340]   It's poker.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.340]   It's called motion X poker.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.740]   And before, you know, before I get all high and mighty, at some point there's going to
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:05.300]   be like a poker blog about this and I'll ruin it for this version of poker for me too.
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:10.340]   Oh, so, so, so, so, so it's not like, but again, it's, it's a simple idea with perfect
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.340]   execution.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.340]   Yeah, I looked at it.
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:15.340]   I thought it's not poker, but now that I know it's poker dice, that looks like fun.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:19.700]   Plus it, plus it's fun because as you make more money, you can get access to better tables.
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.100]   You can make bigger bets.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.420]   They, you get diffed.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:26.220]   They're like about, seems like three dozen, four dozen different kinds of dice.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.620]   And the first time that you get five of a kind, you unlock a special pair of dice.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.460]   The first time you win 10 in a row, you unlock another special pair of dice.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.260]   It's, it keeps being fun.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.260]   All right.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:43.420]   I'm going to recommend a, an application that is kind of just purely informational.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.580]   In fact, somebody in the chat room, I think, told me about it.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:46.580]   It's from Bloomberg.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.620]   Have you seen the, you know, normally I wouldn't have, I'm not interested in a stock application.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.260]   In fact, I moved the stock application way off to the side.
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.500]   You know, I created a page for unused.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.100]   And then you use, the first thing I did was move that as far away.
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:58.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.500]   But this one is kind of interesting.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:02.980]   This is, this gives you a lot more information.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:06.020]   What I'm, why I'm picking it is really because it's so beautiful.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.220]   It's just a gorgeously done application.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:12.060]   And for instance, if you rotate the phone, the graphs take up the whole screen all of
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:18.500]   a sudden and you can choose, you can use it uses the, you know, the pinches on the graphs.
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.940]   It's got business news in it.
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.780]   It's just, I mean, I'm, I have no interest in this stuff.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.260]   And yet the implementation is so good.
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:30.380]   I'm making a pick just because I think, you know, and certainly if you are following stocks,
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.700]   you're going to be very interested in this.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.940]   It's from Bloomberg uses the Bloomberg news wires.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:38.500]   It has, you know, when you're following a stock, it has stories about it.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:44.660]   It has, it has great graphing, but it's really done a nice job, I think, of using the iPhone
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:45.660]   interface.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:46.740]   I think it's just a gorgeous application.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.460]   I was very impressed by this.
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.700]   Also free.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:53.980]   So if you just want to take a look at, I think the future of inform informational apps on
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.860]   the Mac, I think this might be it.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.980]   I have to say I've been very disappointed with the news readers so far and I'm looking
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:03.900]   for something that has this kind of polish in a news reader and I'd love to have a good
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.900]   one.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.620]   Isn't that weird that you think that there, I think like three, four months ago, it came
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:13.220]   up a list of the five big absolute no brainer apps for that there was going to be a million
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.220]   of them and at least two of them were going to be great.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:19.180]   One of them would be an application that's an RSS news reader that downloads everything
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:24.140]   to your internal store so that when you are in airplane mode, you still have those hours
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.140]   and hours of reading.
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:29.620]   I have yet to find a single one that either understands what this application needs to
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.820]   do or does it barely well.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:32.820]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.820]   I was hoping that news wire would be it.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:38.180]   Still Google Reader on Safari is probably the best, but I agree with you.
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.580]   It needs to download all that stuff ahead of time.
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:41.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:42.580]   Who's left?
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.580]   Anybody not done a pick?
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:44.580]   Merlin, did you do your pick?
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:45.580]   Oh, I think you.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:46.580]   Oh, Merlin.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.580]   I'd like to.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.580]   I'm pleased to a pick.
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.660]   I'm going to go quick.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:56.540]   There's my favorite application for the trio is now a pretty good application for the iPhone,
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:00.740]   but it's to me an essential application that while I hope it improves, I think is pretty
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.580]   terrific and that's splash shopper.
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:06.660]   Back on the trio, what are you laughing at?
[01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.580]   What's funny?
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.860]   Is this a shopping list program?
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:11.860]   Yes.
[01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:12.860]   Okay.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.940]   Can I tell you why it's good?
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.100]   Does it have a tip calculator in it?
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.100]   Yeah, well, can I tell you why it's good?
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.100]   Why?
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.100]   It's really cool.
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.700]   Here's the thing.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.500]   Here's a basic cornerstone.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.500]   I hate to be the frickin GTD guy.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:32.540]   I don't like wearing that mantle, but I will toss out an element of GTD that I think is
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:35.340]   valuable, which is the idea of the ubiquitous capture.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:38.340]   As I like to summarize, the time that you tend to remember that you're out of toilet
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:43.420]   paper is not while you're in the toilet paper aisle at Safeway in fur.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.940]   And so really, I think a good shopping list application is great, but here's the problem.
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:50.100]   Like what about when you capture stuff, you get up in the morning and drink coffee and
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.140]   you realize you're out of half and half.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:56.020]   So are you going to capture that on your iPhone?
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.980]   Maybe, but it would be really nice to be able to capture that at your computer.
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.500]   Well, what splash shopper does, it does several things well.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.820]   First of all, it's ships with a whole bunch of really interesting lists in them.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:08.660]   Ideas for things like, here's books that I should get or here's music I should get or
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.980]   here's movies I should get.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:11.500]   Here's things I need to do when I travel.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.500]   I love this.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:15.740]   I have a default travel list that I use of like, remember to charge the iPod, do this
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:16.740]   thing.
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.300]   I had a hide a note for my wife somewhere.
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:21.140]   Like all this stuff that I just want to remember to do while I'm in the rush of getting ready
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.340]   to catch a plane.
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:23.940]   And you can reuse that list.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:24.940]   It's non-destructive.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.780]   And so you can start over and say, okay, mark all as needed.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:32.300]   And it was a great application for the trio and slash the Mac desktop.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.300]   And then, you know, whatever, they stopped making the desktop version.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.700]   They made it, but they never did anything to improve it.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:40.540]   It would still all like whatever weird, not cocoa.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.020]   It doesn't have services, you know, whatever we don't care.
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.420]   It's just Max, who cares?
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.220]   Well, wonder of wonders.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.020]   But now they're very interested in Apple.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:54.300]   And so they make an iPhone version of this that syncs with the desktop version, which
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.980]   I think is amazing.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.620]   So I can go in and make a list of stuff.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.940]   And so, for example, wrote two, three chicken that my family enjoys.
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:03.300]   I could get this at Costco or I could get this at Safeway or I could get this at Food
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.300]   Barbat.
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:08.340]   And for any items that I'm going to use like that, I can enter in the price.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.940]   If it's a one store I always get it from, I can enter in the aisle number.
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.060]   Personally, I think that's a little bit fussy.
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.760]   But it's a really powerful application.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:19.180]   If you really want a tricked out way you never have to think about grocery lists again.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.100]   And it's a to-do list too, it looks like.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.340]   It can be, it can be.
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:25.680]   But I'll tell you, if somebody says to me, if I'm sitting there at House of Prime Ribbon,
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:29.280]   somebody goes, oh, you should try this old BC Sarat from 2005.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.280]   Why do I remember that?
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.800]   I remember that because I wrote it down in Splashhopper.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.140]   Will I remember that tomorrow morning if I hadn't written it down?
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:35.140]   No.
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.140]   No?
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.140]   No?
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:38.140]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:39.140]   So this is great.
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.140]   And it's syncs.
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:41.140]   So when you come home, all this stuff is marked.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:42.140]   And then it's a, anyway, I just find it really helpful.
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:43.840]   It's a, it's, they also do splash data.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.920]   They do a whole bunch of different stuff.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.480]   I'm very happy to see them coming back to the max stuff and the Apple stuff.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:52.700]   I hope that they continue improving the app because I think it could use a little polish
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.000]   for the iPhone.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.800]   But it's definitely very promising and good to watch.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.800]   And I'm trying to find the price.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.800]   It's $10 for the, but now do you have to buy the desktop as well as a desktop?
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.800]   See, that's the thing.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.480]   I think you need to buy the desktop version too.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.560]   There was some deal where they were saying it's a one.
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.640]   This third page needs a little bit of tidying up.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   There's a lot here.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:15.200]   But yeah, I think there's, yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.600]   Desktop software is free to current licensees.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.080]   I think you might need to buy the desktop version.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.080]   Yeah, it looks like you have to buy it.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.080]   But anyway, and like, is this too much to pay for a to-do list app?
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.280]   Yes, if that's how you use it.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:30.480]   I've used this application with much delight for probably five years now.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.440]   So it doesn't owe me a nickel.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.240]   And yeah, I mean, is it the same thing as one of these, these doofus like un-syncing
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.240]   to-do apps?
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.080]   I mean, like why would you even bother?
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.000]   And yes, could you do this with just a note list?
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.120]   Well, you could, but you can't reuse it.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.960]   And you know, another cornerstone of GTD, an of inbox zero, is like, where does this go?
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.720]   Well, this goes into the right list.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.800]   And so Splashhopper for me is the place for any kind of ephemeral, ephemeral, I might want
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.840]   this information someday while I'm out and about stuff tends to go.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:06.880]   And that's at splashdata.com and I like it a lot.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.040]   Although I do hope they improve it.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.040]   I also like it a lot.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.240]   I wish I could, I can't figure out what the price is for the desktop, but it is.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.240]   Oh, there it is.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.240]   Thanks.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.240]   30 bucks.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.240]   Yeah, it is.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.240]   What does it do without the desktop?
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240]   Just the syncs?
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:25.280]   I think it's just, I think it's just an iPhone app then, which for most people might be enough.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.280]   Okay.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:27.280]   So what are the iPhone?
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.280]   I've got it.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.280]   Yes.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.280]   Yes.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.120]   It's 20 bucks for desktop only and then 10 bucks for the iPhone.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:39.040]   And iPod Touch software for 995 and desktop for 1995.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.040]   Right.
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.040]   You go.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040]   Sorry, Andy, what are you going to say?
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:46.240]   No, no, I'm just, I'm just saying that I've got the patient in front of me and I've still
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.200]   got like 10 bucks left of free demo money.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.600]   And if I click on buy app and it's syncs.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.400]   You know what?
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:00.000]   I will personally, I will buy you let's say six tip calculators at my own expense.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.200]   I'll have them recalibrated to 6% for you.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.200]   I'll talk to, you know what?
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.200]   I'll talk to Hockenberry.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.200]   He can probably do this.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.200]   I'll have them hacked together a 6% tip.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   Yeah, 6.28.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.720]   Got to get right.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:17.600]   Now actually, I think there are as many tip calculators as there are flashlight applications
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.600]   on the iPhone.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.840]   I love the flashlight.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.840]   I think that's hilarious.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.640]   You know, you played the game.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.000]   Have you played the game where you have to hold the button?
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   No.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.480]   It's the best.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.720]   The best game on here.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.920]   And by the way, my friend Andre Torres, Torres.org, Andre is killing with this game.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.520]   He's up to like 46 minutes.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.200]   It's a game was a big button in the middle and then you hold it as long as you can.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.200]   That's it.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.640]   Well, yeah, it's a skill.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.960]   Also also known as Chuck Norris terrorist movie kill switch.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.320]   Don't let go whatever you do.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.680]   Oh my goodness.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:55.320]   Arnold, I hope you're not too appalled by what you have just heard here today.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320]   Arnold.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.320]   Arnold.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320]   I'm still here.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.960]   I haven't been put asleep by it, but I'm so glad you could join us.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.960]   I really appreciate it.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.280]   Thanks for having me.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.280]   I enjoyed it.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.480]   We'll have you back anytime you want.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.200]   We're big fans of Mac rumor.
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.480]   Rumors.com and what's the name of the new the game site you're writing for?
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.040]   Touch arcade.com.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.560]   Is that new?
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.560]   It's pretty new.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.560]   It's been sort of slow.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.840]   You know, there were obviously that much update before the app store launched.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.720]   So we've been sort of busy the last week and a half.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:24.960]   So this is this is yours.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.120]   It's half mine, half the friends.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.120]   Excellent.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.120]   And you're going to be able to get it.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.480]   I'm going to add it to my list.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.680]   It looks really like a great place to go and a great place to find out which games are
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.760]   the ones to download for your iPhone.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.680]   Very cool.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.840]   And MacRumors.com.
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.280]   Thank you, Arnold, for joining us.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.280]   Really appreciate it.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.040]   Also want to thank Andrew and not go for stopping by.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.880]   I'm sorry you had such troubles with Skype.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:53.000]   We appreciate your barreling through those and making it to the show today.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   You know what?
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.080]   It's a long, long, hard slog through an uphill battle.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.040]   But you know, by putting the chase to the line holes and then the gain the bat off the
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.640]   shoulder, it was all worthwhile.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.640]   Am I right?
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:04.640]   Absolutely.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.080]   You came to play.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:08.480]   Never have so many done so little for so few.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.720]   You got to be in it to win it.
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.720]   Am I right?
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:11.720]   I think you're right.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.760]   And Mr. Merlin, man, he's at you look nice today.com.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.920]   That's his great roughly weekly podcast.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.000]   One of the funniest shows.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.520]   The, I'm not saying one of the funniest shows.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.760]   Oh, no, that's not necessarily.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.920]   It is absolutely true.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:24.920]   There is nothing better.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920]   And I don't just say on an iPod.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920]   I mean anywhere.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.920]   It is so good.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.960]   You and sandwich and Scott Simpson are just fantastic.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.840]   You found a groove.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.840]   I appreciate that.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840]   We got it.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840]   We got it.
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.840]   You look nice today.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:38.840]   Ringtone.

[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.840]   It goes like this.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.840]   Boop.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:44.840]   Boop.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.840]   Boop.

[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.840]   Boop.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.840]   And now it will be in your head.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.480]   It is the most annoying ringtone ever.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.480]   Clean.

[01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.480]   It broke.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   It broke.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   It broke.
