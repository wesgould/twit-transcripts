[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.900]   Who was doing earlier a dramatic reading from something? What was that?
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.380]   Wikipedia actually
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.780]   Okay
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.140]   St. Chris Wednesday speech from from
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.140]   Yeah, of course
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.940]   Again, that is a great it's a great speech and like cuz Alex started saying it as a microphone check and then someone on Twitter said
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.580]   Hey, I'm surprised you didn't do that. So well, I know I have Wikipedia
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.140]   I know I can pretend to know this one. That's the one where he's exhorting the British troops on into
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.520]   battle against the French is it and he says you will and your grandchildren you will tell them that you were here on St
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520]   Chris Wednesday. It's a wonderful speech
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.220]   Thank you for classing the joint up Andy while I was you know
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.340]   It's a lot easier to read something that's been written than to answer questions on the fly from subjects
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.460]   You barely have a grasp of yeah, so it's it's it's it's a solution at the best solution, but it did fill time
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.620]   I'm thinking that's what I should do with the radio show from now on just read Shakespeare
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.340]   Laura Mip some doors that I'm a consecutive this if you memorize Laura Mip some
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.420]   I tell me you have I used to know it like to about you know
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.620]   50 decimal places like I still I still know like so you know she me that's public space
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.580]   But it's really on wacky like I rose that's the vast the royal no, no, no, no, no good cheese
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.860]   So yes, you saw you's part of the land as you land on our own. Yeah, that's towards me
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.420]   We'll come to you smart video, but that's the language of your people
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.860]   Well, that's the Soviet national anthem
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:34.860]   Like all three verses simply as a way to mock someone at the boss computers on Sunday that I didn't like
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.260]   I was I was a teenager at a time. I'm at the time
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.540]   I'm willing to spend a lot of time learning something just to mock somebody else that I don't like I hopefully hopefully I've
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.100]   Progress this was great about being a kid. You got time to do that crap
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.400]   Alex Lindsey is here. He's from it looks like from his barn in Pittsburgh unless that's an amazing green screen
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.540]   I'm I'm in Rwanda. You're in Rwanda
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.620]   Yeah
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.620]   I'm back at the yeah
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.260]   Back at the school that is awesome
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.220]   Well, what time what time a day is it now here? Oh, it's 9 30 all right at night
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.700]   It's just still relatively. Yeah, I've had a nice full day of meetings and jattying stuff
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.500]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.480]   From a Wanda Alex Lindsey of the pixel core and from Montreal. I think
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:29.340]   Mr. Renee Richie of I'm more calm, right? Yes. I am actually in Montreal. This is not a pixel core read reconstruction
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.060]   That would be funny if we get a still of that and then you're sitting here and then you walk into the frame
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.220]   That would be funny. That would be hilarious. I mean you're still sending you still Alex can't do it
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.460]   Alex can't do it
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.420]   We could do that one show and just see how how long it takes for people to notice like I will shoot like a
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.380]   Like an empty like background plate of my background
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.540]   We then we do once sure one show we're all in front of green screens and we've got each other's backgrounds behind us
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.220]   I'm I've got the Rwanda background Renee has the twitch studio background. I
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.700]   Like it. I should warn you all somebody has put eggnog in my coffee and it's not just any any whole eggnog
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:15.420]   It's spiking for Anthony Nielsen's birthday. Happy birthday. Anthony one of our great editors Apple
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.660]   Wins the iPod anti trust trial
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.100]   Really are you cheering for that we talked about that last
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.100]   I don't know the lawsuit is over
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:36.780]   No, it's done the jury has ruled in favor of Apple today just moments ago about an hour ago the class action lawsuit
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.180]   for a class of eight million people
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.260]   The the plaintiffs which are basically lawyers and some guy they found on the street the plaintiffs
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.820]   As you may remember they had trouble getting plaintiffs for all yeah
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.020]   claimed 350 million dollars plus damages because
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.820]   Apple wouldn't let
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.380]   music from other music stores like Rhapsody or Napster on its iPod
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.180]   The jury deliberated just a few hours. It's an eight person jury up the road in Oakland
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.700]   They found that Apple's iTunes 7.0
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:18.060]   Was a genuine product 7 where what what where at 12 now just to be clear. This has been going on for 10 years
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.580]   was a genuine product improvement and
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.780]   therefore not a violation of antitrust laws and
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.700]   I don't even know why that was the issue, but that was the issue the decision was unanimous
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.840]   I think didn't it turn out that the plaintiffs hadn't actually owned an iPod at the time. Yeah, they kept losing
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.540]   Yeah, the first one bought it after the deadline the other one bought it with her husband's
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.940]   credit card and so the the law firm that her husband worked at was the actual owner so she didn't have standing
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.420]   But I think they found somebody over the weekend
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.740]   You had an iPod I think between 2006 and 2008 well
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:03.340]   I think as Apple's critics would would confirm this only shows how intimidated and threatened Apple consumers feel by this industrial
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.980]   Bahimas at needs to a corrective action that they they you know they they they suffer
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.340]   But they don't want to stick their heads above the trench. That's just where is Judge Janice CotÃ© when we need oh man
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.340]   This is a this is yes
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.380]   lawyers for
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.380]   lawyers for the lawyers for the plaintiff
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.620]   Had argued that Apple issued software
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:29.980]   Whatever the plaintiff of the week that Apple had issued software updates to cut off competitors attempts to market products compatible with Apple's iPod
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:39.340]   In fact, it's kind of sad because Steve Jobs literally a few months before his death was required to testify in this case and gave a video deposition
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.900]   Which I you know that's this guy look anyway, it was a waste of time
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.540]   They're not much a cost of spent millions of dollars
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.860]   Well, most of that money goes in the pockets of the plaintiffs lawyers Patrick Coglin and attorney for the plaintiff said oh
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.100]   Surprise they plan to appeal the decision
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.100]   We're not giving up this cash cowie. We're going all the way
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:09.580]   Potentially would have been interesting if if Apple had lost the suit because one of the claims that they were making that the suit was making was that
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:17.900]   In in at least one sense that if you sell DRM content you are you are required if you were required to make sure it's supported
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.460]   But by every single device that's out there unless you want to be slapped with an antitrust suit
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.260]   Which obviously would have been just absolutely impossible and it's just not the way that any
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.980]   DRM content store has ever operated. I mean Apple
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.300]   I mean Amazon puts makes part of its business to say that we're gonna make sure that there are book players and
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.700]   Video players for as many platforms as we can support but you can imagine them having to respond to a suit saying
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.900]   Hey, I've got a palm five and stop and my Amazon video doesn't play on it and you know
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.140]   Give me either a hundred dollar gift card or or let me have
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.900]   The grown-ups to playing on this we're also we're gonna do a little pile of lawsuit
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.900]   I'm a little sympathetic to the lawsuit because
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.540]   You remember that Apple
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.900]   Forsh you to erase your iPod if you wanted to hook it up to another iTunes that was one of the issues
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.900]   I think it's kind of silly to say it has to support other copy protection schemes. I agree with Apple. That's a yeah
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.700]   That's not that's a non-starter
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:18.860]   So the copy protection it's you will sue the right people's exactly right when I sue the record industry because that's who imposed this on Apple
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.140]   And also Apple has never blocked
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.060]   When the when the iPhone came out and the ability to run apps on an iPod touch
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.700]   Then iPad came out they didn't block any competing stores from creating their own players for their own DRM content
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.340]   So that's just bogus right the suit was originally filed in
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.540]   2005
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.820]   Unbelievable
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:48.700]   Just think yeah, they bought Apple stock in 2005 they would have had their billions yep, you know
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.580]   Oh
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.700]   We're okay, so that's done. That's that is the lead story of the day. There's a lot of other little stories including a leak
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:05.540]   That we might see new color Apple laptops this year, but first I want to play for you
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.860]   Get ready get your hankies ready the Apple
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:16.060]   But
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.980]   My extra cynical glasses for this one
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.620]   I think that's that's what Hannah Jane Parkinson writing for the Guardian did
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.260]   She just ripped into this ad let me play it for you first
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:33.100]   And then I'm gonna then I'm gonna say tell you what she said is wrong with this ad young young lady going through grandma's stuff
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.380]   You don't hearing it
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.580]   It is not let me try well, you know, it's very quiet at the beginning. I think
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.420]   Yeah, she's just going through her stuff. So there's some albums and here's a picture
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:54.940]   Wait a minute. No, it's a vinyl record grandma recorded for grandpa in 1952. Let's she has a turntable
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.300]   So you can't be here. How does she know how to operate it?
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   It's so cute grandma
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:09.780]   Recorded I love his here to stay
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.100]   Very multicultural this family by the way, I just
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.220]   I have a ramen
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.780]   Oh, there's grandma sleeping with
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:29.060]   She's using a guitar and of course an an Apple
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.940]   Macintosh laptop Christmas day
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:38.820]   Grandma comes down to breakfast. What is this on my cereal? I do at press play now first of all
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.660]   Here's problem number one grandma knows exactly how to play back the iPod
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.700]   No, that no there no seniors know how to use technology. Okay. Good. All right
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.540]   You'll get that you'll get there someday, too. Don't worry
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.500]   She puts in the earbuds and she presses play and here's what she hears
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:02.220]   And there's some pictures her dead husband
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.540]   Grandma just starts to turn up and there's
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.860]   All the to do what
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.860]   The Rockies make
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.940]   This is what I start
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:24.460]   Additional hardware needed
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:31.100]   Happy holidays from thinking if she found this record did she find my Babylon 5 Star Trek's last
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.100]   Flashbit. I hope not
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:38.660]   I think it's a good it's cute. It's a it's a it's a cute
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.620]   Traditional a tradition of Apple Christmas ads with it remembered last year. They had the yeah, the the the emo kid
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.620]   Who ended up he was actually making this really nice video?
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.900]   Yeah, I'm not crap for that and they got crap for this. I don't think they're gonna get crap for this
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:13:00.420]   This is just the Guardian really being Grinchy and I think this is a better one than last years also because it doesn't really look like an Apple
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:06.740]   Add at all and I really I really think they they really fine-tune this about the sentiment and if there's Apple logos
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.940]   They're great, but I don't think this was pretty much it
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.780]   I don't think this is designed as an ad so much as a video Christmas card of a company that has no money
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:20.020]   You know what we can we can spend money on an ad that doesn't necessarily push the button hard on our products very light touch
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.740]   You see here using an a Macbook air
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:29.820]   You see grandma up using an I think was an iPhone 6 to play it back, but it's not that you know
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:35.860]   It's not you're right you're right. It looked like one of the music memory project videos from earlier this year where they took iPods around to
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:42.020]   Metal glistutions and they had people with memory difficulties listening to them and coming alive because they remembered the music so well
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:48.500]   So here's what Hannah Jane Parkinson the Grinch that stole Apple's Christmas advert
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.060]   Didn't like about it. She said
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.900]   All she said is no doubt this is a touching effort from Apple's marketing team
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.700]   It's bound to cause a lot of tears wept into mince pies and cherry glasses
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.660]   So you can tell this is for me but but I'll admit to me feeling mildly effective
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:12.020]   But what what kind of get ready what kind of empathy voids sociopath?
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:18.460]   Ruins her grandma's Christmas by reminding her of her dead husband the love of her life who is dead
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.740]   Look how sad Valerie is
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:27.940]   tears glistening on her cheeks like little orbs of memories fragments of a life lived with Raymond second
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.780]   Let's be honest Valerie doesn't really give a crap about her god granddaughters duet
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.340]   Valerie's just straight up into the fact that Santa brought her a new iPad mini 3 because now she'll be able to watch
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.140]   RuPaul's drag race and don't tell the bride from her bed
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:46.660]   There's also the fact
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.700]   Fact it's fact it's indisputable indisputable that the granddaughter who sits
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.900]   Smuggly on the stairs in the dark at the end of the video and I'm gonna use the word lurking says Hannah
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:04.300]   In fact has the audacity to just rifle through Valerie's stuff to even stumble upon the record in the first place
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.540]   What
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:15.820]   In fact can I tell you something as an older person? I pray that my children have any interest at all any of my pictures
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.420]   Recordings I'm making movies of crap. No one's ever gonna see
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.780]   This article reads like personal damage not like insightful
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.760]   I know
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.820]   port
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.700]   For you for Hannah Jane Parkinson had a terrible childhood
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:38.200]   There's no point to this article I don't see excuse me, but Valerie isn't dead yet
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.460]   Valerie isn't Raymond have some respect one can't just rifle through a grandmother's things
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:49.740]   I really should be reading this within a posh British accent in the help of finding something special in the help of inheriting it
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.740]   No
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.700]   - Raymond I love I think she I think she was just trying to be funny. That's it's fine
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.900]   It's funny. No, it's trolling. It's it's not trolling. It's like sometimes you see well
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:05.500]   Here's a funny take on it, and I don't I don't want to I don't want to like leave but like he
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:12.980]   Infective on Hannah. It's a great look. We agree. It's a great ad. It's heartwarming. It's done with extremely light touch
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:19.820]   It's really a Christmas card from Apple with the slightest little bit of Apple in it. Yeah, and also it's it's not
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.260]   It's so hard to turn off the snark meter when you see these like holiday themed ads
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.900]   Right. I still like I still come back to this one of those mall
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:34.160]   One of those mall jewelry store commercials from I might have made you've been too serious two seasons ago
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.780]   Where they just a schmaltzy thing where they have
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.060]   I think the setup is supposed to be that you know here is
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.740]   someone who's stationed
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.740]   stationed in the Middle East and
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.620]   To he had his son like go go to Zales and buy buy a ring and give it to him
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.020]   I'm gonna have to a Merry Christmas now. I'm gonna have to ask some help from my wingman over there
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.020]   And it's like you bastard
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:04.740]   You're trying to take our our good feelings about people who are serving our country and away from home for Christmas and
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:11.540]   Trying to rip it off of these good men and women and stick it on to your stupid tacky mall jewelry screw you
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:17.140]   Now I don't think I want to get married if that means putting money into the jewelry industry every kiss
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.980]   begins with K this article if I wanted Rustin Cole to give me his analysis of Apple ads
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.980]   I'd watch food detective
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:31.140]   Oh, you know, it's it's funny. Anyway, good ad nice Christmas card from Apple and Hannah made a funny
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:38.940]   Article about it. That's and she got some traction. We played it. We read her article. So there you go the culture of pessimism wins
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.940]   Yeah, I think it's more, you know, just British people are brutally unhappy
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:51.140]   As as as as John Oliver said and that's sort of the bugle after
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:57.780]   Talking about like Britain's response to like a United States being excited about some sports event
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:03.740]   So that that's how far down we've gone as British people. We are now disgusted by the simple concept of enthusiasm
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.260]   Spend your year-round cynicism
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:15.700]   Yeah, carrying on carrying on it's just you got to let it out. You got to let it out
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.300]   You got to be upset you got a half of you dip upper limb carry on
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:27.900]   Gonna send a doctor who intervention hey, hey, hey by the way all you press people who noted that Apple had pulled Bose products from the store
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.900]   They're back so there. Uh-huh now. What do you say?
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.940]   Negotiations why negotiation successful? That's right
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.220]   Apple has added some Bose sound products back to the online store including the sound like three
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.420]   Which I love I have actually I have a sound like two. It's a Bluetooth speaker sounds great
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:55.500]   Sound like mini the quiet comfort acoustic noise canceling headphones, which I think Alex Lindsey recommended is his pick of
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:02.780]   The week we gave him a very adjacent you gave my eyes those I use those little headphones on every flight
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.940]   It is like my little savior to get me away from like it's like the old Calgon take me away
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.660]   You get on you get on the plane put those on you little switch and it goes
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:20.500]   Yeah, they're awesome low footprint. Yeah, but it doesn't they still don't have the over the ears because the spread is so big there
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.780]   I don't know why speaking of negotiations. Thank you
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:30.620]   Finally and I this doesn't affect very many people, but Roku has finally made a deal with
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.620]   Comcast we should do a show
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.380]   Just like this is why Comcast sucks
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.180]   We have material every week Leo
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.420]   Yeah, the serial
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.020]   Podcast is about and we need to pick up those those viewers and listeners are going away
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.900]   So if you had an Apple TV if you had a variety of internet connected devices
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:03.700]   You could a Chromecast fire up HBO go on those devices log into your cable account and
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:09.820]   Watch including XFINITY, but not a Roku if you log in even though Roku has HBO go and Showtime
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.380]   And if you had for instance, I don't know time Warner
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:20.580]   You could log in and use them if you had Comcast and logged in it would say sorry. We don't support
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.860]   HBO goer show time on Roku devices
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.700]   Why because Comcast cares
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:32.860]   Anyway, they thought what let's get Ryan back on the phone
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:39.900]   Anyway, they've apparently negotiated it after several months of negotiations
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.220]   I have no idea what that could have been about Comcast has finally said and it starts today
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:50.580]   You can actually Roku is finally said that you can now log into your HBO go with your Comcast account and watch
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:57.820]   Which is good because Comcast X one box still thinks I don't subscribe to showtime and HBO watch on demand
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:04.740]   So I've been using HBO go to watch on demand your long I think that I think we're gonna really I think we're gonna see this unfold
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.660]   Pretty quickly next year. So over the next 18 to 24 months. You're gonna see almost every network
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.100]   I think on you know unlatch themselves from cable and a lot of people to basically all the cart
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.260]   It's very exciting Comcast and time Warner and everyone's really worried
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.020]   But we're hearing it from all kinds of different directions of everyone's looking at how do they?
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:26.260]   You know when and when and how are they gonna launch their own their own brand in this case?
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.300]   I think it was HBO more worried about the
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:35.180]   Federal government not letting it merge with time Warner than anything else. I think they're just doing everything they can
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:40.900]   Or Comcast yeah, Comcast not HBO. They're just trying to look like the nice company, but we know it's right
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.500]   Comcast yeah
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:50.300]   HBO will be offering internet programming over the internet this spring as you probably saw this is very exciting
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:56.940]   Not clear if you'll have to log in to an existing cable account prove you subscribe on the cable
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.180]   But that's what I'm thinking they're headed to yeah
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:09.900]   Yeah, it's unclear starting your HBO be available a la carte to the 70 million households with basic cable or satellite service and
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.460]   To the 10 million households with high speed internet, but no pay TV service at all
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.420]   So that that that's this is from the la times that tells you you don't have to have a cable subscription
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.380]   You they want now now. Here's the deal. You're gonna pay 20 bucks a month
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.500]   For HBO is it worth it?
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:35.300]   Sure. Well, I yeah, how much I pay for particularly just for HBO go because you don't just get current programming
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.540]   You have access to everything that pretty much as far as I know
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.540]   Everything that they have still the rights to so they have series that have stopped airing like two years ago
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:50.260]   They have movies that aren't on like the standard cable rotation anymore. That's a that's a pretty good get I think and
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:56.020]   And one of the things I think that's gonna be really interesting is to see whether you know
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:01.940]   You're gonna see another push at CES most likely a 4k in one of the things that this starts to open up
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.940]   We know that you know Netflix is going 4k next year
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:10.860]   We you know YouTube's already 4k not streaming yet, but they're but they're but they're already playing back
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.220]   The question is is if Apple and Amazon and all the other ones are starting to go to 4k
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:23.740]   But more importantly whether these HBO CBS and other networks start to have an internet only 4k solution because it's something that the broadcast
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.580]   cable and broadcast won't be able to touch for five years and
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.900]   It's something that the you know that the all the manufacturers want to get into right now
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:35.540]   And so I think that you know it'll be really interesting to see by the middle of the year whether HBO is putting in
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.420]   You like for instance a Game of Thrones come out in 4k
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:44.660]   The amount of damage it'll do to the to the TV industry is pretty profound. I way that's the timing
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:51.380]   I think is that this spring when HBO releases Christ season. I think Amazon said something about 4k this week
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.740]   Mm-hmm
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.580]   They're all talking about it because it's you know
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:24:01.180]   This confirms the notion that Apple's gonna do a 4k Apple TV this year with an app store
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.420]   And this Apple should jump on this I'm confirming it
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:15.260]   Apple should jump on this because here's a chance now with the cable deals starting to fall apart for Apple in effect to set themselves up as a
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.840]   de facto
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.100]   television provider by having an app store and
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:24.620]   Allowing you to say for you know, I'll a cart. All right. I'm gonna buy I'll get major league baseball
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.880]   HBO and Showtime for 60 bucks a month a third of that goes to Apple
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.860]   I use the Apple TV got no cable connection just an internet connection. Isn't that
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.560]   That's my dream world deal. That's what world
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.180]   I very much want to live in I've cut the cable cord out the Apple TV
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.220]   I don't have very much programming on it and the stuff I do I buy piecemeal and it would be fantastic if they had a
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.260]   Box with a little bit more power in it, you know an Apple a 8 even a 7 chip of some sort
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:53.860]   They started experimenting with h.265 already in their video streaming technology. It'd be nice to move it over to iTunes
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:58.760]   Word is they can get maybe you know twice the size for 4k that they're getting right now for
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.240]   For 1080p content, which is still you know
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.040]   Maybe hard given the broadband distribution in the US and Canada
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.960]   But it's getting there and it would just be it would be my ideal little box
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.240]   And it would work great with all the other stuff that they're putting out
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.800]   You know you have car play you have airplay of all the technologies where it takes the the content on your device
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:22.480]   Or anything that you have with you and just puts it on any screen that you have and it seems like all the technologies are in place for that now
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.920]   So this new
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.980]   EVC high efficiency video codec or have
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:36.160]   Heff or h.265 what is the bandwidth for a good quality 4k video?
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.120]   How much do I need 10 max a second 10 see most people
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:47.160]   With cable DSL maybe not but most people with cable connections or fiber connections can eat can do 10 megabits
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.580]   Alex would know this better than me
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:55.240]   But on iTunes at least they Apple streams 1080p lower than they stream 720p because they believe it's more forgiving
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:01.720]   So the it's not double the size or anything of 720 p.m. The current belief is that h.265 or hev
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.760]   It's gonna like that they'll with the increased compression
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.320]   It does take a lot more time to render it out
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.140]   But with the increased compression that it won't be four times the size of 1080p. It'll be about twice the size
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:16.960]   Yes, yes, and that's about right and and the and the big the big thing is the big costs go to people like me who are trying to encode it
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:23.320]   So right the you know that that encode the encoders are very very expensive and very powerful to do it and well
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.980]   They're not I mean in real time. I'm looking at live streaming. Yeah, really. Yeah, but they're you know
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:38.040]   $60,000 a box so for has the cards 4k in uHD it's about 15.6 megabits per second on Netflix
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.280]   But I think but that's still probably h.264 right so maybe h. Vekko get
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.960]   Yeah, so that'll push it that'll push it back that'll push it down to what what we're seeing
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.880]   I've seen some really great 10 meg streams that are are you know in the new codec
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.640]   on 4k, you know, it looks good
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.040]   There's not a lot of blocking and artifacting it looks better than what you see in cable
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.000]   I mean, you know cable is pretty horrible
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.480]   Yeah, so it's so it's it's very very clean. It looks very good
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.960]   And I think and I think you macro blocking in solid colors things like that
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.880]   I didn't you know, I didn't see I didn't see now
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.800]   It might have been what I was looking at it had a lot of detail in it
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.680]   So there wasn't a lot of those those things there, but it did it did look very good
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:24.640]   I think that and I think that it is very important for whoever's doing the compression to 4k that they they do make sure that
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.920]   It looks good coming out of the gate and it's not horribly macro block because otherwise you're not gonna tell the difference between
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.840]   4k and 10 it's all the time and on demand and everything you know if you watch
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.480]   Scott's
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.360]   When Scott bought this years ago when he when he bought his new Scott born bought his new
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.840]   It was like back then it was like a 70 or 60 inch and he asked me what he brought me over
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.120]   Is that is apartment in San Francisco? He showed it to me and I so so does that macro blocking bother you at all?
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.080]   Oh, don't tell him about it. He'll never see it forever
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:59.080]   Long
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:08.520]   Wisconsin uses master and commander the blu ray of master and commander which starts it's such a great movie
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.960]   But it starts in a very dark and see you know, right?
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:17.280]   You're sailing ship in the eight those clouds are just killer and and you can and if there's gonna be macro blocking
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:23.760]   You will see it immediately in that. Yeah, because it's just a lot of blackness and dark and you want to see how much detail you see in there and
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.800]   How much they have crazy people at all these companies?
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.520]   We're just in charge of making sure that the transfers are good of the material that they have
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.800]   The interesting thing I saw in that press release too is that HBO is gonna let ML there's basically shutting down their own
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.720]   In-house streaming in Seattle and you're gonna have MLB stream it off for them
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.920]   So it looks like they'll be a market for companies that know how to do this dreaming. Well, that's good news Alex
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.040]   Good for me. Yeah, that's exactly what they spent HBO
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:53.280]   It's been a hundred million dollars on the Seattle operation brought in a bunch of people from Microsoft. Yeah
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:58.000]   What is the name? Breckis is gone. He quit when he heard about this MLB thing
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.280]   And if they blame that for the all the problems they had when
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:09.600]   They released true detective and Game of Thrones are boys trying to watch it and it crashed on HBO go
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.500]   and apparently for nine months he knew about a
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.400]   Major flaw a
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.680]   Bug and he just they didn't fix it and that was the bug that caused the problem
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.280]   Yeah, and it's it's hard
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.960]   I mean, you know, we just have to the scale of which a lot of these things work
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.800]   It's just it's really hard to imagine having to deal with millions of people all at one time
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.720]   Yeah, you know, I mean if we when we you know when we take down a dozen you know how to do it
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.480]   Yeah, it's just a matter of spreading spreading spreading out enough in the edge more than that
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.920]   You know, not only they serve a lot of streams, but they serve a variety of streams because they do every game
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:50.560]   At the same time so they obviously have a pretty good back end
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.120]   I've heard really good things about them. Yeah, well, I'm hoping you're your holy grail
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:03.440]   Maybe here Rene Richie. We may you know next year we may look back and say that was 2015 that was the year
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.800]   Again, if you look at the team apples assembled around the apple TV
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.320]   There's every reason to be hopeful. I can't wait to get a resume from Brian Robert CEO of Comcast for work. I cannot wait
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.160]   Send that to Leo
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:21.280]   Brian you're looking for work now. He already made his pile. You know, yeah, let's take a break come back
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.280]   We're gonna talk more about the Mac
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.720]   And the scramble for the iPad I pod classic
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.560]   But first a word from personal capital
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.720]   We you know, we talk about money a lot on this show a lot of our shows
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:43.600]   And one of the things that I think is so important is planning for your retirement
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.800]   And you may say I think most of the people watching this show are going I'm not gonna retire anytime soon
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.960]   You know it comes faster than you think and if you're doing it right
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.280]   It's gonna be a nice and easy transition and that's why I use personal capital
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.240]   I recommend you do too

[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.400]   I didn't even know about till I started using personal capital is rebalancing your investments
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.160]   So that you you are planning

[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.400]   Apple stops online sales in Russia
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.400]   Saying we can't figure out what the rubles worth
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:27.200]   Is the ruble going through extreme fluctuations right now? Yeah, the it's the it's all connected oil
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.160]   You know oil is dropping quickly and you know Venezuela is probably gonna hit the ground
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:39.240]   I ran some trouble and Russia's in pretty big trouble. It's I think it's 30 or 40% of their economy Russia's currency went down
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.720]   19% today
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:49.140]   The Canadian dollars under some pressure too. So when that happens Apple doesn't know what to charge for an iPod or an iPad
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.220]   So they basically shut down sales on the web store
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:33:00.740]   Russia even had some sort of an amnesty in place for a few if you if you if you're if you're Russian and you have been making money
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:06.440]   Outside of Russia they one of the reasons why they've been doing that is because if you bring it back into Russia
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.520]   They will just basically hammer you for it and they've been saying that we will give you an amnesty
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.800]   So if you just take the money you've been making outside of our country and just bring it back into our country
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.760]   We swear we will not nationalize it. Oh you could trust Putin you can trust Putin
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.440]   So the root the ruble
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:29.800]   According to a spokesman for Apple our online store in Russia currently unavailable while we review pricing
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.000]   We apologize to customers for any convenience Wow. I don't remember is this this
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.480]   Rwanda went through hyperinflation didn't it Alex knows in Bob way oh Zimbabwe
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.280]   Yeah, Rwanda is actually pretty pretty stable, but Zimbabwe went into hyperinflation where
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.080]   Literally lunch would be twice as much the next day, you know, I know be you know
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.400]   I think I bought one lunch for over 50 million you brought me a what a billion
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.920]   I think a hundred million I think a hundred million are a billion
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.640]   Yeah, no and they weren't even the funny thing is they weren't real launched there were they were they had expiration dates
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.560]   when you know you're in trouble when the money has expiration dates so it was
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.200]   And I'm like yeah, but then Zimbabwe just got rid of the it was all their own cash
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:14.800]   So once they got rid of their own currency went to dollars and Rand and I'm tempted to buy this actually yet
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   It's on Amazon in their holiday toilist a one hundred trillion dollar banknote from Zimbabwe
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   It's only 21.95 and Amazon Prime
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.600]   That is awesome
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:32.520]   So sad like your country's going through enough problems as it is your currency is being sold as play things for
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.300]   Wealthy your nations for children. Oh my you know
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:44.480]   I got to leave I got I got into a lot of trouble because I brought a whole bunch of Zim dollars home one time
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.800]   And and I gave them to my kids to play poker with you know
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.560]   Because it was perfect like I I raised you a hundred million and it was like a real dollar
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:35:00.280]   You know and one of my friends in Zimbabwe when he found out was mortified well some of the reviews on this are pretty negative
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:05.000]   We got a one star review saying it's just not what it used to be worth what it used to be
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:18.080]   They do not come with an authenticity certificate so just a word of warning it might be fake. I don't know
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.680]   It's worth as much or more than the original
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:28.920]   21.95 it's worth a lot. What do you think the hundred trillion dollars was worth at the worst? Yeah
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:32.480]   About ten dollars. Wow. Maybe less maybe a dollar
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.360]   It got it got pretty up. It got pretty out of control
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:40.320]   It just got to a point where it was just going up so fast that you you know and and it was it was the
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.840]   It was you could you could do a PhD on just the
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.960]   The Zim because of what's crazy is is that it it went crazy, but the people didn't go crazy
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:55.160]   So business was like you know people would just figure out how to do it every day. That's awesome. It became this this you know
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.240]   Admittedly the things in Bob lines are a fair bit cooler headed than
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.120]   Americans and so I don't know if Americans would handle it the same way, but
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:07.720]   They also had a kind of a robust barter system in place and things like that that allowed them to continue in a
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.600]   It was it was a little bit of bar it wasn't it was some barter
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:17.880]   What happened was is that there's so much money coming in so there was you know as this hall all happened, you know millions left the country and there was so much
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:24.120]   remittance coming back into the country that the reason this was happening was because people were bringing random pounds and dollars in
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:30.680]   Overwestern Union and then it kept needing to cash them and so it was it was kind of that was what was kind of driving a lot of this and so
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:36.040]   So anyway, it was it's it's it was as a fascinating time to to be there
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.640]   I'm sure for the folks in the rural area. It was not a fascinating time. It was it was
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:46.120]   Gosh for the for you know if you if you had access to us dollars either through remittance or business or you know
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:52.600]   Whatever it was it didn't really there's a lot of good things about it for for those people because you know if you had a loan in
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.000]   Zimbabwe and dollars it became worthless. So you I had a friend who spent bought a
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.120]   $60,000 house and it was worth the the loan was worthless by the time you paid $10,000
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:08.760]   There's no question this kind of hyperinflation is horrible for people and yeah, I remember you we all saw the you know the
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:15.640]   pre-world war two the why my republic people paying for stuff with wheelbarrows of cash and stuff and they just
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.960]   That led to the nazi
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.360]   Nazi takeover of Germany. So it can go it can go very badly wrong
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:28.360]   Yep, I so we wish for our compatriots. They're not compatriots. They're our friends
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:34.840]   Our fellow humans in Russia. We wish the best and hope things settle down a little bit
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:43.000]   And I'm sorry. It's it's an iPod today. Yeah, it's it's funny. How you know, you know, you know, it's a big business when you're being in great
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.920]   You know directly affected by you know world. Yeah, you know, whatever
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:52.520]   You know, so you know, the you know, the United States started fracking and then Saudi Arabia decided they want to cut them off and make it worthless to frack
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   And then oh, is that what this is all about
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.680]   It's it's a big chunk of it. So the you know the fracking
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.480]   OPEC decided not to raise oil prices
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:07.960]   Well, fracking is profitable. I see at a certain rate. Yeah, I think I believe the rate I'm not positive
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:14.040]   But I believe the rate is about sixty three dollars. So, you know, you know, you know, barrel or whatever and so
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:18.840]   Uh, so when so by pushing it below far below that it just it puts a lot
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:24.920]   It'll put a bunch of most likely a bunch of companies that are leveraged. They can't pull but they can't do it right now and so it'll put them under
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.680]   Um
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.360]   But it won't really slow things down it puts the the United States in a perfect position because they
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:37.000]   They benefit when the either way fuel goes down and they benefit when the fuel goes up. It's you know, they win they win one way or the other
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.600]   Judge did he's cote oil
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:46.280]   Don't be just don't like judge did he's good day. Do you? I like the appeals court today? I thought that was great
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.520]   What happened in appeals court? This is the
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.200]   Apple ebook thing is going on. It's in appeals
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:58.440]   Yeah, and two of the three judges were fairly critical saying that one one she applied the wrong standard and the other that
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:05.960]   Uh apple that there's argument we made that apple was trying to stop a monopoly company who was uh, basically dumping amazon
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.400]   Yeah
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.920]   So it's going to be interesting to see and the third judge didn't really go one way or the other so
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.640]   Interesting. This is the second us circuit court of appeals in New York. Of course
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.800]   Uh, no matter what happens here
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:23.080]   I'm sure apple or if apple wins the publisher the publishers will appeal or the us
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:29.960]   Actually, it's the DOJ now. We'll appeal and uh, it'll continue on but they have six months to come to a decision now
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:36.280]   So it's not a swift justice. I love it judge dentists jacobs asked department of justice lawyer
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.880]   Why is it wrong for the publishers to get together to defeat a monopolist that's using predatory pricing
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:49.080]   Why it's like mice. It's like mice getting together to fight a cat. They said it's like mice getting together to put a bell on the cat. Wow
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:52.280]   Wow
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.240]   Yeah
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.960]   That's translated this one could turn it turn around pretty quickly
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:01.240]   It's only antitrust when it doesn't improve our position, right?
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.440]   It the settlement was 450 million dollars
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:13.000]   That's the money that apple would save. Although I imagine the court cost carcase costs a lot too
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.920]   And they're double or nothing right now in there. Yeah, double or nothing if they lose they pay if they
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.480]   Can't wait to put it double or nothing
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.560]   How about three out of five?
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.840]   Yeah
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.720]   Well, because it's it's it's weighing two different kinds of monopolies
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:30.360]   It's weighing a monopoly against you know the lower consumer prices, but that's not always the best result of a monopoly
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:35.800]   Sometimes you want to increase competition. So it's it's interesting. It's interesting phase of electronic law. Wow
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:42.440]   Dozens more companies sign up for apple pay apple pay obviously a great success for apple
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.240]   On tuesday, that's today
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.120]   According to the bits blog mike isek writing in the new york times
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:53.160]   The company announced it had signed up dozens more banks retail stores and startups
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.960]   For apple pay including sundress barkley card and usa a my bank
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.760]   Uh, they say now uh apple supports cards that represent about 90 of the credit card purchase volume in the us
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.840]   td america td bank north america and commerce bank
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.320]   also
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.320]   Joining 10 others
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.400]   You know, I think the the interesting thing about this
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.280]   The way it works I think is that for a lot of the banks
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.240]   They can't be left out because what happens is as soon as you put your bank
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:26.680]   You know into your phone your chances of using all the other cars that you have drops dramatically
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.520]   I know that because I my usa a card I tried to enter it into my a wall and it said no
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.600]   And so I don't use it. I use my b of a card
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:38.200]   Right so i'm not terrified of those nothing no reason not to sign up. Let's let's face it
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.600]   And I love it that I suddenly all these nfc terminals have popped up so I can use my nfc
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.240]   Canadian credit card and all those see that's what's great about this and I think it really want to underscore this is apple pay
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.240]   Only works for apple iphone users
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.920]   However
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.880]   But it does are the fosters that yeah the tap to pace
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:42:02.040]   Ecosystem the hardware works with anything that uses nfc payments or works with google wall and everywhere almost almost all phones now have nfc built into it
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:09.400]   Most android phones not all that's still it's not a feature for budget phones
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:15.560]   Every every every every $200 with 200 with two-year contract phone pretty much has it
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.720]   Yeah, I never I only use you know and all my credit cards all my bank cards
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:24.920]   I'll have the wave chip the nfc chip in them so I can use that any place that has a regular nfc terminal
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:30.600]   You just tap the card the same way you tap your phone you do have to have a six or six plus to use apple pay on a phone
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.800]   from apple do you think in some ways that might actually
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:41.160]   Backfire a little bit on apple that people might say well, I don't want to get uh, I don't want to I'll just use my old android phone
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.280]   I want
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.880]   As the year you're proposing that someone has an iphone and an
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.640]   iPhone and we will buy an android phone instead of a new iphone if they're gonna do that they're gonna do that anyway
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.160]   Yeah, maybe yeah
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.080]   And then the watch is gonna support the nfc as well
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.640]   So you'll be out with your watch on and just tap your watch to pay actually that's so it's gonna ask me a question that I didn't know
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.080]   For certain what the answer was if you have an apple watch with nfc
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.840]   But you do not have an iphone six in your pocket does apple pay still work
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:14.920]   Does it does the secure area in these inside the the watch trump the lack of a secure zone inside the phone?
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.600]   That's interesting so you have a five s or a or some other apple
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.120]   My understanding and it could be wrong because i'm just basing off recollection is that you
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:27.400]   Authorize it once in the morning and as long as the watch doesn't leave contact with your skin stays authorized for the rest of the day
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:33.240]   That was authorized by a six only or could you authorize with a five s
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.360]   Well, it's essentially transferring it to the I believe it has to come from the font
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.520]   I'll try to find out but it is being our chaper says apple watch is supposed to work with a five s
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:47.000]   Because a five s can pre-authorize the watch even though it doesn't have nfc
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:52.760]   But the watch does so it can pre-authorize the watch and then you can use the watch even though you don't have an iphone six
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:58.360]   That's what kurtis says in our chapera if so i don't work with a five as well because it's compatible
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:05.400]   Well, i'll try to find out. Yeah, exactly that the charams seems united in their opinion that the five and five s will work
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.600]   That's see that's that's the difference between being for me
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.080]   It was like there's a big difference between my being like 90 sure and completely sure
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:18.040]   Because that's a big 10 if you're telling people that that's it was it really was one of the
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.480]   Oh, yes, I believe well, but all requires and if but the chip has
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.920]   It's not clear is it i'm gonna pretend I didn't see that question
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:31.320]   It's also it's also not worth really making an opinion until it shifts because things can and will change up until the week before it ships
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:36.520]   So like it could we saw that with some other support where it worked with a five in beta and then didn't work with a five anymore
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:43.480]   In shipping software so it's it's I hate giving people expectations that you know may or may not yeah well we can say with certainty
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.880]   Because it's here on the apple pay site at apple.com/apple pay
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:53.000]   That you will be able to use an apple watch with an iphone five s and apple pay
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.680]   Touch to pay. So does the transitive property of mathematics apply to apple pay? Yeah
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:03.160]   um, so let me see if I could find that text in here because uh
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.760]   By the way lots of new retailers including staples
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:12.600]   Uh added as well. That's kind of to me. That's more important. Okay. Here we go. And I think that here we go see this
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:17.960]   apple watch paired only with the iphone five five c five s six or six plus
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.840]   You will be able to use the watch in stores
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.720]   But not in apps
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.440]   So there's the there's on the phone. So the naps has to
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:35.560]   Ask me the phone. So there you go. Andy that answers your question right there on that grid that's from apple the company apple
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:40.440]   Uh, but the checkmark is grayed out as they'll never been colored in yet
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.720]   That's you know, and I think that one of the things that that that was um was brought up in that article was you know
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:52.120]   They're talking about at a you know when you're shopping at a um, I think the I can't reach
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.240]   Um cold state warriors or or one of the basketball teams
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.440]   You know, but you know, there's a lot of demand destruction by the line
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:04.120]   So the line is is is you know, you see a long line to get a hot dog or whatever and you just don't bother
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.280]   I'll go get it later. You're a lander magic
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:12.760]   Yeah, oh lander magic. Yeah, so the the the issue, you know, the real thing with with this is removing that friction
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.920]   And I think that this is just the beginning of removing that friction
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.240]   I mean, you know really making that easy where you're you know, we're definitely going to see where you're ordering at the seat
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:24.200]   You're ordering, you know being able to you know, and if you you know, see what's I guess I think we're going talking about
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.120]   But if you look at like um
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:31.800]   You know what's happening with united is just removing almost all the friction of interacting with the airline, you know with uh,
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.000]   You know with with the iphone
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.240]   And so I think that um, this is just part of that and reducing those lines and making it
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:41.880]   You know making it a lot faster. Alex martin's chief executive the orlando magic says quote
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.440]   One of the biggest pieces of feedback we get from our fans is that the food and beverage lines are too long
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:51.480]   It actually keeps them from going to the concession stands. They don't want to miss the action. I know that I've missed
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   Uh a whole quarter of football waiting for a hamburger
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.360]   Was pissed me off no end
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:02.600]   And the burger I never even got the eventually I just said screw it
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.120]   Keep your damn burger. Fans are fine, but basketball fans
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:11.080]   Actually, this was no actually this was an oak lene's game. It was at uh the coliseum
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.000]   And and there was the burger stand we everybody was I rate
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.800]   Furious but actually that wasn't apple pay that's because they were cooking the burgers one at a time
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:25.640]   Uh, he says this and technologies like apple pay will speed up our service
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:30.120]   Now this is an interesting quote because I don't understand what he what the this is he must mean tap and pay
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.920]   In general this and technologies like apple pay will speed up our service
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.280]   I don't know. This is the new york times article
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.040]   So other companies that accept apple pay now, uh
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:47.880]   Wind ixie and albertsons amway center. That's the home to the uralino magic
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.520]   uh staples
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:54.600]   Uh whole foods of course has been tank doing it for a while mcdonald's has been doing it for a while
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:48:01.240]   But in every case am I wrong? But in I think in every case if they take apple pay that means they'll take other tap and go solutions
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.960]   Yeah, that's been my experience
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.360]   Disney lift uber air b&b
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.440]   And by converse if if a retailer deliberately destroys nfc to stop taking apple pay you also can't use other nfc technology
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.840]   Right and that's of course was that cvs?
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:19.480]   Yeah, right aid right aid. That's that's that's gonna bite that group in the butt really hard
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:24.040]   Because they because if apple if apple pay did not come out until let's say
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.840]   February of next year
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.960]   Maybe this other payment system a currency would have a chance
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:35.240]   But they've got six months of momentum and six months of acceptance and now and now I
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:42.600]   Personally, I'm in this sort of position where i'm actually disappointed if I go to panera and like the and the managers
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:47.640]   Oh, but there's no line over there at the at that far register. It's like but the far register doesn't take apple pay
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:54.040]   I don't I don't want to pay the old fast why there's no line. Oh, yeah when the machines are down people here just walk around aimlessly
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.040]   We don't know what to do anymore
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:01.480]   Part of the reason why I wanted to buy a soda so I could tap and pay that's the whole reason why
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.920]   What and that's that's the sort of cultural thing that's happening with the next six months
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.640]   And I also think that for some of these some for some of these organizations
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.560]   It won't it will not be a big deal but or it's the coupons are more
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.440]   Important but one of the things I have to say is that I never wanted as a consumer
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:24.600]   I never want to be behind someone with a coupon and I don't care how much you know if I see coupons like sticking out of their purse
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:29.080]   I just I don't care how much the next person is because you know, it's not gonna match up
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.480]   You know, there's gonna be like five minutes of like you know half the time it costs me money because I just go here
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.480]   I mean how much is that?
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:41.560]   Yeah, and by the way the converse is not true Patrick Delahandy over here in our programmer is saying
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:46.280]   Uh that he went to the Lego store and they do have tap and pay but they don't have apple pay
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.320]   So the off opposite is not always true you
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.320]   You may have not done a deal yet with apple pay even though you have tap and go
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:59.560]   That won't be for long though. Yeah, but I can just imagine I got imagine to these stores at walmart and everything else
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:04.840]   Of people with like very inexpensive androids. They don't really know how to use trying to find the currency
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.840]   Trying to find the coupon that they saw and
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.880]   It's slow
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.600]   It's slow enough sometimes on amtrac
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.160]   Where people have people have their tickets on their phones and I turn up this I turn up the brightness to maximum
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.600]   I rest it on top of the the seatbacks of the person can use this scanner source
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:28.040]   But it takes sometimes it causes delays for me though the the absolute disconnect of the that alternative is that there is no way in hell
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:36.120]   That I want to let walmart and uh and cbs and 711 all these other stores have an app on my phone that has access to my location
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:40.280]   In my contacts even when i'm not buying something that's just right stupid
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:46.280]   That's ridiculous. There's no way i'm gonna install i'm not even gonna install it on my phone let alone install it and not use it
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.920]   Right
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.640]   So apparently scooter x in her chat room has just sold another iphone six
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.400]   Uh

[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:45.800]   Uh, they'll turn it around if you forget to wipe the data or maybe it's broken because they do buy broken iphones and ipads and you can't wipe the data
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:51.080]   They'll do that and then they'll send you a check a PayPal credit or an amazon gift card
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.960]   Which they bump 5% as uh their way of saying thank you by the way gazelle now

[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:29.000]   Of course, that's going to cost a little more, but that is essentially a brand new device or certified good
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.560]   Which might so show some gentle signs of wear
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:38.280]   But it will save you a little bit of extra money all devices of course it put through gazelle's rigorous 30-point inspection

[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:53.320]   Uh next time i'm going to gazelle that's you people often say what happens to the
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.000]   Stuff that we uh sell to gazelle they resell it sometimes on ebay
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.120]   But the best stuff they save for their store now, which is great. You can even buy a six or six plus
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.040]   In the gazelle certified gadget store
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.600]   gazellele

[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.640]   Gazelle
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:24.920]   Uh, let's see. Oh, by the way, I didn't uh, I should reopen that tab but uh analysts expect that apple pay
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.240]   Apple pay alone is going to be a 34 billion dollar business in four years
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:33.160]   And uh, so that's a this is a hefty new business for apple
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.080]   Did you see the uh info infographic on what apple makes money on
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:43.320]   Did we put that in the run down here? Yeah at the top
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:49.800]   Um, this is where business insider did this. This is where apple's money comes from and I thought this was we knew this
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.800]   But when you see it in an infographic
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.280]   So the bigger the bar
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:59.240]   The more money they get the ipod the little thin bar and they get thicker with accessories
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.920]   They make more in accessories than ipods. That's interesting than i2
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.080]   Yeah ipods is their tiniest division
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:12.440]   Then the mac only only makes two and a half billion dollars. Well, see that's the thing. These are in billions
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.440]   Exactly
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:19.480]   Yeah, I mean we're called the loser product line that generates 2.2.8 billion dollars
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   Pretty soon you're gonna add apple pay. I think to this uh, that was like when the iphone 5c was a disappointment because it was only the third
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:30.840]   Yeah, most popular phone in the world number one of course iphone and this really tells you a lot about what apple
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.160]   Uh, what apple's business is these days the iphone is so much bigger like a
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:41.080]   Four times bigger than the ipad or the i or the mac that makes it the mac goleo
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:47.000]   Huh? Look at the mac go. I mean look how the well the mac is 29 billion dollars. It's still a big business
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.320]   That's engrossing and growing this is for fiscal 2014. So this is a year
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:57.320]   Uh, yeah, I don't think apple's gonna turn their back on the mac, but uh, but you see where it's what's important
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.840]   Well and the and the revenue for the iphone I believe is almost twice google's entire revenue
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:08.760]   You're kidding. Right. Uh, I think google's revenue per year is 67 billion
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.760]   Oh, we can now according to the track if you scroll down. Yeah, holy cow
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.720]   So apple revenue total
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.360]   Stocked up against other companies
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:23.860]   Is only three ad two head walmart makes 483 billion. This is revenue not profit
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:31.140]   483 billion revenue exon 392 apple 220 but as you say the 121 and a half billion dollars
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.900]   Revenue in the iphone is actually bigger than google's total revenue
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:38.180]   By almost twice
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:41.540]   Facebook's only 11 billion god. You got to feel sorry for facebook
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:44.500]   The amazon not just office down to zero
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:53.700]   You know what you shouldn't if you only make 11.2 billion dollars a year you shouldn't be spending 22 billion dollars on the on an app
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:57.780]   You should listen to your mom and get that real estate license because it meant it's not working
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:03.860]   It was a good try but admit it's not working out. Your band is not going to make it
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:07.540]   Time to have it does it does
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:12.420]   Plan be that the this this business model of let's sell things that are really expensive
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:18.900]   Let's that's a good business. I know I know there's a lot of room and for like sub
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:25.380]   $100 sub thousand dollar laptops. Let's let other people get that. Let's sell the $1,500
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:31.620]   You know, it's fast. Let's let's not sell the tablet that cost $99 and it's good enough for almost everybody
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:38.420]   Let's sell the $500. You know, it's fascinating though. Is that didn't wasn't always that way in fact remember what we used to say
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:42.420]   Who was wallet would you rather have bill gates or steve jobs?
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:48.660]   Because microsoft would just cash it in because they would make software there was no cost to make it
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:53.540]   It was just bits and it was so it was almost all profit once you cover your rnd
[00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:57.700]   But that but even microsoft now wants to be in the hardware business
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:01.460]   I don't know but somehow something shifted it's hard. Your jobs probably had a better designed wallet
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.460]   I mean if we're talking about wallet
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:09.460]   Jobs wallet looked good. It just was a nice little stitching. Yeah, just you could only put apple bucks in it
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:12.100]   Yeah, aluminium a beautiful aluminium wallet
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:17.460]   I love that infographic and this wallet has razor sharp edges
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.780]   Yum, it's a screamer
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.620]   But you just have to hold it correctly. It won't cut you as long as you hold it correctly
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:27.060]   Now you will need special pants to fit it inside here
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.820]   But these are the best pants we think that's ever been made that's that all a joke, right?
[00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:33.380]   You know wallet 2014 is not compatible with pants
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.900]   Upgrades the pants
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:42.100]   So if apple's making so much on apple pay, what would sam sung do? Oh, yeah copy it
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.860]   Sam's
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.300]   Sam's day is in the process of launching its own
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:52.900]   Tap to pay solution, but why not right because samson can't use apple pay
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:57.460]   So they're gonna launch an apple pay competitor next year
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:03.540]   The technology would be an embarrassment. It is because it's yeah, you have to have a sad usability
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.940]   Oh, man
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:09.220]   It's a good feature for samson users. I just hope that the user experience is good
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:12.500]   I mean if there's one thing I wish that they would steal more of it's not just the trap things
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:16.580]   Not just the designs but the actual user experience just please steal as much of that as possible
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.620]   As far as I can tell you know what I'm gonna have an embarrassing admission here
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:22.260]   I have not used any of the tap to pay solutions ever
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.500]   you know
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.540]   I use
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:32.500]   Credit cards and cash pure pure cash. So I just have it's the giant stone coins. They'll yep eyelids
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:38.020]   It's a bartering system. I'm a little nervous about using it. I'm a little scared. No, I just have another question
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:44.900]   The frustrating one is atms actually, you know, if you I put the first card I put onto my phone was in was my atm card
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.100]   And you tap the pay and then it asked you to put your car your code in I'm like well
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.500]   That's not what I wanted at all, you know, so you so the credit card ones are the only ones that are really seamless
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:58.740]   They do have credit card taps a paint. Yeah, but I have to say google wallet as far as I could tell is just as easy as apple pay you
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.620]   you tap it really not really because
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:06.820]   the one the really good assets of apple pay is a touch ID
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:11.940]   Because google wallet periodically required you can you have to set a passcode for google wallet
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:18.180]   And so to authenticate that you really do have authorization to control this account occasionally you have to tap in that
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.420]   Pen so if you have to use it about a day or two
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:22.420]   Like when I when I enter the pen era
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:27.140]   I'm opening the google wall up at wall at app and tapping in the the code to make sure that I'm ready to go since it goes
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:31.460]   And so that's so that's why if you tap so if you have your google wallet out and you tap it
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.900]   Occasionally not every time it will ask for the fordage of pen
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.620]   It might open at a time
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:39.940]   You don't have to we don't have to open it ahead of time
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:44.180]   But that will save you that step the like like alks says I don't want to be the person who's holding up the line
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:49.540]   Because I have to take the I have to take my phone off of the tap to pay thing and then key something in and then put something back
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:54.740]   Pop up a pin number and say type this in well, it will but I'm saying I would rather
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:59.140]   Spend the spend that 15 seconds on my own time while I'm waiting in line
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.900]   Rather than do that when people are like waiting to get to my
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.300]   It's
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.300]   Marginally easier. It's
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.580]   Easier to press your finger to it than to go one moment, but that's pretty marginal
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:20.020]   It's not marginal. I mean would you rather just simply do something that is completely analog or do something that requires the digital parts of your brain?
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.140]   I'd run for it if something like touch ID were available
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.020]   We're getting a little lazy now, Andy. I think you
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:31.700]   Lazy we want we want something that's we want some of the fish convenience like why why are you wearing a shirt?
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:37.620]   That's comfortable rather than something that's maybe a little bit too tight and has like tags to stick in you because you have the option of not having the thing that
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.380]   That doesn't that is not pleasant
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:44.740]   Well, and the other thing is is that I now when I'm in a public place and I'm gonna put my coat in
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:50.580]   I I find it. I feel like it's insecure to put my top tip of my number in I don't want to see your pen. Yeah
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:01:00.660]   Yeah, that's definitely advantage. I should say that you can change your pen that will it's not it's not it's not your ATM card pen
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.660]   This is basically a passcode for google wallet
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.460]   So if just like a good password hygiene is always good password hygiene. I do
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.020]   I am aware of the idea that now if someone notices that I have tapped to pay
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:19.060]   Installed on this phone and active and sees me tapping in a code. They will see that well now this phone is a lot more valuable for me to steal
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:25.620]   But that would only be true if they couldn't get through to uh get get through to my my my my my my
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:30.820]   My walk screen. So but that's another reason why touch ID is such a great thing for
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:35.300]   Not just for unlocking the phone, but just for so many things across the iOS
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:40.100]   Maybe this is why samson wants to do this because they do have a fingerprint reader in the s5 and the nope for
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.380]   Oh, they just they just want to do it because they don't have it and they know that it's popular
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:48.340]   Samsung is a very very fine company. I do think that they do more than just copy apple
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:55.300]   But the thing is oftentimes their only motivation to do something is because they've seen it as a popular product or service elsewhere
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.180]   And they want it inside their portfolio too
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:04.180]   As opposed to apple and mozzarella and other companies and even microsoft where they think that this is a great idea
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:08.420]   We are going to we're going to make this such a great product and we're going to be really proud of this
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:12.500]   I rarely get that sort of feeling from anything that samson does
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.900]   Say something's actually working with lupe to do this and lupe has been around for a while and is
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.620]   Pretty popular with people who use it
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.380]   Uh because it is more it is not just tied to the phone
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.060]   um
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:27.620]   You can have a lupe fob if you wish
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:33.540]   Or if you and this works in more stores a lupe digital payment card with this with a mag strip
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:39.220]   One more card. I agree with Andy. I would like to see many more samson shaped dents in the universe. I think that would be grand
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:44.260]   At the I mean the gal you use it. What is that a good name or
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:49.220]   I I just want to see that make more of a cool stuff. Things dropped from a great height. Is that true?
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:53.460]   No, those are Nokia Nokia, no kia dents those no kia dents Mike mikr's
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:58.260]   So you see the Huawei announcement today lio now. What did Huawei announce? They had a they had a
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.500]   An honor six and now they have an honor six plus
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.140]   Oh, please
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:07.780]   Is Huawei the company where the ceo dresses just like steve jobs and eternal neck lecture
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.060]   Yeah, well hugo barra works for them from google
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:14.980]   Yeah, he was a big android guy if I had one of the great demo guys at google went to work for them
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:20.100]   Huawei does have the biggest battery of any phone and now they've announced a phone at his thinner
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.660]   Even than the iphone six
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:28.020]   Because six mega was taken six extreme was taken all the plus
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:33.780]   Yeah, she'll me is the company you're thinking of lio. I was thinking show me which is just unapologetically copying
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:40.900]   Yeah, Huawei is not no they're apologizing and it's interestingly there there's six plus like the american six plus is five and a half
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.460]   Yeah, yeah
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.460]   the what they call it the Huawei glory
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.820]   the Huawei glory six plus
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:57.220]   Uh 1080p five and a half inches. It's running its own proprietary kirin chipset, which is the name of a japanese beer
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.820]   So I don't
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:05.620]   And it's octa core four cortex a 15s four cortex a sevens a molly gpu three gigs of ram
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.260]   Yeah
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:12.980]   I don't know. I just I feel funny about buying a phone from china. Oh wait a minute. They're all from china. I never mind
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:17.460]   Two eight megapixel camera sensors at the back
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.420]   I
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:25.460]   Think it looks like an interesting phone. I just find it interesting that you know plus is suddenly the sexy name when
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:32.020]   Really was it plus? Well, yeah apple two plus plus yeah, it's a plus sized phone
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:36.660]   So you started this conversation now Alex lindsay i
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:44.020]   Phone's going to every united flight attendant. They're all getting us 23,000 of them
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.820]   Will all be carrying iphone sixes
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:52.020]   Uh, what are they doing with them to make it easier for you to do what to pay them?
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:57.780]   Well, they're talking about I believe in that article they're talking about the ability for instance for you to do some of the stuff
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:01.140]   We would do with like virgin america where instead of you could order, you know
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:04.980]   I want to gin and tonic and a and uh and the chicken wrap or whatever it is
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:09.140]   I don't have to I mean I can literally do that from my seat and when she gets there
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:12.980]   She doesn't have to figure that out. She just you know, it's already been charged. She just hands me the stuff
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:18.820]   It's and it would incredibly speed up the you know, but don't they need like a square or something to do that
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:24.820]   I mean you can you can you do tap and pay in reverse with an iphone like can somebody pay me by tapping my iphone?
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:29.540]   I you know, I don't know. I mean or a case that you do through your united app, you know, so
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.580]   But i'm wondering why they need an iphone
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:37.460]   Well, I think it's I think that they want to tie that whole ecosystem together and I you know
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:42.420]   My guess is is that the airline decided they're already doing that they had I think a couple years ago had had
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:47.300]   rolled out iPads for all the pilots and they're trying to be paperless and I think they don't want to
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:51.780]   I bet that their developers were like we just already developed everything on iOS
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.780]   We just want to keep going. You know, they don't know
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:56.660]   Delta airlines gave surface tablets to their pilots
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.020]   It was a joke on twitter that wherever their hub is like if your hub is in Seattle
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:03.140]   They went with microsoft if your hub is when they go with apple if it's somewhere else
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:07.620]   They went with samsung and in unrelated news all the delta pilots have now started to work for a united
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:12.660]   Virgil and atlantic has tested giving google glass and sony smartwatches
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:16.820]   to staff greeting business class passengers. We're one of you
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:21.300]   Um, so spring him next year
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:26.820]   Yo, yo, yo, the united attendants will have a new way to ignore you. That's good
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:32.580]   I'll be playing. I'll be playing cross-e-road. I'm just sorry. I'm playing words with friends. I can't talk right now
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.860]   mr. Baldwin sit down
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.300]   Well, I
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.740]   I think that when you when you think about how this is going to be used not only for an airline
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:43.220]   But again at a ballpark or at a restaurant
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:48.580]   You know, there's really going to get to a point where you sit down at a restaurant for instance and unless the you want to talk to the waiter
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:52.740]   You go and sit there on your iphone and order, you know what you want and then it all goes into the computer system
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:57.700]   Just like they I don't think any business in their right mind would say you have to have an iphone
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:01.060]   Oh, no, no, I don't think I think that they'll develop
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:04.900]   I'm sure that they will develop solutions for android for the consumer
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:08.980]   That's the risk to going all in on this stuff is yeah
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:12.500]   That's nice for iphone users, but what about people who don't and by the way
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:18.740]   I mean half of your customers are not iphone users the back end is just a front end that's apple the back end will probably be
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:23.300]   Through web technologies or through some form of transit will work with everybody. I mean I miss this is great
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.060]   But
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.340]   Well, there's money on the hardware as long as they buy the iphones apples happy
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:31.940]   I think apple's gonna be making the money on the transactions too though. It's come on now
[01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:35.540]   $34 billion so they're gonna make a little bit of money on that
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:38.500]   well, one of the things that you know the
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:46.260]   You know, I think that the consumer apps can be android and I think that what united is definitely decided is their internal apps are all going to be
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:50.980]   iOS that's where they they can the only way they can just bite down and say this is the way it's going to be is give everybody
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:56.340]   You know all the pilots got ipads all this all the flight attendants get you know iPhones and that way they're iOS
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:00.340]   For their front end and that makes a lot of sense if you're already happy with the platform that you're on
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:05.540]   Is just to make it all one platform. It just it doesn't matter whether it's android or or or iOS
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.260]   It's just developing for both of them all the time
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:11.620]   You know it takes up extra resources. I and I also don't know
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.460]   If half or over half of the united users are
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:20.100]   You know, it'd be interesting to see they probably have data that we don't about you know
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:24.660]   Exactly what percentage uses iphone versus android which could be effective in some of the decisions
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.940]   Did you guys see the wave of IBM apps that came out of the partnership?
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:31.860]   Because they they don't look like enterprise apps away. I used to use it. Oh really interesting
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.860]   Yeah
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:37.940]   Yesterday, yeah, and one of them is an air canada app and it looks it looks tremendous
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.780]   They have apple has a whole page up
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:43.700]   I forget what what the address is but it's something easy to look for if you go to the pr page
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.580]   There's a link to it and it shows screenshots from everyone
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.500]   I think there's a dozen apps and all of them look like you'd expect an iOS app to look like
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.500]   They're treating enterprise like humans
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:57.780]   IBM mobile first for iOS enterprise insights in the palm of your hand
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:02.100]   Well, this yeah, this is this all started with to bring your own device thing, right?
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:07.700]   Uh people are bringing the uh iOS devices in so we better make sure they work it's great for apple
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:14.020]   Nice color screams great design. Um even the website looks appily. This is an IBM website
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.980]   Yeah, the apple version is actually better because they show you all of the apps
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:20.420]   Let me see if I can find it on apple.com. I'll look for it too
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.980]   But you think that
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:27.140]   Usually you got like at best a really bad website that you could access things with right
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:30.500]   and uh
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.140]   I don't know if it's apple.com/ibm, but it's like that
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.660]   I um apple.com/ipad/business
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.500]   business
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.500]   Yeah, it's business time
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.900]   Actually, yes
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:48.820]   And then if you click on check out happening in enterprise check out there right over there. Yes
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:51.940]   The most enterprising apps ever
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:56.420]   This is uh, an air canada. I'm gorgic decay for this campaign
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.340]   Oh my
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.460]   You'll find that our apps are quite enterprising
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:10.180]   You know it would be funny if they looked like lotus notes that would be fun
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:13.700]   Like a classic romance for that. Yeah
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:20.180]   Maximize are all those horrible enterprise tools at past you plus app flight attendants have a powerful tool. See here you go
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:24.820]   To deliver a whole new level of customer service for passengers who experience delays
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.620]   With ipad in hand flight attendants can subdue and calm
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:32.020]   No
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.380]   That's good
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.860]   I think you would feel more comfortable when you if the uh, you know
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:40.500]   You went to the desk instead of them standing behind a desk they could stand next to you and they're holding their ipad
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:46.100]   And they're going like this. I think you remember before there were computers in stores and then slowly more and more stores got computers
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:50.660]   And then more more stores went online and then more and more stores got online transactions and now they're getting mobile
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:55.380]   Uh, they're just a few years behind the rest of the world, but they're making the same sort of migration that everyone else is
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:00.420]   Retail stores now have a quick easy way to streamline order fulfillment with the pick and pack app
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:05.620]   I like the name pick and pack now. Can I go to the app store and just download these and play with them? No
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.260]   No, these are all enterprise distributed apps. Right
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:13.860]   Too bad to be fun. Oh insurance retaining customers was never this easy
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:19.860]   Telco delivering great service all day long
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.660]   I guess Verizon's not gonna use that one
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:26.900]   Government law enforcement and social work get mobilized by innovation
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:32.980]   Look at that backup is on the way tasty tasty innovation. It's like uber for cops
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:36.900]   Bankroll that leo that's a pretty
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.460]   I need a cop now
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:44.580]   Incident aware app police officers can know each other's whereabouts with greater insights in emergency situations
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.660]   Wow
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.140]   Hey, if anybody's watching and uses these
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:54.660]   Let us know give us an email and make a youtube video. I'd love to see what your
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:12:00.660]   Experiences been with this stuff. These are the first of many. I'm sure ibm apps designed for iOS
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:04.500]   Neat
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:09.620]   At least there's some uh issue from this particular ibm apple union
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.980]   Remember the talagent in the stillborn pink
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:17.060]   Well, yeah, you can tell there's some guys from the hi department sort of helping out making them look like this
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.860]   I don't think this is you know what ibm would brew up on their own new
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:28.020]   No, this is really interesting. I wonder what I'd be particularly interested in if any law enforcement jurisdictions are using these
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:30.900]   I'd love to see that in in action
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.700]   next on cops
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.860]   bad boys bad boys
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:38.260]   Got another phone is going for your iPhone
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.220]   apple now requires cases
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:44.500]   protect devices from one meter drops
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:53.620]   So if you want a made for iphone k if you buy a made for iphone case you can drop your phone from a meter
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:56.580]   Which for those of us in the us is 3.2 feet
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:01.220]   Exactly and
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:06.100]   They're restricting some materials for environmental reasons you may not use
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.820]   formaldehyde
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:15.060]   Endangered species pfos pfoa pbde pbb or phthalates
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:18.180]   In your in your cases, so knock it off
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:22.500]   Thalates are banned
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:28.660]   How about flubber can you still make you can make it with flubber if you want to make a light case
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:32.740]   Makes me also really helps with the whole one meter requirement
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:40.420]   Never touches the ground. I want a case where I just it just floats. I dropped the phone on up. Tanium. The unobtainium. Tanium
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:46.660]   Apple reverse reverses courses on transmit. We talked about panic software and transmit
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:51.620]   Uh, it was it had a send to button in the notification center apple said
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:58.260]   But they've they almost instantly after we talked about it changed their mind
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:04.180]   Which just underscores what you were saying rene which is they've got to come up with some consistency here's two controls
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:10.260]   It's an iOS the original the original thing that they had was you couldn't upload files unless your app created them or edited them
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:14.100]   Because they wanted to make sure that the app had ownership because they take the security and sandboxing model
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:18.020]   Seriously, and they didn't want for example for to get abused like some developer to make a fake app
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.540]   They just takes all your files and uploads it to their to some arbor trail location
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:25.300]   But it turns out panic had a really good use for it, you know, sort of like an FTP client
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:30.180]   And then they have to reconsider it's really similar to when they said you're not a lot making fun of political figures
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:33.780]   And then some guy goes, uh, I'm an editorial cartoonist and like oh, okay. Wait a minute
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.100]   so they can come up with these laws that sort of
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:38.900]   Have some good intentions, but then
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:42.500]   Uh, something what they call a quote unquote unforeseen happens and they have to reevaluate them
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.700]   Yeah, but it's it's a process and we're getting good results with it so far
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:49.700]   I mean, it's a horrible ugly process, but we're getting p-calc and we're getting transmittal right
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.940]   Well, yeah
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:54.660]   They need I think you're right. They need a vice president of app store
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:15:01.700]   It would be nice rene richie wrote a great article at i'm more apple's hour of code workshops to like kids of all ages
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:08.340]   The hour what is the hour of code rene? So this is a great thing. It's like and I just want to credit srenity called all the photos
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.340]   She did a fantastic job. Oh, these are great
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:16.980]   Um, yeah, so the hour of code is from code.org and a lot of companies participated in apple's method of participating was to host
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:23.620]   Uh about three three sessions at each retail store last thursday and you could go in it was for kids k to 12
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:28.900]   You just made a reservation and you went in and they sat you around the big table and they used examples from
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:34.900]   Angry birds plants versus zombies and other popular games to teach kids the basics of code
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:41.140]   So you'd be given a little problem and you'd be able to drag and drop things that were like loops or things that were like basic instructions
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:46.980]   And when you got them right it would solve that problem and then you'd be shown a video of bill gates or of mark succor berg
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:52.500]   Or of some other really famous program or telling you about what you know what you'd use to solve it like bill gates explain
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.220]   The loops and it was fantastic. They had about
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:59.220]   Uh for about they had about four apple specialists for eight kids
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.580]   So they got a lot of attention
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:06.180]   They were all given apple headsets to keep so they could listen to the videos without having to worry about the noise in the stores and everything
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:12.900]   And they came around the parents could get involved if they wanted to and they did three sessions in a row and the bigger flagship stores had developers
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:18.260]   Come in and give talks as well so that kids could get you know some some actual people to communicate with as well
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.500]   And I took my six-year-old and nine-year-old
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:27.940]   Godchildren there and they they loved it and at the very end I said so do you want to make video games and the nine-year-old said only for my entire life
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.460]   I
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:33.940]   Like the reaction that you quote in the article that one kid said why couldn't it be two hours of code?
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:40.660]   Here's bill. I mean, here's bill bill explain bill by the way created microsoft. He's explaining loops here. Here's bill x
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:47.700]   Oh, you don't hear it. Is that me? Yes before you go here. Let's start over people make decisions every day
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:56.340]   uh for example before you go outside you kind of have an if statement that says if it's raining then I need to get my jacket and
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:02.700]   Computers are amazing once you think girls making this up as he goes along that they can reliably
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:07.300]   Execute those things at unbelievable speed can probably and so
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:17.220]   Really is a little bit of math and some if statements where the decision gets daddy. Who's that old man?
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.100]   Puzzle the if block
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:23.460]   Anyway, that's kind of cool. That's kind of cool
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:27.940]   And the plants versus zombies people work with these uh, these uh
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:31.780]   Yeah, and if you go to code.org you can actually do all these at home
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.380]   You can do it on the website. You can save your progress. They have all the videos online
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:39.940]   So if you couldn't get to an apple store, uh, itunes also has a bunch of content up that they're linking to
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:40.980]   um
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:45.460]   You know podcasts and books and things like that and it's really great code
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:49.540]   Dot org if you want to mark suck your bird that does not look any bit different
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:54.820]   He's exactly like his high school picture. He could actually attend these sessions. He's like here's older
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:59.620]   That's right. He basically is kind of that's kind of unfair for the for the other ceos really
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.020]   I know who mark is but who's this bill guy?
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.580]   I love it
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.980]   Hour of code. I think that's great. Yeah. Yeah
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.540]   every member children
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.620]   Sandboxing is very very important
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:18.260]   As worth pointing out that's what all good software programmers do they ask the manufacturer
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.140]   What apis can I use and how can I use them?
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:24.340]   They also it's worth pointing out they also have field trips for schools
[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:29.700]   You can sign up on the apple retail pages and they have a summer camp and they also show kids how to make videos or how to make ebooks
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:34.420]   And yeah, there's a lot of resources for children there. Let's take a break when we come back our picks of the week
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:37.620]   Ani and naka rene richy alix lensier here the core group
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:43.780]   Of mac break weekly your picks gentlemen start your engines first though a word
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:48.340]   From fresh books nice canadian company they're nice
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:53.620]   They I discovered them actually in canada because I was going to toronto one week a month and uh,
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:55.620]   I had to build rogers for the
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:58.660]   The call for helps we did there and I was doing it in microsoft word
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:03.300]   And I remember just complaining no end to amber macarthur and she said hey
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:07.460]   Why you should try this new thing they just started in 2004 called fresh books
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.380]   I did I started doing all my invoicing from fresh books and man
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:16.180]   It changed my life first of all a lot easier to create an invoice also a lot faster to get paid
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:20.900]   They say on average fresh books customers get paid an average of five days faster
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:24.020]   And that's because there's a button on the invoice. It says pay me now
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:28.420]   Turns out clients aren't adverse to paying you they're just like you they put it off
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:34.740]   So make it easy. They pay mark quickly now fresh books has award-winning mobile apps that let you do everything
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.460]   from your ios device
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:42.660]   Also track hours get that right into the the bill the invoice
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:47.220]   Also keep track of expenses. You can snap photos of receipts right from your phone
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:51.460]   Automated late payment reminders meaning that you don't have to ever worry about
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:56.900]   Those those kind of tense awkward calls and emails to late paying clients
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:02.500]   You get great financial reports that helps you do better in your business and helps your account and come tax time

[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:11.140]   Start using fresh books connect fresh books and third-party apps
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.420]   like chrono mate
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:22.020]   To make it much easier. They have an open api too. So there are many developers now integrating with the fresh books platform amber macarthur
[01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:25.220]   Of bnn's app central says
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:29.620]   Fresh books she's still using it fresh books mobile allows me to quickly send invoices
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:33.540]   And check in on my business no matter where I am you will love fresh books
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:37.460]   We've got a 30-day trial for you right now fresh books dot com slash mac break
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.180]   It's accounting for the non-accountant
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:47.860]   But you know what you got to do it. So make it easy on yourself fresh books dot com slash mac break all we ask if you don't mind
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:54.500]   Uh where they have that little field that says how do you hear about it? Just mention mac break weekly. I mean nice
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:58.100]   fresh books dot com slash
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:01.620]   Mac break Alex lensy is in rowanda
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.420]   apparently five minutes from hotel rowanda
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:11.700]   Uh, yeah, it's right down the street. You said that it's not a good time to walk though because not it's a very safe street
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:15.060]   Actually, um through here and rowanda is actually very safe itself
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.180]   Uh, but the bats um bats they drop
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:21.140]   Safe except for the bats the bats
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:23.780]   The bats
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:29.300]   Fruit bats they're this big they're this big and the poop is unbelievable and well they got a fruit
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:36.580]   Exactly exactly. Well and the crazy thing is is I thought there that they it was random and then I realized they're really pooping at me
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:42.260]   Oh, no, they aim it. I don't know it feels like it's so gnar. Is there nothing it can't do?
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:49.140]   I know I know so anyway, so yeah, so it's right down the street, but it's it's a much different place than as I've said in the past
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:53.140]   It's it's a very safe country. I'm here working working at the school
[01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:55.780]   We're doing some planning sessions and lots of meetings
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:22:00.500]   And i'm going to be going into the into the rural areas to meet to look at some of the workforce training
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:05.940]   Schools out in the country on Thursday probably so pretty excited really great
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:08.740]   What do you got for us?
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:09.780]   two things
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:16.020]   Um one is a very little this is uh, I started getting these and now i've got a lot of them
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:22.820]   It's made by kiro at k er o and all it is is just a little very very tiny
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:27.620]   Uh usb to lightening bolt and um when you travel a lot
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:31.460]   Some people a lot of people watching the show are gonna be like, okay, this is no
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:32.820]   I like shorties
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:37.060]   Yeah, but the thing is is that this is really nice kind of little cap that you can you can attach to things
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.180]   Which I kind of like so
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:40.660]   Somebody's I have attached my bag and I just pull it off my bag
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:44.340]   And and um do it so that you know being able to attach the cap
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:47.780]   To the to the bag on the outside is geeky
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:50.340]   But useful, um, you're like
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:55.620]   So uh with your utility bag. Hey, you never know when you need to charge so uh, anyway
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:59.940]   It's it's I travel a lot. It's like every time you see it you see you see like a little outlet
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:05.380]   You're like huddling over there and and hoping that they're using a max so that they'll let you use the share the outlet anyway
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:08.980]   So the um, so kiro, they're not the cheapest, but they're they're really really useful
[01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:14.900]   They're durable and um and I like them a lot. So anyway, so that's one and then the other one every time I do the show
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:19.860]   Um from somewhere and I have my earpiece in someone asks which one that I use the ifbs
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.860]   I get these little twitter things
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:25.940]   So, um, I thought I'd just say it. This is uh, this is audio implements
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:27.700]   um
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.820]   And uh, these are the these are the ifbs
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:34.180]   There's a lot of them that are cheaper than these ones these are the headphones
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:37.060]   So this is an ifbs so it it is uh
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.900]   In here
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:42.260]   Oh, oh, I'm looking at my mic out with you. Yeah, so this is kind of what you see in broadcast
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.340]   You know, you just have a little earpiece
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:48.180]   Um, I don't have the molded one. They do do the molded ones. I don't have the molded one
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:52.660]   But it just goes over your ear and um, it's just a little bit more subtle than you know
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:55.620]   It's not very good for radio the the of but it's but it's um
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:24:00.420]   It's good for when you're doing this and you don't want big headphones or or something like that
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.980]   And there's you know, these are you buy them in different pieces
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:06.660]   The actual speaker is right here this little this little bit right here
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:10.580]   And then you have the little tube and then there's a variety of these little earpieces
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:13.620]   Um, these little hard ones are horrible, but but the um
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:16.180]   The what they call the accordion, which is this one here
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:19.620]   It's really dirty right now. So I apologize. I won't get it too close to the camera
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:24.980]   Um, but it just sticks right in there and um, and you can get molded ones and when we work with a lot of broadcasters
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:27.140]   That since this part pops off
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.300]   Here, um, you can
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:34.100]   Pop it on and a lot of broadcasters and politicians and stuff will have their own because they have their own molded one to their ear
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:37.540]   You can pop it in so anyway, um, they are you know
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:41.860]   It took a little while to figure out who the best people were to we went through a lot of ifbs and
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:48.580]   Um, these are definitely the best there. It's about 130 marks. I think for for which is, you know
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:54.820]   I'll show you the one that I I moved to at the office. Um, next time we do this, but uh, which doesn't have any tables at all
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.660]   Um, but um
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.300]   It's more expensive, but but this one this one is really really good
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:02.500]   If you're really serious about it, you want to get you know one that that really works
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:06.820]   Um, as I said, I get questions about it every single time so I figured I make it a recommendation and get it over with
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:11.940]   Love it. Thank you, Alex. Renee richy. You're big of the week
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.100]   I have I have a stack list of picks this week because a bunch of really good stuff came out
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:21.620]   The first are two apps by contrast of the people who make launch center pro and they've sort of broken out and enhanced
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:26.820]   Specific area of functionality one is called group text plus you know that's called email plus
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:29.780]   They do the same thing but one for messages and one for email
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:35.780]   So basically you can create groups of people and then you can create sort of actions and then what makes it so great is with ios
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:41.940]   You can save those actions to the share sheet so that you can do something like send a picture to my family or you know
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:45.140]   Take my location and tell them when i'm going to be home
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:52.500]   And it just it makes the process of texting or emailing just that much faster because it it launches your actions not just the apps
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:58.180]   So if if texting certain groups or certain people or doing certain actions are are a frequent thing for you
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:04.740]   These apps are a great way of doing it and because there's separate apps for email and for text you can set up separate actions for both of those things
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:07.220]   You don't have to you know choose between one or the other
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:11.380]   The second app i don't think anyone has picked this yet if they have i apologize
[01:26:11.380 --> 01:26:14.660]   But it's called workflow and it's one of those apps that make you go
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:19.620]   Oh my goodness an iphone can do this and it's by a group of really really young developers
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:23.460]   It makes it even more impressive and basically it's like automator for the iphone
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:26.420]   And it that's a huge statement to make but it really is true
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:33.220]   When you launch the app for the first time it shows you how to set up a workflow where it takes several pictures makes them into an animated
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.300]   GIF and then allows you to share that GIF
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:39.540]   I've had friends who've made workflows where it takes a photo put some text on it and zens it
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.380]   The twitter is an automatic meme generator
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:47.460]   And like the the list of things that you can do just goes on and on and you can make and share the different workflows as well
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:53.540]   And it really it makes you start to redefine your expectations for the iphone as a productivity tool
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:56.580]   And again, it's one of those things that you can save the actions to the share sheet
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.580]   So it's one of those things that ios 8
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:01.060]   Makes not only possible, but just so much better
[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:04.980]   It's incredibly incredibly impressive app and um
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:09.140]   The dreco vitticci at max stories has been doing, you know, he's the king of ios automation
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.860]   He's been doing some amazing amazing stuff with it
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:15.940]   And the last thing I just wanted to give a cheap plug to our iMORT awards
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:16.740]   They went live today
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:21.540]   So we went through and pick what we think are all the best apps for mac and ios and all the best accessories
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:25.940]   And the best devices of 2014 workflow is one of them
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.660]   Our app of the year was pixel mator
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.980]   Mac app of the year
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:35.140]   We have all sorts of stuff the stuff that we think was just the very very best this year
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:37.540]   So if you're looking for some more pics
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:38.660]   It's a good list
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:42.340]   Yeah, this is put together by Derek Kessler does a great job designing these things nice
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:46.660]   Very good and that is at iMORT.com
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:51.460]   Actually, just go to iMORT.com because the full bed on the front. Yeah, it's right on the front page
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:54.180]   Very nice. Thank you Renee. Thank you
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:58.020]   And now ladies and gentlemen, Andy and i cooish pick of the week
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:05.460]   I got a couple of holiday ones this time because it's it's no good to give you a holiday pick like when you can only enjoy it for about
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:07.060]   A day and a half
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:12.580]   So i'm going to give a plug for an an audible book patrick steward performing his one man show
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:14.820]   version of a christmas carol
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:18.820]   This has been a tradition for me ever since i bought it on cassette
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:24.100]   When i was in what like a few years after it first came out and then i had to buy it on cd
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:26.020]   And then i have had to get it on audible
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:32.100]   He'd been this his performance of this predates his time on star trek the next generation
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:37.460]   He just had been cultivating this one man performance of a sort of reduced version of a christmas carol
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:42.660]   He does all the characters. He does all the voices he makes a few edits that speed things along
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:46.660]   And this is the performance of a guy who absolutely knows this
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.060]   This show
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.060]   And loves doing it year after year after year
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:54.500]   And i'm not joking this really is like part of my holiday
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.620]   Is the day that i either it used to be the day
[01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:03.140]   I would take these cassettes out of the glove box and put them into the center console and start playing them
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:05.540]   And now it's the day when i just
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:09.060]   There i make sure that they're synced to all my devices so that i can keep listening to them
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.900]   Time and for time for time
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:16.500]   The second thing is that and this is something that a lot of people are going to be very interested in knowing that the very very last
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:21.220]   David letterman super holiday show is going to air on friday. This is the one where
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:22.580]   uh
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:26.420]   Letterman letterman and uh, uh, excuse me
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.860]   This is the one where darlene love does does the version of a christmas baby
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:33.060]   Please come home, which they they'd be doing for about uh 30 years
[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.540]   This is where j thomas comes on and he and dave
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:39.540]   Uh throw footballs at a christmas tree to knock a meatball off the top of it
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:43.860]   J thomas also tells his story about the villain ranger
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:47.940]   They've been doing this in the same format year after year after year
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:51.780]   Another thing that i'm not embarrassed to say is a beloved holiday tradition
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:55.780]   It's like if i if i were to ever miss this it would just not be
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:59.860]   As good a christmas celebration as possible and this year
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:04.900]   This is the very last one and i have taken us to the actual show itself on thursday
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:05.620]   You get to go
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:09.460]   i'm going to be there and if you listen to somebody who see gosh
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:14.820]   That sounds like a really high girly voice but as though it was from the diaphragm of a middle-aged man
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:17.300]   That's me cheering for darlene love
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.660]   Oh my gosh. i'm so glad you get to go
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:26.500]   Yeah, i'm pretty i'm pretty excited i've a friend who was nice enough to arrange for me to get a couple of tickets to that
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.820]   And he's the last one because he's retiring
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:34.180]   Yeah, exactly and just take just take a look at the montage that the show posted on youtube yesterday
[01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:42.340]   Of just year after year after year of these things it really is it just watch watch paul shay from the background because he grew up on
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:46.020]   On this kind of philspector music and he just is um
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:50.100]   He is just like a little kid playing this music. It's just fantastic
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:52.660]   Oh, you're gonna have a blast i'm so jealous boy
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:58.020]   I might i might be able to bring it started to work because i'm just so excited even even in concept of of seeing this live
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:00.180]   Now if they know who you are they'll put you in the balcony
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:02.260]   That's okay. Uh you get a good
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:09.060]   Well, no actual actual actually the balcony is this this is for anybody who is going to go see the letterman before the the show ends in may
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:16.180]   You the balcony is actually the place you want to be because it's the only place you can see the entire show without being blocked by cameras moving in and out
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:21.780]   Uh, there is an email that arrived with it saying we have an unusual number of guests for the show
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:27.700]   And so you might be seated in the orchestra. I don't care. I want even like to be sitting even just standing outside
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:32.260]   Yeah, I want to be seated in the or any anywhere where audio is bouncing off of
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:37.700]   Ob is coming out of darlin love and bouncing around and landing in here. That's fine
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:42.660]   I'm good one of my favorite memories see a scene letterman live. It really is a treat
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:47.300]   Yeah, this is this special special one to see. Yeah, and if you know
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:53.700]   If you've never had if you never had the chance part of the joy of seeing any letterman show live is the band plays through all the commercial breaks
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:59.940]   Yeah, and if you goodness gracious as impressed as you are with the work this band does during the show itself
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:04.660]   When you hear them just play three to sometimes seven minutes of uninterrupted rock
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:11.380]   Yeah, wow. What a what a sad loss is going to be when this band breaks up and is no longer performing together
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:13.140]   I I hope they record
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:16.260]   Something to leave the fans with because they're just phenomenal
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:20.100]   It'll be something like the experience we san francisco giants fans are going through
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:25.380]   In the off season as they slowly tear our team apart limb by limb
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.140]   Thank you, and I go chicago sometimes ladies and gentlemen
