[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   This is Detroit.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Bandwidth for Mac Break Weekly is provided by
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   cashfly@cachafly.com.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 42, for May 29th, 2007.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Justine, not Justin.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, ladies and gentlemen, and we are gathered together once again dispersed to the four wins, I'm sorry to say.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   No longer housed in the comfortable womb of the Padango Studios, we must instead venture forth into the real world.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Merlin Mann in the chilled avenues of San Francisco.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I can barely hear you, Leo. It's a very foggy day here.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Oh!
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Ooh!
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Oh!
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Oh, corn.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Scott Born, who is, I believe probably ensconced at Padango.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I am a Padango.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   But almost all alone, except for his friends.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Yeah, that's accurate.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Yes, he has friends.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And then I'm really thrilled to go to Pittsburgh to get Justine on the line.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   She's been on the line of Mac Break and Mac Break Weekly before.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Hi, Justine.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Hi, how are you?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   There's a little twist this time.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   She's also on Justin TV right now.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Yes.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Four days, 15 hours, and 15 minutes later.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Except it's only been today, so I think I'm not sure.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I know, why does it say that?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Today's the day you started is Justin.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Don't go to Justine.tv.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   No, I Justine.tv.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I'm going to forward that to the virtual link.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Because if you go to Justine.tv, unless you like thongs a lot.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   So it's I Justine.tv.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Oh, that was a good one to get.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Or you can go to Justine.tv/Justine.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I Justine.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   /I Justine.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And they talked you into wearing the headgear.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   They did.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   They did.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   How has that been for you?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Well, it's only been half of a day so far.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And pretty much all I've done is type all day.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   So I feel bad for anyone watching, but hey, we still have work to do.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I watched you drive in the car with Desiree.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I watched you at the coffee shop.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   There you go.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Crazy Mocha.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Yes, that's pretty much all we did today.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And you're going to a Pirates game later though, huh?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We're going to try to.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's supposed to start at seven o'clock, which is right now.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Oh.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   We might do that tomorrow.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It's okay.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   This is more fun than a Pirates game.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   It is more fun, but don't tell anyone.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Also, you wouldn't have to get the express written permission of Major
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   League Baseball.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   You would not.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   You would have to point the camera away from the game, I think.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I was pretty much just going to kind of hide it in my purse and see what happens.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I like what you said to the Apple store.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Was it true you told him that you needed it in order to see?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I did.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I told this kid I was blind.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You didn't buy it, huh?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   He did.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   He believed it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And I felt really bad out here.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And no doubt he was one of the geniuses at the Genius bar.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   No, actually just--
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   He just crossed your eyes a little bit and kind of like--
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He was just some random customer and he's like, "Hey, is that a camera on your head?"
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'm like, "No, this is actually--I need to use this to see."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And then I felt bad and I had to go tell him the truth afterwards.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Did you get thrown out?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   No, I didn't.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   They just accepted it.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   They didn't mind you being in there, huh?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Although you do have a history of being thrown out of the Apple store.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah, see, I saw that blog post, but that wasn't because of the camera.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   That was something else?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   No, that was actually fake.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   The guy, like he just randomly was joking around and he said, "Hey, no video blogging in the
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   store."
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   He just repeated and fake, getting kicked out.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You got to be careful with faking things because people believe it and then it lives on forever.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So true.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Chris Perilla learned that.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   They did a little staged thing where they were looking at Edison cylinders and the guy was
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   on and the guy said, "Yeah, there are only three of these.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I think Chris said, 'How much is this worth?'
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   He said, 'Well, it's priceless.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   There's only three.'
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And Chris says, 'Well, can I hold it?'
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And then drops it and it smashes.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And if you go to YouTube or anywhere, you'll see, you know, amazing blooper, but the whole
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   thing was staged.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Oh, I did see that.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That's pretty funny.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   The whole thing was staged.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   What about all those times that you misspeak and accidentally work blue on Tech TV?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Is that all staged?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Totally planned.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Really.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   We had it all worked out.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I've seen some pretty good outtakes on you.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Are you talking about the famous Bilbo Baggins blooper?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I think that's the one.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   You know, my kids found that recently.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.600]   And this is, again, an example of where you really got to be careful nowadays because everything
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   lives forever.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   It does.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   It stains us.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.000]   Now, you're smart because, you know, Justin wears the hat.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So really all we see is his messy bedroom and, you know, his hands fiddling with things.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But you take the hat off and you point it at yourself.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.600]   I mean, I'm probably going to do both.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.000]   I mean, I'll wear it and take it off, but it really depends.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I mean, I know I'd always get irritated.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm like, Justin, I'd like to see you when you're actually talking to us.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It makes it a little more interesting.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Well, speaking for Scott Borne, I think we'd all like to see you.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I'm going to say if my choice is looking at Justin or Justine, this is a pretty simple
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   choice.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   They tried to send me the hat, but I'm thinking I don't really want to do that.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I don't think my wife would let me do it for one thing.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Yeah, that might be interesting.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   She's a little adverse to getting me on camera in general.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   If I wake up in the morning with a hat on with a camera and say, "Hi, dear."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I'm getting it in the pusser, in the puss, just big fat fist, you know, "Poom!"
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So I don't think that's going to work.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yeah, that might not work out too well.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Wait, how long are you going to do this?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   You're going to do a 24/7 and everything?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Probably.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Really?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Other than if Gortonos is not going to have it on the shower or bathroom, none of that,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   but I mean, I pretty much can't.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I'm canceling my subscription.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Oh, stop.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Oh, no.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Justine, do you have a boyfriend?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Good choice.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Don't go blue because you can never go back.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Thanks, Lillen Merlin.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   He's been giving me that advice for years.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   We did that.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And then we went and came back on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   We took what the explicit tag up.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And we never even actually said any dirty words.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   No, we just did.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Yeah, you know who yelled at us?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Alex, he said, "I want my kids to watch!"
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Or listen.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Oh, we'll see.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   I know, I have to be very careful because I know my mom and my grandma watch everything.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Oh, that's so cool.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Alex has his kids watching and I have my mom and grandma.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So, how do you feel about it?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Are they think it's a good idea?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Well, I haven't really officially told them.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I've made mention to it.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   You don't think they noticed that camera on your head?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   You made a paper here.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   You were in the front page of the SF gate here.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I know.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   See, Pittsburgh hasn't really adapted yet, but I'm sure when they find out.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Plus, my mom reads my blog.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So, I'm sure when she gets home from work, she's going to find out and give me a call.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Tastyblogsnacks.com.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   She also has a site, a video site called "Mommy Packed My Lunch."
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   But they're changing that to "Mommy Clean My Lens."
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   It's a whole new site.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Oh, it's easy.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   She knows by now she's watching this.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Probably.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   She knows.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So, how about your boyfriend?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   What's how is he going to take to this?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Well, I don't have a boyfriend, so I probably wouldn't have agreed to this if I did because
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   he probably would have broke up with me.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   No dates, babe.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Right then and there.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   No, probably won't go to dates either.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Well, Justin goes out on dates, but I think it's kind of weird.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Yeah, they've all been awkward, so hopefully he finds a nice girl.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Soon.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   They've been painful.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And of course, your best friend Desiree appears a lot to us.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   She doesn't all your films.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   She doesn't.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   She doesn't.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   She's like, "Will you please just get that out of my face just for five minutes?"
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Yeah, because I was watching you guys drive.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Yeah, and she was on it just as much as you.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   That's actually a pretty good vantage point.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   The car cam.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yeah, it worked out pretty well.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Yeah, it looked great.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Yeah, it looked really good.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   All right, well, this is a show actually about Tech News.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Justine is justifiably the front page.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   By the way, they never reveal what the computer that you're using, but I believe it's a Mac Mini.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   You don't have to say, because now you're probably under an NDA.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Actually, well, it's a Sony, but anyway, it's a Sony.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   It's a Sony?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Yep, just keep going.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   It's a Sony?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It's a Sony?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It is.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It's a Sony?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It isn't.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   It's a cute little bio, actually.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I thought it was a Mac Mini.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I wish.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Oh, man.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   At least it's so.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   But you do have a Mac, don't you, Justine?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I do.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.500]   I have a Mac Mini and a nice MacBook Pro right in front of me.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.000]   She killed me on April Fool's Day.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   She really fooled me.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.600]   She was giving up her Mac and buying a Sony, and she even changed the title of her blog,
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.000]   where she's holding a Mac, and it was a bio.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Oh, my.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Oh, my.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Oh, my.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And I said, "You're dead to me.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I can't be doing this."
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   You're dead to me.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   You'll never be on Mac break.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Wiggly again, kid.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   No.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I banned you.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   All right.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.960]   Mac break weekly ideas is our website, mbwideas.com, in the most trivial use ever of a domain name.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.120]   This points to our delicious site.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.120]   Thank you, Merlin Man, for setting that up.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.880]   Oh, my pleasure.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.440]   What a waste of $9.50.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.920]   You know, that's the thing, though.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.720]   It's like you reach a certain point, and you just stop noticing.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.480]   Once you get up, once you pass 100, it's all, you just don't want to miss.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.400]   No wonder all the domain names are gone.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.800]   People are so lazy that they're, "I can't remember my to-do list.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.400]   Okay, let me just create a domain name for it."
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.360]   I guess nobody would use mbwideas.com, so.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.320]   I don't think we're depriving people of much, but nobody's dying with that one.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.040]   Actually, I've got more than 15,000 domains, because I keep going to look at the picture
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.040]   of the go-daddy girl.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.200]   That's so you just go, "I'll register something, sure.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   No problem.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   Whatever.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   All the fine."
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.880]   So I forwarded, I didn't forward it to you, because I didn't know you were going to be
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.960]   on Justie, but I forwarded it to you guys.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   Some iPhone news.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.760]   We might as well just get this out of the way.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.680]   iPhones, you know, going to be out in a few weeks, and we could finally stop speculating.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.920]   But what do you think of the news?
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.600]   Did you look over the mail I sent out there to you?
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   You just got bought.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   I got born.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   I didn't, I get it.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   Oh, you didn't get it?
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   No.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   Did you get it, Merlin?
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   No.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   I got it.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   I didn't read it.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.480]   I thought I thought I'd phone my iPhone, and my eyes started to gloss over.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.360]   Okay, I had a little nap.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.640]   Here's, I'll read you the stories.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.440]   Quanta wins order for second iPhone.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:35.080]   According to a Quanta computer, which is a big Apple manufacturer, along with Foxconn,
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.240]   they got a contract to deliver five million units starting in September, none of the existing
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:46.400]   iPhone, but a slightly different one for the non-US market.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.440]   According to the Chinese language commercial times, the iPhone, and by the way, I studied
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.360]   Chinese, so I'm reading this in translation.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.960]   The iPhone produced by Foxconn is designated for the US market.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.760]   Those manufactured by Quanta will be similar in function to those from Foxconn, but with
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.320]   a different outer design to fit different markets.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.800]   And there's some speculation it may also have a different design so that it can be 3G.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.760]   Oh, man.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.480]   This is the big, this is one of the big, well, pretty much the only complaint people have
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.160]   right now about the iPhone not having used it, but everybody knows it because it's made
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.120]   for AT&T.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.480]   It doesn't have the AT&T HSDPA in it.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.480]   It doesn't have...
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.680]   It's the one thing that people, you know, in terms of this looking at a spec sheet site
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.480]   unseen, the edge thing is something that has turned a lot of people off.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.400]   Yeah, I mean, for something with a great browser and everything that did not have high speed
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.560]   internet is a little odd, especially since singular offers, or I'm sorry, AT&T offers
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.560]   you.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.720]   Huh.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.480]   When I spoke with AT&T spokespersons today about this, Leo, they claim that the edge experience
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.480]   is going to be fine.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.080]   We'll find out if that's true.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.560]   They also point out that the edge network works in places that 3G does.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.160]   But they could do both.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.120]   I mean, many phones have both HSDPA and Edge.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.040]   I'm really surprised that the AT&T rep would say that it's going to be a good experience.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   Yeah, now I did...
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   I listened.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.040]   I qualified, okay.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   Didn't I?
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   Don't get me grieved by qualifying.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   That's going to suck.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.480]   I also want to point out that, of course, it will have Wi-Fi capability, which is faster
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.600]   than 3G Edge or anything else.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.200]   So was there ever any kind of a verdict on whether this will be able to do something
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.560]   anything Skype-like?
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.200]   Is that definitely on or off the rails?
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.960]   Well, there will be some Google applications on it.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.800]   And of course, one of the things Google has is Google talk.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.740]   Yeah, there's a lot of talk about Google widgets and things that we haven't been made
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.340]   privy to showing up later on the phone either at launch or a little bit later.
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.660]   I did get some background info on that today as well.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.660]   And we don't know.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.860]   It will be extensible at least vis-a-vis those widgets and who knows what else.
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.700]   And maybe what we'll find out on June 11th, Leo, is not that we're going to get the iPhone,
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.860]   but whether or not jobs intends to open up development of the sky as far as I'm concerned.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.460]   I've got to have third party apps.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.940]   I definitely hope so.
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.940]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.940]   What app would you put on there, Justine?
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:09.940]   I'm really excited.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.260]   I really hope for Google talk because I pretty much use that and I survive by it.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.860]   I can't use it on my trio.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.060]   I use it for my chat client all the time on my BlackBerry.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.060]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.620]   And because of things like I am a fied, you can use it then to post a Twitter and Jai
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.620]   Ku.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.540]   So it really gives it a huge amount of functionality.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.460]   I agree with you on that.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:33.060]   Perhaps Gmail, Google News Reader, G-Cal, according to the Seattle Times, people will
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.980]   be asked to have unlimited data packages when they get their iPhone.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.500]   Actually this is coming from Engadget.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.940]   Ryan Block, our good friend, writing there.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.940]   Okay.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.940]   I'm not going to forget it.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.940]   I didn't mention his name.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.940]   He doesn't.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.340]   Was that the $30 a month package they were talking about?
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.340]   Unlimited data.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.500]   It cost me on my BlackBerry packages, 50 bucks a month.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   But that's my phone.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.500]   That's my phone.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.500]   Yeah, mine is.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.900]   I spoke with a singular wireless chief spokesperson today.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.540]   The CEO, someone who is willing to be quoted and they said that any report, any report
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.300]   of any kind that claims to report to know what packages will be available, what they
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.820]   will cost is inaccurate.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.820]   Okay.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.820]   Good.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.420]   We have it from the horse's mouth.
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.220]   I don't really think they've made their minds up yet.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.220]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.220]   Well, they better hurry.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.220]   They got a print stuff.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.220]   Yeah, it's a.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.020]   They've made up their minds.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.340]   They've made their, they're print orders in.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.540]   You're not going to go to the printer and say, Oh, we need something tomorrow.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.260]   Well, they changed the signs overnight.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.340]   No, come on.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.340]   I don't know.
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.700]   I'm just telling you what he refused.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.580]   He said there is nobody that knows exactly what packages we're going to offer.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.580]   I pressed him on things like, what are you going to do if you're an existing customer?
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.820]   He says, I can't tell you.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.820]   I pressed him on.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.140]   Is there going to be a unity offering?
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.340]   He says, I can't tell you.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.500]   I pressed him on what you're going to have to have in order to be an AT&T customer with
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.220]   the iPhone in terms of data packages, et cetera.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.100]   He says, none of that stuff is going to be released until the phone is shipping.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.100]   So he said, anybody that purports to know that is making it up.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.100]   All right.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.940]   Well, I mean, he's certainly under an NDA the size of the Tibetan book of the dead.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.500]   There's no way he's going to reveal any of that.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.140]   The Tibetan book of the dead.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.140]   I mean, don't you think?
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.940]   I mean, I mean, talk about getting steaved.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.380]   I mean, to reveal any of that stuff.
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.380]   I did ask him.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.380]   I said, what's it like?
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.380]   I just have to lie.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.820]   I mean, nobody's saying, no, don't say that, you know, right?
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.820]   I did ask him.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.980]   I said, what's it like working with such a secretive company?
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.420]   And he said, well, we're fine with it.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.100]   He said, especially with a product like the iPhone, it makes sense.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.660]   And I mean, they all are.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.100]   I will notice I've seen several spokespeople for the company respond to those types of questions.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.860]   And it's interesting that they literally say the same thing word for word.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.300]   It's great working with Apple.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.300]   I mean, they literally say two sentences.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.180]   We love our partners.
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.180]   We love our partners.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.180]   They are wonderful.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.180]   Yes.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.860]   Steve Jobs is the kindest, bravest, warmest, and most wonderful human being ever known in
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.860]   my life.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.900]   I don't want to say this, but it almost sounds like they're reading off flashcards when
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.900]   they do that.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.900]   I'm so sorry.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.900]   Sure.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.900]   It's all scripted.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.620]   Sig-Sigler cards, we call them.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.620]   All right.
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.020]   Well, if you want to know more, I mean, that's it.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.140]   Unless you have any other iPhone news, we'll just point everybody to applephoneshow.com
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.260]   because that's where, of course, Scott Born lives.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.220]   And it's all iPhone all the time.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.220]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.420]   Anything else that we want to bring up before we move on?
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.420]   No.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.500]   Just, you know, just rumors, so no reason to talk about him.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.860]   Justine, are you going to wear the camera when you get in line at the AT&T store?
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.860]   I will.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.860]   I definitely will.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.860]   You'll be the first one, won't you?
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:33.860]   I know you will.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.940]   I'll be there.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.980]   I've actually thinking, you know, I've been saying I was going to get one.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.420]   And now I'm thinking maybe not.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.700]   Maybe I'll just wait.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.540]   Just to make you crazy, Scott.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.620]   Well, you know, I wanted, I want you to know, Leo, I was pretty impressed with your Nokia
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.620]   in '95.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.620]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.620]   So I got a hold of one.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.620]   Oh, you actually got one?
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.620]   Well, you should have one.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.620]   You got one.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.620]   I got a hold of it.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.620]   I didn't buy it.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.620]   I used it.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.140]   And I was in a call that dropped.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.820]   And I want you to know that I'm not too worried about the N95 being a competitor to the iPhone
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.700]   because it took 12, count them 12 key presses to get back to redial.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.500]   So really, I don't think they're quite there.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.900]   See, all you have to really do is press that little green button, Scott, and then press
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.340]   it again, and it dials it again.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.740]   It didn't work when you drop a call.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.740]   It doesn't do it like that.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.420]   It does it on my phone, but I guess it's probably too complicated for you.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.460]   I have an orthogonally related iPhone question for Justine.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.820]   Justine is a-- I know you're a text message monster.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.100]   I've seen it.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.380]   And so I think we might have talked about this once before, but I'm curious.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.300]   So how do you feel about the whole iPhone keyboard thing?
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.020]   Is that-- are you looking forward to it?
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.020]   Is it freaking out?
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.020]   How do you feel about it?
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.300]   I don't know, because I've really got used to the Trio keyboard.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.300]   So I don't know.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.300]   I'm not sure.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.300]   I haven't used it yet.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   Nice to have that feedback.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   You know?
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.300]   You've decided to hit a key.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.060]   It's going to be very interesting to see how--
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.260]   Congratulations, Justine, for not attacking the phone prior to using it.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.260]   I'm getting to hate it more and more, Scott.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.260]   I know.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.220]   And it's because of you.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.220]   It's because of you.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.300]   It's all my fault because I'm just--
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.500]   You're driving me crazy.
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.180]   It's like you're such a pro-- you're so pro-iPhone that I'm starting to hate it.
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.380]   I'm pro-iPhone, but yet you look at my blog and you'll see I have a post-dissing singular
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.380]   in AT&T.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.540]   I have post-pointing out potential problems with the network.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.700]   I'm not pro-iPhone.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.460]   I'm just asking people to give it a chance.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.860]   And let me tell you, I'm prepared to make my show the anti-iPhone show.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.860]   I know.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.860]   I know.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.860]   That'll happen.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.860]   That's going to be really rough.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.060]   That'll never happen.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.780]   Apparently, MacRumors.com has been looking at their log.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.020]   Did you see this?
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.020]   I saw this.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.780]   They-- oh, and look at our refers.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.940]   We've been browsed with an iPhone.
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:48.660]   Because you know, refers are up there with email headers in terms of difficulty to fake.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.660]   Right.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.020]   And Safari, you have to pull down to a menu to do it.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.020]   3.0 mobile.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.700]   Oh, Brazzy, is that-- well, you know, I don't know.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.660]   And even if it were true, who cares, right?
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.540]   Of course, somebody's got them.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.380]   Well, yeah, I mean, they're going to be out there testing stuff.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.820]   I'm being unnecessarily unkind.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.820]   That would be very exciting.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.820]   Oh, it's easy.
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.820]   No, you're absolutely right.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.380]   It's easily faked.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.100]   Yeah, I mean, like in OmniWeb, that's like--
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.860]   You can just pick the strip.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.500]   Or you can say per site what browser you want to look like.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.660]   I'm surfing everywhere as an iPhone right now.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.660]   Really?
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.660]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:27.660]   Just thought that'd be fun.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.660]   I'm crazy.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.260]   You should surf as an iPhone too.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.060]   That would be disruptive.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.860]   Now that would really be disruptive.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.940]   OK, deal.
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.140]   So the latest rumor, if you're reading on the iPhone, if you're reading Mac rumors, is
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.580]   that the Mac mini is history.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.540]   I guess we talked about that last week.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.540]   Would we be sad at the end of the Mac mini?
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.500]   I would actually really like my Mac mini.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.900]   I have the first generation.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.900]   Me too.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:56.900]   And it works great.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.540]   And I still use it just for MP3s and all the little stuff.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.700]   Actually, I have the first Intel Mac mini.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.700]   So that's not the first generation.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:03.700]   Oh, no.
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.620]   I like it a lot.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.300]   And it's a good little computer.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.940]   You think it's a move to avoid cannibalization on Apple TV sales?
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.340]   I eat brains.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.340]   Or Mac mini's.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.300]   That's exactly what I thought.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.500]   I first saw that rumor.
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.340]   I thought, you know, this thing looks like a Mac mini.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.980]   The Apple TV looks like one.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.540]   It's the same form factor.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.780]   I've got a handful of friends that are like, I don't need an Apple TV.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.940]   I'm really happy with this Mac mini I've got by my TV.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.020]   So I just want to--
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.020]   Ah, ah.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.020]   Ah, that makes sense.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.020]   It's more capable too, isn't it?
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.020]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.020]   Oh, I do.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.020]   But it's more expensive too, though.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.020]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.980]   I like my Apple TV a lot.
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.260]   If it weren't so hot--
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.260]   Dude, mine has been dropping like a bad habit.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.260]   Do you think it--
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.260]   Oh, my God.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.060]   I think it and I surf to my iTunes library.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.500]   Yes, see, I stopped using the-- you're right.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.700]   Unless you're all G and you're pretty close by, I think the streaming doesn't work all
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.700]   that well.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.700]   But if you sync up the data and you're running it off the Apple TV, I haven't had a trip
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.700]   with that.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   It's not that.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.460]   The connection-- with a connection for me, the connection where-- okay, so how can I
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.460]   express this?
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:10.780]   I get nothing on the Apple TV and then I go look at the host computer and there's nothing
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.180]   under devices for the Apple TV.
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.180]   Oh, I haven't had that.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.180]   It's lost its--
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.420]   You have to enter the number again and do it with the whole--
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.380]   I've got to take my rubber chicken out from under the bell jar and shake it around and
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.980]   see lots of re-starts and incantations and sometimes--
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:23.980]   That's right.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.980]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.380]   I haven't had that problem.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.180]   But now I'm on an all-G network for that.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.260]   So I have the new extreme and I have the MacBook Pro with a G card.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.820]   Yeah, I wonder--
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.820]   Are you on B or--
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.820]   Oh, you know.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.820]   --not G.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.820]   Did I say G?
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.820]   I'm at N.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.820]   I'm all N.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.820]   You know, I-- right.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.300]   I finally plugged my--
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.340]   Where's Craig with his box?
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.340]   We need the box.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.340]   Oh, my god.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.420]   We made the box and never got to use it.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.340]   I wasn't having a lot of luck with my airport extreme.
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.060]   I should probably give it another shot.
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.540]   I've been trying to focus my efforts on--
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.540]   Yeah, you did.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.820]   You took it out of operation, didn't you?
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.820]   That way to make--
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.660]   You picked the airport extreme one week as your pick of the week.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.180]   Oh, that's not accurate.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.940]   What I picked was the software for the airport--
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.940]   Oh, OK.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.940]   --and reserved.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.940]   Which I still like.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.820]   But, you know, it's good.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.780]   And I really got to say I like mine a lot.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.780]   And I finally got into a point where it started to really become more fun for me is
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:24.420]   I've got a workflow that works now in terms of getting media onto there.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.340]   So getting Visual Hub working the way that I want.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.340]   I love that.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.940]   And I think with a little bit of Automator Mojo, I could really take this to the next
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.940]   flow.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.380]   I downloaded all of the tutors from an unnamed site.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.020]   And then I used read it through Visual Hub.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.980]   And then I had automatically copied to the Apple TV.
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:40.980]   And then--
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.980]   Now, Handbrake, Canbrake.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.020]   Well, Handbrake doesn't automatically add it to iTunes.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.220]   That would be the next missing piece.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.220]   You can probably Apple's got that.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.340]   But Visual Hub does it.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.340]   Visual Hub will.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.260]   And I haven't found a file format yet on the internet that I can't convert with Visual
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.260]   Hub.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.420]   Well, but if you want to make a backup of a personal TV--
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.420]   Oh, the TV TV.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.300]   Oh, I let other people do that and just download it.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.460]   Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:06.460]   But it would be nice if Handbrake now, as we talked about before, has built-in iPod and
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.100]   Apple TV settings.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.260]   So it's like one click.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.260]   And it just does all the--
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.180]   As does Visual Hub.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.180]   I love Visual Hub.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.700]   That is, to me, that is so worth whatever it was, $30 or whatever.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.380]   It's been working like a champ for me.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.460]   So yeah, I haven't tried ripping DVDs and putting them on the Apple TV mostly because
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.260]   I watch the DVDs.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.500]   And then I use the Apple TV for TV shows mostly.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.140]   And by the-- whenever I can, I buy them on iTunes.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.220]   If they're not on iTunes, well, then--
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.620]   Yes, you don't watch them.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.620]   That's really wonderful.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.620]   I guess I don't watch them.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.620]   Right.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.900]   Make them on iTunes if you want me to see them.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.900]   Right?
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.540]   Do you have an Apple TV, Justine?
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.540]   I don't.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.140]   How do you watch TV?
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:49.300]   I think we established that-- I mean, I do have a TV, but I really never watch television.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.060]   So I just watch it on my monitor or on my laptop.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.100]   TV watches you, and that's the way it ought to be.
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.100]   iJustine.com.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.100]   Is it about the TV?
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.100]   TV.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.100]   Yes.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.060]   People from Pittsburgh and watching TV on their computer.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.100]   Yeah, based on our empirical study of Alex and Justine, we decided that nobody--
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.740]   Well, so far, everyone that I know from Pittsburgh does.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.740]   So, really--
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.740]   The two people you know from Pittsburgh.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.740]   The two people.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.740]   We know a little--
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.740]   Yeah, it's a small sample.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.740]   I'll own that.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.740]   But--
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.700]   Intel's slashing its prices 40% to 60% for the quad core server processors.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.660]   Looks like-- and a new one's coming up.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.740]   AMD's got the Barcelona coming up.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:33.620]   So Intel's seeing the competition on the way is going to drop the prices on Kent's
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.180]   field and Clovertown.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.180]   That's exciting.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.620]   Can you add those aftermarket?
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.620]   Oh, no.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:42.620]   Oh, no.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.540]   You can add the-- what's the next one up?
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.100]   The Crestview, Crestwood.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.500]   But the Clovertown's the one, the Xeon, that comes with the Mac Pro.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.780]   And then I guess the Octo has the new one.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.260]   You know, my Mac Pro is plenty fast.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.580]   How do you like it?
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.580]   It's great.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.580]   Isn't it great?
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.580]   It's absolutely smooth.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.580]   I've got no issues with it.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.300]   It runs-- heck, if it runs Pro Tools, it'll run anything.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.700]   Well, and that's what I was saying is that, you know, 4 is enough for most people, I would
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.700]   think.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.060]   Yeah, I've never had it.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.860]   I've been-- I got like plug-ins out the Wazoo on every track and no problem.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.860]   Hey, we want to--
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:17.860]   Go ahead.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.860]   Say, what does that mean in terms of for consumers?
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.100]   Does that mean we're going to see drops in Mac Pro prices?
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.100]   Yes.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.100]   Like, what--
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.100]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.140]   Assuming that Apple passes them along, but 40% to 60% is a pretty hefty drop of that.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.740]   I'll make a piece of the Mac Pro.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.220]   How big a piece of the Mac Pro retail price is-- do the chips represent?
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.860]   You know, John de Vorex good at this, and it's always a huge chunk.
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.500]   But like the processor itself, I think is $500 or $600, I can't remember the exact thing,
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:46.180]   but let's say it dropped $300 in price.
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:51.260]   That would mean a significantly, like $1,000 or more in the price of the computer.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.820]   Historically, what I think they do is they come out with the next rev at the same price.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.820]   Right.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.140]   So you get the faster chip next time.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.020]   It's like those of us that ordered the Mac Pro.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.420]   We ordered a 2 gigahertz processor and we got a 2.16 or whatever.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.420]   Right.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.420]   Yeah, maybe that's what they'll do.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:12.740]   Although this is just a-- there is no next generation chip coming out at the same time.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.660]   Intel's just lowering prices because of the AMD chip, not because of their own chip.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.100]   So yeah, it will be interesting to see what Apple does in response to this.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:24.820]   I mean, everybody in the PC world dropped prices immediately.
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:31.780]   Congratulations to John Foster's launching his new Macbreak Tech podcast.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:36.260]   It says, "If you love Macbreak weekly, half as much as you love our own podcast."
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.460]   This is Mac user talking.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:43.220]   And enjoy the vocal stylings of Mac Blake Greekley, regular and show notes author John Foster.
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.820]   He's famous as the show notes author.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.660]   He's got vocals of the stylings.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.820]   John Foster has vocal stylings.
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.820]   Macbreak Tech.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.620]   It's really technical.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.020]   Just the way I like it.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.340]   John's great at that stuff though.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:59.620]   He's so knowledgeable and like he's not afraid to just really open the throttle on some pure
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.620]   geek joy.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.620]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.620]   I love it.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:09.060]   So you can find it at macbreaktech.com.
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.540]   That's just basically an equally as like mbw ideas.com.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.060]   It's basically a link to the feed.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.940]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.980]   And it's because nobody would put the feed anywhere.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:24.140]   So that's how you-- is it on iTunes yet or is it still missing on iTunes?
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.860]   I think it is.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.820]   We just put up a new-- I have to say thank you for Scott Simpson.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.780]   It's just thank you Scott Simpson.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:33.780]   Thank you Scott Simpson.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.780]   Thank you Scott.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.780]   I can't pay enough.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.860]   He's Mr. iTunes and along with Pete Alcorn.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.420]   Fantastic taste both of them.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.580]   Yes.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.340]   And they recently-- you know I just added a new podcast today jumping monkey's a parenting
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:52.100]   podcast and he was very quick to snap it up and handle all the doodads for me.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.100]   So I thank you very much.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.900]   It's absolutely available on the iTunes Store.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.900]   Excellent.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.900]   Yep.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.900]   So do a search for that.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.540]   It's in the tech I'm sure.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.980]   How many episodes did you put out now?
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.100]   There's one up right now.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.100]   It's under software how to.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.740]   But if you do a search on the store, it'll turn up for a Macbreak Tech.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.740]   Great.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.660]   Great, great, great.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.660]   Let's see.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.780]   Was anybody at the Apple Store in San Francisco when the zombies arrived?
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.780]   I was there.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.780]   You were in the store?
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.780]   It's amazing.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.780]   I was actually in the store.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.780]   Tell us about it.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:27.740]   I saw people-- I didn't have any clue what was going on.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.980]   First of all, I saw these people that looked like they had next gashed open and I was
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.380]   like, why is that person walking around so calmly?
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.100]   It looks like they're next been bleeding.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.820]   And then I walked into the Apple Store and there was a guy chewing on an iMac and I said,
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.020]   OK, something is very unusual here.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.780]   Did you leave teeth marks?
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.820]   I don't know because at that point in time I decided it might be prudent to move on to
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.820]   the restaurant.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.820]   Oh, you didn't want to stick around?
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:52.740]   No.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.980]   I was getting ready to do what I'm best at, which is eat.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.980]   I would have loved to have been there.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.820]   There were hundreds of them.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.820]   They were everywhere.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.820]   I could--
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.260]   What if they got blood on those poor Macs?
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.260]   I don't know how terrible--
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.260]   Well, they were like fake blood.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.980]   But I mean, what was really interesting was in the restaurant an hour later I'm sitting
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.380]   next to people with bloody necks.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.460]   Because they just casually hung out and got something to eat.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.500]   Apparently that's what happened.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.740]   They had a little party.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.740]   They were shopping.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.740]   They were eating.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.620]   So it wasn't just the Apple Store.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.420]   It was the whole shopping district downtown.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:33.180]   You know, from about Westfield Mall all the way up to the iTunes, I mean to the Apple Store,
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.380]   then over to Virgin Orchards.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.380]   Orchards.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.380]   That's pretty funny.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.620]   They were walking around everywhere.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.620]   It was bizarre.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.620]   Eat brains.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.620]   It's awesome.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.660]   They coincided with the bicycle thing that happens too, by the way.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.660]   Yes, critical mass.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:45.660]   Critical mass.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.660]   So we had critical mass.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.660]   We had zombies.
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.540]   I mean, it was the typical San Francisco day.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:55.980]   The message is don't drive downtown or you're just going to be sorry.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.780]   Last Friday of every month is an excellent day to take part.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.900]   Yeah, I'll get it.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:01.900]   That's the day for critical mass.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.380]   And that's, I guess, when they chose to do this as well.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.460]   They've kind of ratcheted it up.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.820]   I noticed that several of the guys had M50's mounted on the front of their bike.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.820]   Shh.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.100]   And what would you do with that?
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.100]   Just joke.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.100]   Oh, okay.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   It's a machine.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.100]   I know.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.100]   I have my little words.
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.100]   A 50 caliber machine.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   I believe it.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.100]   No, it's a.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.100]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.100]   Yeah.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.100]   Let's see.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.740]   What else can we talk about here?
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.180]   What about the new MacBook Pro?
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.620]   Is there the new MacBook Pro?
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.180]   There's a new MacBook Pro.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:41.700]   The rumor is that WWDC Steve will surprise everybody with a new version, an updated version
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.580]   of the MacBook Pro and maybe the MacBook.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.980]   Is this going to be a speed bump or what do you think?
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.540]   I think we're going to see a little speed bump, but mostly we're going to hear about
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.900]   the backlit LED screens we've been prompted.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:54.900]   Oh, that's right.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.300]   And that's, yes, that's right.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.300]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.460]   The new MacBooks are not LED screens, are they?
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.460]   Negative.
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.460]   Okay.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.140]   So they'll have to rev those as well.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.020]   Yeah, I don't know whether the rumors I'm hearing are we're only going to hear about
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.420]   MacBook Pro and maybe MacBook.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.420]   It seems less likely the MacBook.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.100]   But I think they decided that, you know, having another WWDC where they basically did
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.820]   a complete carbon copy of the WWDC they did a year ago, where they said, "Hey, we're
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.020]   going to do this new operating system called Leopard."
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.380]   It probably wasn't enough.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:30.660]   I talked about this on the radio on Friday because the morning show host of KFI insisted
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.660]   the iGasm.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.660]   Oh, God.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.660]   Mm.
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.660]   This is...
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.660]   Apple's your estimate.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.500]   Apple is not feeling the love on the iGasm.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.300]   Apple's not happy, but you know, they're more unhappy not because the iGasm exists because
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.300]   there's other things.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.020]   There's that little dog, the iGog that dances to your iPod.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.020]   And this really...
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:54.900]   Yeah, but this is just kind of a minor modification to the same mechanism.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.900]   But what...
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.380]   It's created by a porn star, I guess.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.940]   I don't know her name.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.940]   Let's see.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:01.940]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.860]   Just don't say it, Leo, because you got in trouble last time you did something like
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.860]   that, okay?
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.860]   And Summers.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.540]   She has a completely normal name.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.540]   And Summers.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.300]   And she...
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:15.500]   There's an ad that looks just like an iPod ad.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.740]   And that's where they got in trouble.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.740]   Yeah, that's where they got in trouble.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.700]   And I think, and Silhouette of her, and she's got the white earbuds on, and she's got some
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:28.780]   sort of device in her hand, and seems to be sneaking downwards into her pajama bottoms,
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.780]   or whatever.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:30.780]   So wrong.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.780]   Was that clean enough for you?
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.380]   I was wondering how you could pull that off.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:42.220]   I'm not going to vouch for the usefulness of the product, but I do think...
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.020]   Now, by the way, they said they're going to fight.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.020]   They say, "You can't...
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.020]   What do you mean?
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.340]   What do you think you're going to add?"
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.340]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.340]   How do you...
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.340]   I mean, this is certainly...
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:56.740]   This has been parody, and Stolp for years, the whole idea of the mostly, you know, Silhouette
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.740]   figure...
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.740]   I don't know.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.740]   I mean, how do you...
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.220]   What's the heart of there?
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.740]   So I haven't followed these.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   You know, they're...
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:04.740]   Well, they just say it's...
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.380]   CND or something like that?
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.380]   I don't know what they did.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.380]   I mean, they're...
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.540]   I guess they must have got a CND.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.820]   Apple's legal team appears to have... it's knickers in a twist.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.660]   Hello, hello, this is a...
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.900]   I think them trying to sue them is probably going to give it more publicity, because if
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.900]   they wouldn't have, I probably never would have even heard of this.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.900]   Oh, you bet.
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.900]   They shouldn't have said anything in the first place.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.900]   No.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.020]   Yeah, especially if there's any merit.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:36.820]   Well, now, I had to disagree with you, I think in terms of copyright, which is different
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.060]   than trademark, they may indeed have a case.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.300]   Yeah, I don't think so, because there's so many other silhouette ads like this, and they
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.380]   haven't fought those that they've long ago.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.380]   They have no duty.
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.380]   This is what's interesting.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:53.900]   They actually have no duty to fight these, like they do the trade-mark violence.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.900]   They want...
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.220]   And to strip down all the ads, so to speak, for the I-Gasm, face legal action.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.020]   Yeah, they want to see a little more skin.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.740]   This would have made a lot of sense if they made it for the Zoom, since it's much more
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.380]   common for you to find someone a single person.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.380]   It was a Zoom person.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.140]   Oh, yeah, lonely Zoom owners.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.140]   They lonely Zoom owners.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.940]   Actually, the Zoom would be able to have a wireless I-Gasm.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.020]   The Zoom has right Wi-Fi.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.020]   Imagine the power.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.940]   You could share that with one of your friends.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:26.220]   The Zoom has crossed a border.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.380]   They've sold a million units now.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.380]   Please read the article.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.380]   She's with the article.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.220]   Oh, it's not a million units?
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.220]   The MacBook.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.060]   The MacBook has something to say about this.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.900]   If you read it carefully, he says, "By the end of June, we will have."
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.900]   Well, that's another one.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.900]   They're close.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.900]   Yeah, they're close.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:48.020]   And we don't know who these million are, 900,000 for the Microsoft employees.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.340]   What does the Macallope say?
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.900]   You know, Leo, I think we need to get the Macallope on the show.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.900]   I think we should.
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.900]   Do you have a number for him?
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.540]   I'll call him right now.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.620]   I've extended a friendly antler to the Macallope.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.740]   Does he look like Boinko?
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.740]   You know what?
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.740]   I'm kind of like that kind of--
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.740]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.740]   Watch me pull a Macallope out of my head.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.740]   Hey, Leo.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.740]   Put up the sleeve.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:14.740]   Ooh.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.740]   Still.
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.740]   We're old.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.300]   We should definitely have the Macallope on.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.540]   No, the point is this is actually your buddy, right?
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.540]   This is Paul--
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.540]   Yeah, the yelling of Paul Thoreau.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.540]   My buddy and Twitter podcast are Paul Thoreau.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.340]   But the actual quote was, let's see.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.340]   So where is this?
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.340]   It's not that far off.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.340]   Come on.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.540]   I mean, it's going to be in the months.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:39.780]   So if somebody said that about the iPhone, I would have got 2.3 million emails.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.900]   The San Francisco Chronicle generated a lot of buzz for Microsoft yesterday by printing
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.740]   a claim that the software giant had already sold more than a million zoons.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.860]   So it's the Chronicle.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.740]   The number comes from an interview with Robbie Bach.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:55.220]   I'm sure that that's the problem is that Paul saw the Chronicle article and believed the
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.380]   Chronicle.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.260]   The number comes from an interview with Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's Entertainment
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.260]   and Devices Division.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.260]   The print version has, quote, "widely repeated in subsequent commentary here, here, and
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.100]   nearly 40-- wasn't 40 newspapers and wire service reports around the world."
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.900]   I'm sure Paul's corrected it by now.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.660]   Bach said, "We're still about nine months into having Zoom in the marketplace.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.580]   We're very pleased with the progress.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.140]   We've sold a little over a million zoons."
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   Okay.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.060]   In the category, we're in the hardest-based category.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.380]   We've got about 10% market share.
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.300]   It's a good start, not an overwhelming start.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   So Bach said, "We've sold a million zoons."
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.580]   Have you ever seen anyone using a Zoom?
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:34.580]   I'm starting to think that--
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.300]   Yeah, I don't know where these millions are going.
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.300]   I never have.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.300]   I never-- I think it's okay.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.620]   So you go on Muni or Bart here in San Francisco.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.500]   And actually, when people come to town, they always notice this.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.220]   And you know, understandably, there's a market lead.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.900]   They got off for a splatter, blah, blah, blah.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.500]   But like frickin' everybody.
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:53.660]   I don't know what it's like in Pittsburgh, Justine, but everybody here has got some iPod.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.660]   Oh, everybody.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.660]   It's bizarre.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.660]   Yeah, they do here too.
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.580]   Walked out on the street and pretty much everyone has the earbuds in.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:04.420]   My buddy who is not a tech guy at all said, "I've got an iPod in my--" and you know,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.180]   our other buddy who's even less technical has an iPod.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.740]   It mustn't be cool anymore because we've got him.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.900]   President Bush has one.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.020]   The queen has one.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.020]   The pope has one.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.940]   President Bush has an iPod.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.380]   Yeah, Jenna, the girls gave it to him.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.580]   Oh, that's so cute.
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.900]   Yeah, he listens to it when he's biking.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.100]   So the choices of music are not stellar.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.100]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.500]   You're not seeing hoodie in the blowfish.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.500]   You're seeing--
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   Oh.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.500]   The Greenwood on repeat.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.500]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.500]   You got it.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   I'm proud to be.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   You got it.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.500]   You got it.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.300]   No, I think he even has some disco too, actually.
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.300]   I'm not-- and this is not a shot of it without.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.300]   That's why he's gay.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.700]   This is just a straight up empirical thing.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.700]   I have a friend.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.900]   I believe my friend Andre bought one.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.060]   Andre Torres bought one with money and has a Zoom.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.340]   And so I know from--
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.340]   Why?
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.940]   Yeah, I think he wanted to--
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.380]   he's a techy kind of guy.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.740]   He's a hacky guy.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.340]   And he wanted to see what it could do.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.020]   So he has one.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.020]   He has all kinds of stuff.
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.140]   But it's just funny.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.500]   You don't see people--
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.260]   you just don't see him around.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.180]   No, you don't.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.380]   Apparently, I was not just thinking--
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.060]   I was going to Microsoft employees.
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:13.660]   You're probably right.
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.660]   Apparently, by the way, the issue
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.540]   is that the Chronicle had a misquote.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.060]   The full quote for Bach was, when we
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:25.540]   finish our fiscal year-ins in June, as you say,
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.540]   we'll have sold a little over a million zones.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.260]   I'm an actor.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.940]   So it's an editing error.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:36.900]   But it took Apple 14 months to reach 600,000 iPod sales.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:42.460]   Of course, they sold $25 million in the same period last year.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.300]   And they started with a much smaller market share to talk.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.260]   Right.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.460]   They did.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.620]   But the thing is, oh, let's just have some ridiculous touchy
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:52.460]   feely resolution.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.500]   It would be great if it got popular
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.500]   enough if a few more people bought them,
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.340]   that it became a way to drive the competition.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:00.980]   Absolutely.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:01.980]   Competition's good.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.300]   It'll drop to price.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.580]   We want the Zoom to succeed.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.540]   That's what scares me.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.260]   If there's anything that scares me about Google,
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.580]   I mean, there's, of course, something inside.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.540]   It's an competition, yeah.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:13.500]   It's mainly the fact that there's
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.780]   there's nobody out there to hold their feet to the fire
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.580]   on keeping stuff moving forward.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:21.580]   Let's start a competing product called Schmugel.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.660]   How many do you think you'll ever win?
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.020]   There is a legal.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.460]   L-E-O-O.
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:25.980]   I'm not kidding.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.860]   L-E-O-G-L-E.com.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.220]   Go ahead.
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:29.860]   Take it.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.820]   Type away.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:31.740]   I'm typing it.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.660]   We're going to take your--
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.380]   L-E-O-G-L-E.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.900]   L-E-O-O-G-L-E.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.380]   Oh, oh.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.220]   Two O's.
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.140]   Because it's Google with an L-E instead of a G.
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.820]   Oh, that is so crafty.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.460]   L-E-O-G-L.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.060]   I didn't do it.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.460]   Sasha.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:43.980]   That's great.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.140]   Sasha Lopez.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:45.900]   He's crazy.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.460]   He's a crazy man.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.660]   Apparently, that wasn't hard to do.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:49.500]   I don't know what he did.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.100]   He did magic.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.100]   So the president's iPod-- now, this
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.780]   is a two-year-old article from CNN.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.180]   He might have updated it.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:57.940]   But of course--
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.380]   He probably has it, though.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.180]   But probably not.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.340]   And probably he didn't do anything.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.460]   Probably some aide did it.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:08.820]   He's got my shirona by the neck.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.060]   My shirona.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.540]   Oh, you--
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.820]   He's got-- let's see.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.260]   You write a lot of country.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.860]   C-A.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.700]   A lot of country.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:23.380]   ABC News.
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.340]   What does Bush's iPod reveal about him?
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:26.740]   Let me guess.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.300]   There ain't just a whole bunch of Dixie chicks on there, huh?
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.380]   He's got Joni Mitchell's.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.500]   You're so square, baby.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.580]   I don't care.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.820]   He's got a little Stevie Ray Vaughan.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:34.420]   That's pretty good.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.260]   This house is rockin' hip.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.300]   That's Stevie Ray's hip.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:37.780]   I'll give him some--
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.100]   The realm with that.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.340]   Nothing wrong with Stevie Ray.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.980]   The man could play guitar.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.340]   Alan Jackson's gone country.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.220]   John Fogarty, who actually campaigned against him--
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.420]   probably didn't know that when he put it on there.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.660]   That's the beauty of an iPod.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:58.180]   It's just as easy to take songs off it as is to put them on.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.780]   Now, according to Boing Boing, there
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.940]   is some Beatles music on there.
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.700]   And as we know, the Recording Industry Association of America
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.780]   says ripping CDs is illegal.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:13.820]   So Mr. President, I ask you, how'd you get the Beatles on there?
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.660]   Uh-oh.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.100]   Somebody has some explaining to do.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.700]   Splaining to do.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.980]   It was all Alberto's fault.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.740]   Gonzales did it.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.340]   I asked him for an opinion.
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.740]   He said it was OK.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.580]   It's his fault.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:25.980]   It is.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.180]   You're probably right.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.700]   Actually, I don't have any recollection of ripping
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.300]   Revolvers.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.300]   I have--
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.780]   Let's have a--
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.020]   There's no sort of destroyed.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.020]   We need a hearing.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.380]   Just having that would be funny.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.540]   I'm sorry I have no recollection of that.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.140]   Is it fair to say, Mr. Bush, that you are and be the walrus?
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:51.540]   Did a statement that you would be inclined to agree with?
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.900]   I like that.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.060]   And probably as if they would say that they can't remember
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.820]   which of the internet they downloaded the song from.
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.820]   Right.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.340]   Ooh.
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.740]   Right.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:03.580]   The big tube or the little tube.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.700]   So let's see.
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:11.140]   Moving up through the list at mbwideas.com.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.140]   Paleo, this is from a dark hawk.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.700]   And we appreciate it, by the way.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.700]   When you see a story, you think we should be talking about
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.460]   on the show.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.980]   If you just tag it, put it on Delicious
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.340]   and tag it, mbwideas.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.540]   One word, mbwideas.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.380]   So Greyhawk put a link to a video on--
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.980]   this is kind of a neat blog.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.460]   Paleo Future.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.900]   Oh, it's a terrific blog.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.780]   You've read it, but tell us more about it.
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:37.780]   What is the blog?
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.820]   Oh, it's just a wonderful site.
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.620]   It's kind of all about the future that never was.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.380]   Never happened.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:43.900]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.420]   You know, where's my jet pack type stuff?
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:50.660]   And some of it's the what Cory Doctorum might call
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.740]   sort of steampunk stuff.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.220]   A lot of it is-- like, there's stuff
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.820]   like there was the other day there was a postcard of people
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.940]   imagining what--
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:01.540]   I think in the early 1900s, imagining everyone will
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.580]   travel into "Rigibles" in the year 2000.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.020]   And it's the--
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.500]   It's like that hydrogen-exploding thing, probably.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.620]   It's very graphical.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:13.620]   And if you've ever enjoyed--
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.220]   there used to be more of this stuff.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.060]   I'll say that.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.220]   There used to be a lot more of that.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.300]   What will happen in the future kind of stuff?
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.980]   They do a great job of documenting that.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.420]   This is a video.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.300]   It's paleo-future.com, by the way.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.340]   This is a video of Apple's gray flannel navigator produced
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.420]   in 19-- have you seen this?
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.420]   Produced in 1988.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.660]   Remember, it's four years into the Mac.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.500]   And it kind of looks like a Mac.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.700]   I don't know if-- let me see if they actually talk it
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.860]   through here, because I've got the video,
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.580]   but it may not-- I don't know if it's got talking.
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.820]   It's got music.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:56.020]   I was late at night in there.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.700]   The bar was closed.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.300]   I pulled out my Mac.
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.220]   Oh, he's-- oh.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.140]   Missed me?
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.860]   He's talking to his fish.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.260]   He's one of those cutesy videos.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.900]   You have 11 messages.
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.540]   This is his Mac.
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:15.180]   He's looking at-- opens a window, types his password.
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:15.940]   And here's the message.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.140]   Just wait a minute.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.780]   This looks a lot like the iPhone.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.300]   It's got random access messages.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.140]   He's Charlie about Maxwell's proposal.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.380]   This can wait.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.340]   He sounds like Merlin.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.660]   It's Karen.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.740]   I realize you've been through it.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.660]   Now, random access voicemail.
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.140]   1988.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.020]   Ideally.
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:43.700]   It only took them nine years, 10 years, 19 years.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.220]   My math's not very good.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.660]   To get this out there.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.140]   That's kind of--
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.820]   This culture, everyone will be able to do a arithmetic.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.100]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.780]   Meaching.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.380]   If you enjoy that stuff, Leo, there's
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.740]   a great new book out called Where's My Jet Pack that I just
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.380]   picked up.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.700]   Have you seen this book yet?
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.500]   No, I want a jet pack.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.380]   And it's this really fun, very--
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.420]   the writing is wonderful.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.820]   And it's just this book about all the future that never
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.660]   happened and kind of explaining what almost happened,
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.540]   what didn't happen, why things didn't happen.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.780]   Like literally, why we don't have jet packs
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.020]   and why we don't have moving sidewalks and all the stuff
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.460]   that we all thought we would have by now.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.860]   It makes you not want to make predictions.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.300]   Well, it's frustrating.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.660]   I mean, it seems like there's all this stuff you don't need.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.540]   And I know that every time I go to SFO
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.180]   and I go to the United Terminal and I get the moving sidewalk,
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.620]   I think to myself.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:36.140]   Wow.
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.500]   This is something I could use.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.140]   Why did this happen everywhere?
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.540]   What was it the roads must roll?
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.020]   It was a Heinlein short story.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.060]   All about the moving sidewalks, but then there's a strike
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.380]   and there's a sudden--
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.300]   the sidewalks stop suddenly in the horror of it all.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:57.060]   And that may have done a lot to kill the idea.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.220]   Silverlight will not arrive--
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.020]   will arrive on Intel Max, but Microsoft,
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.860]   Inc. will make it on a power PC.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.540]   Isn't it funny that Microsoft's going
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.220]   to be the one that starts pulling the plug?
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.220]   This is the Microsoft version of Flash kind of thing.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.900]   That's going to be huge.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.220]   Yeah, we're on the edge of our seats for that one.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.420]   I know I am.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.460]   OK, never mind.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.300]   I'm sorry I brought it up.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.580]   And by the way, they got this great color scheme.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.980]   It's going to be brown.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:24.740]   Well, of course.
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:26.380]   Or pink.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:26.740]   Or pink.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.580]   Hey, that's not bad.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.140]   We'll take that.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.500]   Pink soon is apparently selling pretty well.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.340]   I hear they sold a million units.
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:35.060]   Or they will by June 2010.
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.340]   About eight of them were brown.
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.060]   The other point on that million units
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:40.900]   is they're not clear and I bet you anything
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.140]   that they don't say whether it's delivered to retail
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:46.260]   or delivered to end users.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:49.820]   It's almost undoubtedly like the cassello records
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.460]   where they sold a whole bunch of them.
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:52.700]   But then they went straight into cutout.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:53.220]   Right.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.220]   Nobody actually bought them.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:55.740]   Interesting.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.820]   Seven predictions for WWDC, the World Wide Developers
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.340]   Conference, which is just two weeks off.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.220]   This is from applegazette.com.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.060]   Number one, multi-touch and leopard.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.940]   That's the cool touch navigation in the iPhone.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.540]   Let's hope so.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.380]   You think so?
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.700]   We've been talking about that a little bit.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.700]   It'd be great if they did it.
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:16.180]   But they don't have the screens to do it.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.900]   Well, that could be part of the announcement
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.340]   we're going to hear on the MacBook Pro for instance.
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:20.860]   Wow.
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:22.140]   That would really make me angry.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.580]   But you know what?
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.260]   You think you've got to be careful about how fast you
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.420]   innovate because of all the people who bought the MacBook
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.860]   Pro last month?
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.420]   Apparently not.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.060]   Since when has Apple been concerned about that?
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.580]   Well, in a way, I have to commend them for that.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.820]   It sure cost me a lot of money.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.980]   I just-- my iPod died.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.100]   So I know there's going to be a new iPod any minute now,
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.140]   but I don't have an iPod.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.580]   So I had to go out and buy an iPod.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.100]   What's the market on eBay like for iPods?
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.860]   Is that-- is there-- you're just better off to just
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:57.380]   buy a new one?
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:00.700]   Oh, I wasn't going to buy somebody else's used iPod.
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:01.620]   You know, you never know.
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:02.180]   You're in interest.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.540]   Could be loaded up with the Greenwood.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.020]   You might want to give it a shot.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.820]   You know, this iPod has a bunch of bike and music on it.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.380]   8 plus plus plus.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.460]   We're definitely buying again.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:19.340]   New GUI for OS 10.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.020]   Are we ready to abandon Aqua?
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.140]   Aqua?
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:23.980]   I'm just learning it.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.060]   What do you mean?
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.340]   So I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.500]   Apple's not notorious for changing their GUI fast.
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:32.420]   That's prediction?
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:32.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.140]   I'm reading the predictions.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:39.140]   New-- number three, new iLife with iTunes HD.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.500]   Now that I'd like.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.780]   Mm, that would be good.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.140]   We need high def, don't we?
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.420]   What do you think about that, Scott?
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.660]   I'm going to call BS on that.
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:46.660]   What do you think of that?
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.540]   Well, I think we're going to get the new iLife for sure.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:51.660]   I don't think that we're going to get the HD.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.900]   I think we're going to get the new iLife suite because it's
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:54.780]   way overdue.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.060]   Well, no, but wasn't that tied to Leopard?
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.220]   Wasn't that what's going to happen?
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:59.260]   That's why it's overdue.
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:00.460]   We're waiting for Leopard.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.780]   So they'll ship it in October.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:02.900]   It'll be iLife 2008.
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.580]   There will never have been an iLife 2007.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.340]   Exactly.
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.700]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.420]   I have a statement.
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:08.420]   But you know what?
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.660]   The good news is, my podcasting with GarageBand 3 titles
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.540]   still got legs.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.980]   All the authors are happy.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:17.220]   Happy, happy.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.580]   I've mentioned this to you before, Leo.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.420]   But I have a stake in the ground on the HD thing.
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.980]   And I would love to be proven wrong because thanks
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:26.380]   to people like Alex and Scott, I now
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.660]   am increasingly ruined about the image of non-HD content.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.700]   But I think it's going to-- I think it's a user experience
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.300]   issue.
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.620]   I mean, I have to say--
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.380]   Because it's to the files are too big and too slow.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:41.820]   Somebody comes home with their new Apple TV with iTunes HD.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:46.660]   They plug it in on their whatever home DSL or God forbid
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.340]   dial up and say, oh, great.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:53.220]   I want to go get weekend with Bernie.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.140]   And it takes three days to download or whatever.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.420]   Best news ever.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.700]   That's because it took Bernie three days to download.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.380]   You guys really think that my--
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:04.340]   It put glasses on him.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:05.220]   So it looked like he was--
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:05.900]   I know.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.820]   He looks like my dad.
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.140]   Exactly.
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.460]   I'm sure your dad loves that.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.100]   He's a little more live right now.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:13.460]   I know.
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.900]   Just that if you had the kind of-- it's not even an edge user
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.420]   at that point.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.980]   That's somebody who's getting it for Christmas and plugs it in
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.380]   and goes, OK, where's my Bernie?
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.740]   And it's going to take a good long time to--
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:25.340]   I disagree.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:29.180]   Because currently, the Xbox 360 offers HD movies and download.
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.300]   Yeah, it takes--
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.260]   Well, it takes hours.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.940]   I mean, it probably takes all my.
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.260]   I don't hear anybody complaining about it.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:35.860]   And it sure looks great.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.980]   I think it's probably--
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.580]   Because what Merlin said, it's not
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.940]   likely to be mandatory.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.500]   It might be something you can switch on if they're going to do it.
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.540]   But I think Merlin's right.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:47.180]   I just think the claim to fame with the whole iPod iTunes
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.340]   thing is that Aunt Fay can plug it in and it works.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.500]   I think that that's the reason not to do it.
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.300]   I think that they know consumers want it.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.740]   They know that Amanda's there.
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.100]   They know that a class of consumers will put up with it.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:04.380]   They probably would offer both versions just as they do on Xbox
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:04.380]   marketplace.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:05.620]   I think they did.
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.260]   But I think there's even-- there's
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.900]   might be a different issue, which is will the movie companies
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:10.740]   allow it?
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:11.260]   There you go.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:11.780]   That's--
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:12.980]   They're going to do it, though.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.380]   I have the title that they should launch with.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.700]   Not my weekend with Bernie?
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.500]   Well, actually, it was Bernie, too.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.700]   A lot of people feel it's like the Godfather, too.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:22.700]   It's actually--
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:23.100]   The better.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.820]   --quizually, actually it's been on the original.
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:25.820]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.380]   Has a lot more El Niri in it.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.620]   No, I think what they need to start with,
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.300]   they need to go out and they need to get a hold of the BBC
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.940]   Planet Earth series, Nary to my rich and extra diamond
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.460]   burrow, and they need to put that out.
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.540]   Because I'll tell you, I had the HD.
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.540]   I watched the Battle Star, the Galactic guy in HD.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.220]   And I was like, sopranos.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.140]   And it was good.
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:43.620]   It was fun.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:44.660]   It was nice.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.740]   Then I watched Planet Earth.
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.140]   And you saw Real HD?
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.140]   Oh, wow.
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:49.780]   Completely.
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:52.500]   It's not only is it the best nature show I've ever seen,
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.820]   but the stuff that they do with camera work and everything
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:56.060]   in that is just-- this is the stuff
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.660]   that they should be running at Costco.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.100]   Did you get that on DVD or how did you get that?
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.100]   Let's see.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.100]   Yeah, DVD.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:09.180]   Actually, it's running on the HDNet on your TV right now.
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:11.460]   But you can also get it on DVD.
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:12.420]   Often Netflix it.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:12.940]   That's cool.
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:13.580]   Outstanding.
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.660]   That would be a pick for me.
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.940]   Go find Planet Earth.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.500]   It's unbelievable.
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:20.220]   Planet Earth by the BBC.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.700]   Yeah, and get the English version.
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:23.300]   The non-Sagorni Weaver version.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.500]   The one that actually has Richard Attenborough.
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.340]   It's amazing.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.780]   Oh, see, that's dumb.
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.500]   They replaced him with--
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.060]   that's stupid.
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.740]   They didn't want to pay that big Attenborough money.
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.260]   They knew that was going to really run into series.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.900]   I have to apologize, by the way, for confusing David McCullough
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.780]   with David Attenborough yesterday.
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:38.300]   Right.
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:38.780]   Last week.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.580]   Yeah, a little spy action there going on.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:41.940]   I know the difference.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.260]   That's the Truman biography.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.940]   Truman, yeah.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.900]   And the one that I really love was the John Adams--
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.700]   that was the book that I listened to on Audible,
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:50.940]   the John Adams biography.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:54.660]   Read by David McCullough was just excellent.
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:58.540]   But you could confuse it too, because they're both primarily
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.420]   known for their academics and their writing.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.940]   And yet they turn out to be incredible readers, both of them.
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.700]   They really are excellent narrators.
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:09.900]   Well, into my early 20s, I continued to confuse Seals
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.940]   and Croft with Sitt and Marty Croft.
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.900]   HR Puff and Stuff versus--
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:15.820]   I'm in, girl.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.460]   It was very confusing.
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.220]   I'm a dream.
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:21.620]   So I'm looking for Battlefield Earth, is that it?
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:23.020]   Yeah, right.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.460]   OK, now in a different way, that is one of the all-time greatest
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:25.900]   movies ever.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.260]   Is that the John Dravolta one?
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:27.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.180]   You know what?
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.860]   I have to tell you, I enjoyed that movie.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:32.260]   Well, it's one star on Netflix, but I'm getting it.
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.700]   You should get a smaller bong.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:39.060]   I've never seen it, so I'm going to--
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:40.420]   Oh, it's not a good time.
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.980]   I thought it was one of those things that's so bad, it's good.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.460]   Totally is.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.660]   OK, so what is it, Planet Earth?
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.500]   Planet Earth.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.380]   But get the BBC version.
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.460]   No, check myself.
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.980]   Planet Earth, and it was on the BBC.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.020]   And it's running right now on it.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:53.780]   Oh, yeah, I see it.
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.020]   I see it here.
[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.140]   Visions of the Earth.
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.060]   You got HD.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:57.580]   You got HD.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.700]   Add a subscription on your Tivo.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:06.500]   So this is the groundbreaking planet Earth series
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.300]   continues with North America.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.580]   OK, so they have each one.
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.300]   It's on a different disk.
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.540]   But that'd be great.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.180]   And then the complete collection--
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.340]   The complete collection for disk series, complete collection.
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:20.420]   But the question is, wow, $25 million budget.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:21.620]   Wow.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.460]   They spent 600 hours on one shoot.
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.100]   On one shoot trying to get these birds of paradise
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.140]   in, I think, was Papua New Guinea.
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:31.060]   They spent, I think, was 600 hours on one shoot.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:31.580]   Oh, I got it.
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.260]   Do they have that in--
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:33.860]   I got a buy-up.
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.060]   I saw it at Costco for $58 American,
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.580]   and it's a pretty-- it's a multi-disk set.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.300]   In fact, let's say that's the one I got.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.140]   It's--
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.620]   I'm not saying that.
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:48.020]   It's a multi-disk series, and they're-- yeah, it's a great--
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.420]   There's a blue-ray disk in there.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.580]   Ah, sure.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.460]   No, I think it's not.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.460]   It's not?
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.460]   I'll check the Amazon--
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.260]   But is that the-- but I'm going to check Amazon right now.
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.260]   But is that the BBC version or the Sigourney Weaver?
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.140]   It absolutely is.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.700]   And if you want to taste it, this, you can't--
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.340]   Complete BBC series.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:05.460]   I see it right here.
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.580]   At a rat hole, they talk with one of the directors, fresh air.
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:11.020]   But this is not HD DVD and 1HD.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:11.660]   Yes, it is.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:12.540]   Look at the second entry.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:13.940]   Search for Planet Earth on Amazon.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:14.460]   OK.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.340]   Complete BBC series.
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.740]   It's a blue-ray and HD.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.580]   It's $67 on HD or blue-ray.
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.500]   [GASPS]
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.100]   Amazon Prime.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.060]   Oh, Prime.
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:24.940]   Two-day, one click.
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.020]   It'll be here Friday.
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:30.980]   I think Amazon just should start investing in wine,
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:34.180]   because I'm pretty convinced that wine plus Amazon Prime
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.540]   is what's going to put me in the poor house.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.260]   You know what I'm doing with Amazon Prime now?
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:39.260]   I get toilet paper.
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:40.220]   That's $10.50 in.
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.740]   I'm ordering pink-fluid disks.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:42.980]   I don't want it.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:43.500]   I know.
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:43.980]   Just click.
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.460]   It's one click.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.180]   I don't know what I ordered, but I ordered it.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.780]   It'll be here today, after tomorrow.
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.300]   The next day, I wake up and see the things that I've ordered.
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:50.980]   Isn't it fun?
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.260]   I could be trouble.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.180]   I ordered toilet paper this way.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.140]   Oh, I got paper towels.
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:55.980]   Paper towels.
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:56.660]   You know they have this--
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:57.300]   You really did?
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:57.860]   Yeah, they have this--
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.780]   It's the most embarrassing thing I've ever done in my life.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.740]   They have this new subscription thing.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.020]   Every three months, bring me a case of paper towels.
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.380]   It's the greatest thing.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:07.300]   Wait, you guys are getting this Amazon?
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:07.660]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.700]   Amazon is like a new thing.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.940]   It's in beta.
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:10.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:11.460]   It's just--
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.460]   It's very slightly different.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.420]   They put a bunch of paper on a truck in Nevada.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.740]   Drive it to San Francisco, and then drop the paper off at my house.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:21.500]   But we've already paid shipping because we paid the $75 for Amazon Prime.
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.940]   Al Gore would not like that.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:24.460]   And--
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.300]   Well, you can get seventh generation paper towels.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.300]   You know, guys, I hate to tell you--
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.140]   Tell me paper towel with a carbon credit.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.100]   There's this company called Buy.com.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.500]   You don't have to pay any sales tax or any shipping.
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:35.380]   That's where I get my--
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.780]   I'm not paying sales tax or shipping because I paid for Prime,
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.260]   so it's got too date-free.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.940]   You're picking up the sales tax later at tax time.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.940]   You go through your receipts.
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:43.940]   All right.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.340]   I do have to make sure I put that in my IRS or my estate form.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.340]   Because as you know--
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.460]   They don't ask for sales tax?
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:50.460]   Not an Amazon.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.420]   That's actually the whole battle going on right now in the Congress.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:54.420]   Oh, you know what?
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   They charge me sales tax because I have a Washington domicine.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.340]   That's why you're in Seattle.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.180]   But in California, they don't.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:06.420]   However, the state of California does require and request that you actually add it to your
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.420]   form.
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:11.060]   I think this all out in post, right, Leo?
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:15.740]   No, I never ordered anything, actually.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.900]   Hey, there's a new thing that just popped up on my Skype.
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:23.580]   It says Agent Wilson from the IRS would like to speak to Merlin.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.860]   And now this brief, David Attenborough moment.
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:33.700]   Ooh, that's pretty.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:46.660]   A planet rotating in space.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:50.060]   I'm sick of me, either.
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.660]   I'm sick of only Weaver.
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:56.660]   And if you hate aliens as much as I do, you'll love this waterfall.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:58.260]   Come on, fuck.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.500]   Yeah, look at it.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.500]   It's all music.
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.500]   I want to hear Andrew.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:07.100]   It's dramatic music.
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.860]   So is the home movie like that?
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.660]   No, it's a one is Travolta come in.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:16.460]   It is amazing how quickly that you are able to get things shipped to you, Leo.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.540]   Yes, it's talking about that.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:19.540]   I'll tell you.
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:20.540]   Amazon unbox for that.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:22.180]   BBC Prime.
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.460]   I mean, Amazon Prime.
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:28.020]   I mean, you guys, it was 75 bucks and you get it within a few seconds.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:29.020]   Isn't that great?
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.020]   Isn't that great?
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.020]   That is pretty impressive.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.260]   You want to watch the L word?
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:34.260]   Okay.
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:35.260]   Absolutely.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.780]   Moving on.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:43.980]   More speculation on WWDC again from the Apple Gazette.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.980]   Blue Ray support.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:46.980]   Ooh.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:47.980]   Blue Ray support.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:48.980]   What do you think?
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.480]   I think it's crazy, but I'd love for them to do it.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.780]   Apple's already said they're going to support Blu Ray.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:54.260]   What does Blu Ray support have?
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:57.820]   The device already, you need a Blu Ray drive.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.820]   A drive.
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.060]   And this is a little trickier.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:06.980]   If you want to watch Blu Ray movies, you need to support HDCP.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:12.860]   And I think that's why you haven't seen Blu Ray readers in any Apple product.
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:13.860]   Hmm.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.980]   Because Vista supports it, of course.
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:22.140]   But Apple has yet to put that copy protection junk in there.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.740]   Unless they haven't, didn't tell us.
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:28.060]   Leopard iPhone integration number five.
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:29.060]   Yeah, right.
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.140]   Number six, new Mac minis and MacBook Pros.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.140]   We just talked about that.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.340]   And number seven, one more thing.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.340]   This is his one more thing.
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.900]   I like it.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:38.900]   When are we going to get it?
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:43.580]   The ultra portable iMac with a multi touch screen.
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.980]   Oh, ultra portable.
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:48.060]   Oh, I want one.
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:49.780]   You've had one for a long time.
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:50.780]   It's called the Newton.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:52.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.580]   A color Newton would be good.
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.740]   I should add that to my predictions.
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.140]   I think it's a funny thing.
[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:59.140]   A color Newton.
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.140]   I got a Newton.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.140]   Justine, you got to see it.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.140]   It's so great.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.140]   You do.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.140]   I'm running Apache on it.
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.660]   It's actually how Twitter TV is served.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:08.660]   Oh, right.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.660]   By end.
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:10.660]   I had Newton.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.660]   That's great.
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:13.660]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.860]   Is your single device a trio, Justine?
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:17.860]   Yes.
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:18.860]   That's your one.
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.260]   You carry one thing you carry around with you.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.260]   Definitely.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.260]   That and now Sony Bio laptop.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.060]   But can I ask you a question, Justine?
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:27.060]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:30.580]   Have any problems sinking your trio with your Mac?
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.580]   I don't.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.180]   Surprisingly, I think I'm the only person in the world that has never had any problems
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.180]   with this trio.
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.580]   Oh, no, no, I have any problems either.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.540]   Is it a palm or windows?
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.780]   Yeah, it's a palm.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.780]   Palm sinks fine with the Mac.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.780]   Mm-hmm.
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.780]   It doesn't?
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:45.780]   Unless you threw it in the San Francisco Bay.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.780]   Yeah, it does.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.780]   It doesn't sink as well.
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.420]   It didn't sink with mine.
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.780]   It sank all the way to the bottom is where it sank.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.780]   Oh.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:56.580]   I tell you what, that was the best day of my life getting rid of that thing.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.340]   So what do you use now?
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:03.380]   I'm just using the cheapest Verizon phone they got until it comes time to get my iPhone.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.380]   That's a way to do it.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.380]   I'm a little bit.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:09.380]   But you know, I said I just want a regular phone and they still sold me a thing that's
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.380]   got a can opener and everything else in it.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.660]   But it's just a little, I don't even know what kind it is.
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.460]   I paid 240 bucks for it.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.020]   Wow, I don't think that's their cheapest one.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.500]   Well, it is because see, I was, they were like, "Would you like to extend your contract
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.500]   for 22 years?"
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.500]   Oh, sure.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500]   Oh.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.500]   No, thanks.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.500]   I'll just pay for the phone.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.460]   And I'm going to actually keep it as a backup.
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.420]   Maybe give it to Aunt Fay, who knows.
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:38.540]   And when the iPhone comes, I'm going to find out if Singular can provide me with decent
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:39.540]   service.
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.220]   That's my biggest fear about switching.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.820]   Well, what is it you fear, Scott?
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.140]   I fear coverage.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.140]   I fear coverage lapses.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.140]   His biggest fear.
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.140]   I'm here to tell you.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:55.480]   I was in Gurneville last week by the Russian River and Singular was the only system that
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.380]   would work at all.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.820]   Now I know you don't spend a lot of time in Gurneville.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.540]   I don't know what the heck Gurneville is.
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.540]   Oh.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:05.540]   If you start smelling a monkey house, just go look for it.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.060]   Okay, we're going to have to edit that out.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.900]   It's a very rural wine country area.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:13.500]   Are you mocking the Bohemian Club?
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.500]   Where's the monkey house?
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.500]   Oh, no.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.500]   It's just that kind of, you know, rural sort of.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.500]   It does.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.500]   That's where I live.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:24.420]   And twice a year, twice a year it gets a little fragrant, a little pungent because--
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.640]   Sure, it's probably like the monkey house beyond it.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.040]   Well, it's Derry's.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.040]   It's Derry's.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.040]   We call it Derry Air.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.880]   Yeah, first of all, we've got a little bit of that.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.320]   Yeah, it's a little Derry Air.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.240]   So you have you have you singular?
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.080]   No, but it was really funny.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:41.880]   I mean, it's conventional wisdom in there, like the woman that checked us into the hotel
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.880]   of our friends.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.120]   I got five bars right here in Petaluma.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120]   And you're on singular?
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.640]   Well, I have several, but I'm looking at my singular right now.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640]   I have several.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.560]   I have several phones.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.560]   Well, I just--
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.400]   I am interested to see how the Singular service is because I really do.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.060]   I don't want to switch because I don't have that much issues with that many issues,
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.540]   rather, with Sprint.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.540]   Sprint's good.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.980]   And they have fast 3G.
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:02.980]   Yeah, they do.
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:03.980]   So--
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:04.980]   I haven't sprinted for a phone pair.
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.980]   It's like having Kaiser for your medical care.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.140]   It's like you're fine as long as nothing ever goes wrong.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.140]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:15.740]   Are you saying their support is not fine?
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.380]   I would say their support is not fine.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:18.380]   No, that's true.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:19.380]   You know what?
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:23.740]   They randomly sent me another phone and they randomly like added on another line.
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.940]   And they're like, well, you requested this, didn't you?
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.940]   Really?
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:27.940]   Actually, no, I didn't.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:28.940]   But thank you.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:29.940]   Wow, that's wild.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.020]   And what's kind of weird?
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:36.260]   Well, I hope that singular/AT&T does a good job.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.340]   And if they do, then that will make everything fine.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.940]   I have to admit, my Verizon service has been very good.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.020]   I haven't had any drop calls.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.020]   I've had service anywhere.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.020]   I've wanted it.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:48.220]   So that is problematic for me to think about the switch.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.700]   So but I mean, you've cited this concern numerous times.
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.700]   And the concern is primarily a coverage thing.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.980]   It's not a service thing.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.260]   It's mostly you just want to make sure that when you travel, you'll have coverage.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.500]   Well, I have had some unfortunate service experiences already.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:06.980]   I did a test enrollment with Singular as part of an article I'm writing and then canceled
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.780]   it to see what the customer service was like.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.300]   And some six months later, I'm still getting the bill for the account that I never actually
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.660]   opened.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:21.980]   This is the same level of support one gets from Nikon, which is, you know, we're not
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.620]   happy till you're not happy.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:27.820]   Anyway, I made my concerns clear to them.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.980]   And over time, as you say, Merlin, if you work hard enough, you get the right person.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.540]   Eventually you get someone that cares.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.540]   They take care of it.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.700]   And now I got a bill for minus 70 cents last Wednesday, which I'm not quite sure what that
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.700]   was all about.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.620]   Probably cost $4 to send it to me.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:46.300]   But apparently they owe me 70 cents for a transaction in which no money changed hands.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.300]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.100]   Merlin might start making it's a serious dose soon.
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.900]   Merlin, who is the mac-a-lope?
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.180]   Come on, tell us.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.180]   We know it's Merlin.
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.180]   Tell him the truth.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.180]   He's very funny.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:02.140]   I'm just reading his posting from last week, "I Flop."
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:04.860]   He's talking about seeking out for Todd Sullivan.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.700]   It sure does sound like Merlin, actually.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:11.020]   A lot of people thought it was John Gruber, but I think John has said that it's not him.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.140]   John hates the rot so much.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:17.260]   That was my first reaction, but it could be that the rot is spreading.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:20.740]   If we have the mac-a-lope on, we're going to need to do some kind of sophisticated,
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.180]   honest, disguising thing.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.180]   Has anybody seen Merlin and the mac-a-lope in the same?
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.740]   I just have to read this.
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:27.740]   I Flop.
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:33.540]   Seeking out for Todd Sullivan, he says, "It's appropriate that your headshot shows you
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:39.100]   standing in a forest, which you likely cannot see for all those damn trees."
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:43.140]   He says, "The iPhone, Apple's first Flop."
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.420]   The mac-a-lope responds, "Apple's first Flop?
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:48.100]   Wow, you really are quite the student of Apple, aren't you?
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:51.340]   The mac-a-lope is sure we're going to be treated as some top-notch analysis."
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:55.320]   He quotes, goes on to quote, "I do not want to have to turn off my music to get a phone
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.020]   call to which the mac-a-lope replies.
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.380]   I do not want to be able to hear the people I'm talking to."
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.380]   Well, okay.
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:04.220]   Seems a little strange to the mac-a-lope, but different strokes for different folks.
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:07.620]   Note to Sullivan, the iPhone automatically lowers the music volume when you can get a
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.620]   call.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.580]   Okay, don't you, Merlin?
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.860]   If I did know the mac-a-lope, I wouldn't be able to say.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:16.260]   So for all of her steak, let's just get the mac-a-lope on here.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.260]   It is funny.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.260]   We should have them on.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.260]   All right, next show, mac-a-lope.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:20.260]   Next show.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.700]   All right, I will see what I can do.
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:23.700]   We have a system with the...
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:24.700]   I can process his voice.
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:25.700]   We have a blind drop.
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:26.700]   We have a blind drop.
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:27.700]   Okay.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.700]   I'll leave a note.
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.860]   I can process his voice so that no one will ever know who it is.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:32.860]   We'll put him on the phone.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.620]   We'll have him on a separate channel.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.940]   You're an awkward show.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:36.940]   Like, "Gee, let's...
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.940]   You get a secret line.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.940]   That's something you have a...
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.940]   A secure line.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.940]   I do have a secure line.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:41.940]   I have an encoded line with a red phone.
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:42.940]   But you passed along to the mac-a-lope.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.940]   Well, you know, I have heard that the mac-a-lope is actually deep throat.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.260]   He's dead.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.180]   I just think he's a very funny writer.
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.300]   Well, Matt, in terms of getting him on the show then, huh?
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.460]   We couldn't be Merlin.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.700]   He has too many blogs already.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:58.860]   He couldn't have another blog.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.860]   Could scare...
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.860]   From your mouth, who could...
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:01.860]   God's ear.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:02.860]   It's somebody...
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.020]   It's somebody we know, though.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.020]   You know it is.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.020]   All right.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.020]   Well, here's the real question, Leo.
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:08.900]   You've seen that phone guy.
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:09.900]   And the mac-a-lope.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:10.900]   And the same time.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.700]   It does seem too bad.
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:13.700]   Interesting.
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:14.700]   So, let's...
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.980]   Now, Justine, we have a little tradition here.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:22.540]   We call Jump the surprise guest host.
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:28.380]   In which we tell you and give you just a few minutes to come up with a Mac pick of the
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:31.460]   week, a program that you use or you like.
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:32.780]   So think about that.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.620]   I won't put you on the spot quite yet.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.620]   Okay.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.620]   I'll think about it.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:41.260]   Because we're going to start today with Mr. Merlin Mann.
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:43.420]   I have two half picks.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:48.540]   Because one of them is a pick you already made and the other is a website.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:54.140]   My pick in which I'm giving my thumbs up alongside Leo's is one password.
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.780]   Oh, isn't it great?
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.900]   I believe this is a pick of the week for you a month or two ago.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.900]   Yes.
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:03.100]   And because I don't actually listen to what all of you guys are saying, well, we do the
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:05.900]   podcast, I don't think I'd process what you said.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.660]   It's a really handy application.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:15.060]   What it does is it's using keychain, which you already used to kind of take care of all
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.060]   your passwords.
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.900]   But it's a smarter way of dealing with passwords inside of your browser.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:24.700]   So Safari, OmniWeb, Firefox, whatever it is that you use.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.540]   In my experience, it's worked on three different or four different browsers.
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:30.540]   Firefox, Flock, Safari and OmniWeb.
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:36.660]   And what it does is it gets real smart about knowing what pages to associate with which
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:37.860]   logins.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:42.740]   And it automatically will put that information in for you and auto submit it.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:46.700]   And this is something that's been around on Firefox for a while, but you haven't had
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.300]   with the Mac.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:52.860]   And it's also got some new features that used to work great and explorer that have not been
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:56.420]   as great in Safari, believe it or not, which is stuff like filling out profiles.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:00.300]   So you can fill out a profile for your real self filling out.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.340]   You can have many profiles too, which is nice.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.340]   Exactly.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:11.300]   You can have this phony baloney, my fake identity, Thor Stenson Finlanson.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.300]   Thor Stenson Finlanson.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:13.300]   Thor Stenson Finlanson.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.300]   That's you.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.300]   That's me.
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:18.540]   Because I heard on a good story that that's the Macelope.
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:19.540]   Thank you.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:20.540]   I was just about to point that out.
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:21.540]   Thor Stenson Finlanson.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:26.820]   Thor Stenson Finlanson, it's a reference to the Hudsucker property.
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:28.900]   That's where I heard that name before.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.100]   Makeup, but you can make up this totally thick identity.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:35.020]   So if you want like blah, blah information for those like enter your personal information
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:38.780]   and download this extensive white paper, you can have all that crap be fake information.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:42.340]   I just wish it worked with my pick of the week this week.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.820]   Ooh, do you want to jump in here?
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.300]   Well, no, do your website.
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:47.300]   And then I'll mention mine.
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.820]   Well, the other one, this is a website.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.180]   So anyway, that's one password.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.780]   And where does that live, Leo?
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:54.820]   I think it's the number one password.com.
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:56.460]   But let me just try it real.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:59.260]   Yeah, number one, P-A-S-S-W-D.
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:00.260]   Notcom.
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.260]   So drop the last vowels.
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.620]   And it's the typical like I think it's 30 bucks.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.620]   Worth it.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.620]   Worth it.
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.620]   Worth it.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.620]   You can try it for free and I did for a while.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:12.900]   But almost to me, I bought it I think within the first few hours.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:13.900]   Oh, no, I bought it.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:18.380]   And just to let you know, of course, if you're using anything like that Mac sync, it'll sync
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.580]   up your keychains for you.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.300]   So you don't lose this from machine to machine.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.300]   I forgot the other one.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.300]   The generating passwords.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.300]   This is so great.
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.300]   This is actually the thing I love.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:28.460]   Now, keychain will do this, but this is so much easier.
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:29.460]   It's hard to get this.
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.460]   This is so much easier.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:34.100]   You can have a generate a ginormous password for you.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.780]   Very complex, hard to hack password.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:42.540]   This is also nice because it will also fill in the dot ht access and the other weird
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.780]   password forms that are not actually on the web.
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:48.020]   Yeah, like Apache Realms, all that stuff that will remember all that crap for you.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.820]   And I should say it'll remember multiples of all of these.
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:54.340]   So if you're using several logins, like for like the same like type pad or whatever,
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:55.860]   it'll remember all of those.
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.820]   So anyway, let's rerun, but it's a good one.
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.900]   You just want to replace my quote on the front page of the site.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:02.900]   Oh, look at you.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.900]   Look at the week.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.900]   You know, I will.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:08.900]   The Nasei Leel Report and Merlin Man.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.660]   Me too, says Merlin Man.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.660]   Yeah, you know, that's even better.
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:13.660]   Me too.
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:14.660]   It's a typically uncreated fit.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:16.180]   Merlin Man agrees with someone.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:18.740]   It's a typically uncreated fit.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.380]   What's the website?
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:21.380]   Doodle.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.380]   I don't know.
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.020]   Doodle dot C H. I wrote about this before on 43 photos.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.660]   Oh, it's the Swiss Doodle.
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.660]   Swiss Doodle.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.660]   I wrote about it again today.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.500]   Doodle dot C H and it does one thing.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.500]   How does it work?
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:34.500]   Okay.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.500]   So here's the way it works.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.500]   You've got a meeting or a call.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.060]   Actually, Leo, this would be perfect for scheduling when the new Mac work.
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:41.700]   How many times has this happened to you?
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:42.700]   Oh.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:47.100]   You've got 10 people that you need to get together, whether it's dinner or what have
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.780]   you, and you sit there and you play email secretary for --
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:51.780]   Oh, I love this.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.940]   -- you go out and say, "Here's your choice."
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:54.940]   -- There's two choices.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:55.940]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:56.940]   -- or here's 15 times.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:57.940]   You put all of this out.
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.940]   You send it to everybody who needs to.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:03.700]   They go in and they vote for which ones they want for a meeting.
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:08.100]   And it compiles all this for you and then comes up with the optimal date and time.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.820]   Now you could use it for regular polls too.
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:10.820]   I mean, it could be --
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.700]   Yeah, and they do polls as well.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.020]   They do real polls as well.
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:16.260]   But, you know, a lot of people know you can do this and out look.
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.820]   Well, I don't have out look.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.260]   And this is really low-fi.
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:20.260]   It's really simple.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:23.420]   And if you've ever been a project manager or a make-believe project manager and you've
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:28.180]   had to try and get 10 or 15 people in the same place at the same time, it's a crazy-making
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.180]   enterprise.
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:30.180]   So, doodle.ch.
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:31.180]   It's free.
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:37.620]   And if you really want to have fun with your correspondence, you could do it in Italian.
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.380]   The Swiss are a polyglot people.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:40.380]   They do.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:43.780]   They're between the Germany, the Italy, and --
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.780]   It looks like Romanian.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:46.780]   They got a Romanian, or RM.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:47.780]   I guess that's Romanian.
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:51.780]   And so what I wrote about today on the site though is using doodle as this passive-aggressive
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.780]   way to jumpstart a project.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.780]   Great idea.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.820]   So if you've had a project that's kind of gone fallow for whatever reason, use doodle
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.780]   to say that people, "Hey, will we do it like a five minute or ten minute check-on?"
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.780]   I'm going to do this.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:05.300]   I'm going to do this with the floss weekly, which is basically moribund because -- you know,
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.180]   hey, you know, so Krista Bona is very busy.
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.180]   He's very busy.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.420]   So, okay, I understand.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:10.420]   So I'll wait for you.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.420]   He had a baby, blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.420]   Nothing happened.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.420]   Maybe he had an itch to scratch.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:14.420]   He had an itch to scratch.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:15.420]   And he's scrubbing shit.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:16.420]   That's a Scratch.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:17.420]   It is done.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.420]   And now he doesn't want to scratch anymore.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.780]   So I added Mad Dog haul because Mad Dog is great.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.940]   I thought -- and then Mad Dog says, "Well, I've got to go to Brazil."
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:26.020]   So now I added Randall Schwartz.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.420]   Randall Schwartz is on a cruise.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.500]   So basically I got three hosts and still no podcast.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.700]   So I'm going to doodle them all and say -- More passive aggression, Leo.
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.700]   That's it.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:36.700]   Doodle will help before that.
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:37.700]   Solve my problem.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.300]   Thank you, Mr. Merlin, man.
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.780]   As usual.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:43.020]   So the only -- you know, I switched to one password.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:44.380]   It works with Safari, works great.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.700]   It works with Firefox, great.
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:48.820]   But I started using Flock more and more.
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.460]   Now I mentioned this last week, but I thought I'd make it my software pick because I don't
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.340]   know if people have tried it lately.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:56.340]   I tried it early on when it was very early beta.
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.860]   It's still in beta.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.660]   It is based on the Firefox engine.
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:01.460]   So it's the Gecko engine.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:05.100]   FLOCK.com.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.820]   Now you sound a little dismissive of it last week, Merlin.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.540]   Is there a reason not to like Flock?
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.540]   A Flock?
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.300]   No, I like Flock fine.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.660]   It's -- I'm trying to remember why it might have sounded dismissive.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:20.420]   Well, I think some people don't like it because it seems like maybe they're trying to commercialize
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.100]   on the Firefox codebase.
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:25.100]   I don't know.
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:29.060]   A number of people, Tara Hunt and Chris Messina, were there and left.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:32.380]   They've gone through a lot of developers and yet I think it's getting better and better
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.380]   and better.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.380]   I really like it.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.380]   It's a Flock.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.460]   First of all, delicious integration.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:40.140]   And that was the reason I use Flicker.
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:43.260]   It's got a Flicker toolbar now.
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.540]   So it's got the ideal Flicker integration.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.980]   And if you're blogging, you can drag the photos from the Flicker toolbar right into
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.180]   your blog.
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:55.180]   It has blog support for most standard blogger and WordPress type blogs.
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.180]   And L.R.P.C.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.180]   It's the XMR P.C. request.
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:02.180]   It also does -- I think it's got the best news reader I've used in there.
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:05.780]   I mean, it's just a really fantastic news reader built in.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:10.100]   It beats Safari in terms of the functionality.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.780]   And it beats many of the Firefox plugins too.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.460]   I think it's just a very, very nice.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.180]   You should try it anyway.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.180]   Well, I --
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:17.180]   I just --
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.180]   I'll let you use Flock.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.180]   I do.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.180]   I do.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:22.180]   I use it pretty much mostly just for blogging and updating stuff to Flicker.
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.180]   Very fast, quick way to do it.
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.180]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:31.540]   I would suggest rerunning your install of OnePassword because I, for one, have a toolbar
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.540]   showing up for one password.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:33.540]   Oh, you do.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.540]   So try rerunning your --
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:39.300]   Actually, oh, another reason of Love OnePassword, if it recognizes Flock, I'm so happy.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.300]   That'll be great.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.300]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:46.020]   If Flock gets better and better, I used it when it first came out and it was buggy and
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.020]   crashed a lot.
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:50.740]   Now, much -- to me, it seems a bit more stable than Firefox, but that's partly because of
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:53.740]   all the extensions I have running on Firefox.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:57.060]   It does all the same things Firefox does, but it does it, I think, in a more -- in a
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:02.900]   Slicker way, and the integration for Flicker, for what -- now, it says you can bookmark
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:06.500]   stuff at -- was it shadows?
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:10.060]   And it's -- I don't know if it's a service that's still around or not.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.060]   Mm.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.060]   I don't know.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.060]   And also set delicious.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.700]   I mean, I think this was -- this is one thing that, freaking out a little bit, was a little
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.220]   unclear to me at first.
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:21.220]   You can set it up so that if I'm not mistaken, you can have your bookmarks automatically
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.540]   stored on the delicious.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.540]   That's right.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:24.540]   Yeah, I'll go to the --
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.140]   The feature -- and this may be what's crashing Firefox.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:30.940]   I use the Google browser sync on Firefox, which is great.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:35.300]   I mean, that means all my bookmarks on all the versions of Firefox I use on all platforms,
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.260]   Windows, Mac, all my computers, it's the same.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.420]   But I think it's a little buggy.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:42.460]   I have to say that using delicious to do this.
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.500]   Now, you're worried about them being public.
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.500]   Is that the --
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:49.980]   Oh, I mean, yeah, just to know what stuff I'm putting out, you know, publicly versus
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:50.980]   locally.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.780]   I think you can -- I -- you know, I haven't played with that.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:53.780]   I think you can control that.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:54.780]   I think you can.
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.820]   One thing we should mention is it's really good looking, at least on my Mac, it's very
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:58.820]   Mac-like.
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:16:59.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:01.820]   Very shiny.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:03.820]   Highly recommend.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:04.820]   That's always good.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:08.500]   Shiny happy flock, FLOCK.com.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:12.860]   You know, I'd say many of you probably have already tried it as I'd had it high, and I
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.500]   would say it's time for another look.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.940]   I'll give it another look, Leo.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.220]   I was not impressed originally by that.
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:18.220]   I wasn't either.
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.220]   It was very crashy.
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:21.220]   I didn't get it.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:26.020]   But now, between the news, the blog postings and the Flickr integration and delicious integration,
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:29.180]   I think they've come a lot closer to something that's very usable.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.980]   I'm glad to see if one pass works with it.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.380]   I'll be very happy.
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.540]   Scott Born, you have a pick.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.540]   I do, but first I have a news item we missed.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:43.180]   We should mention that Apple issued a security update today for QuickTime 7.1.6.
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.180]   Yes, it did.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.180]   It fixes the --
[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:49.940]   Yeah, a little thing that the guys got paid $10,000 to do when they were able to hack
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:54.500]   in through a MacBook Pro by standing on their left foot and scratching their right
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.300]   side three times or something.
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.300]   Anyway, that's something that's --
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.300]   Absolutely right.
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.940]   I neglected to mention that I had to install it this morning.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:01.940]   It came across.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:05.820]   So, my pick is -- this is like an Alex and a half.
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:12.580]   I'm sorry, but it's actually -- I wish there would be a way to get just the thing I want
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:17.800]   out of it for less, but Apple and their infinite wisdom has decided to make soundtrack Pro
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.240]   2 part of the Final Cut suite.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:30.400]   So my pick is Final Cut 2.0, the studio version, because of soundtrack Pro.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:34.840]   Now can I still -- because I was able to get soundtrack Pro stand alone in version 1.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.360]   Does it sell stand alone?
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.360]   Negative.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.520]   That's my thing.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.240]   You got to spend $12,000, $9,000, $8, or whatever to get this.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.200]   And Leo, you know I've been using Pro Tools since version 1.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.600]   We're now in version 7, so I've got a lot invested in Pro Tools, but I have to admit,
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:57.480]   I got my Final Cut studio today and I am tempted to make the permanent switch to soundtrack
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.480]   Pro.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480]   It is extremely cool.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.240]   Number 1, multi-track, finally.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.800]   Number 2, you can do 6 tracks simultaneously.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:11.000]   So you can have 6 different tracks going on with different inputs.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.600]   They've really streamlined the interface.
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.360]   You can even do Dolby 5.1 surround.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:22.040]   So if you're making stuff for Apple TV Merlin, this would be a way to do it if you want to
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.000]   do the whole surround experience.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.680]   And I really like the workflow.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.160]   The UI is gorgeous.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.240]   The bins that you can put data into.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.840]   You can just go get information out of the bin and reuse it because these are not physical
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.840]   connections to media.
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.840]   They're logical.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.000]   So you're working off an EDL, essentially.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.400]   And it's really overkill for broadcasting, but you know, I can't help myself.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.240]   One of my complaints about it, and one of the reasons I stopped using it, was it was
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.200]   kind of sluggish feeling.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.760]   Well, see, this is like a flock thing now.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.920]   Everything you thought you knew about Soundtrack Pro, forget it.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   It's all different now.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:02.800]   No, they came up here and asked me in great detail all the things I hated about it.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.800]   And it sounds like they've responded to those.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.640]   I wish they would send me a copy because now I got to go out and buy Final Cut studio
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.840]   for $1,200 to see.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:16.280]   Yeah, there's a lot of stuff in there that I'm not going to need, but I really like it.
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:22.840]   And I'm very seriously considering making the switch at Panango Productions to this software.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:23.840]   I would love to.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:28.760]   I mean, the only reason I'm still using Windows over here is because for audition.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:34.160]   If you were to use this, I'm pretty sure you would rethink that.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:39.440]   And now let's go to the video blogger, iJustine.tv.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:44.680]   We gave you as much time and I've been watching you click away looking for something fun and
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:45.880]   exciting and cool for us.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.680]   And what have you found?
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.600]   Well, it's not exactly an app, but it kind of is.
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:52.600]   That's fine.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:53.760]   The new Facebook apps.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:54.760]   Are you excited about that?
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.720]   Now, you're actually glad you brought this up because you're a Facebook user.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.720]   I am so excited.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:04.040]   I've started liking Facebook a lot more ever since they started using the GIFs.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.440]   And then I just started using it.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.040]   And now with the information.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.920]   I'm sorry, I can't even talk today.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.320]   When you say using the GIFs, what do you mean?
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.960]   Like the Facebook GIFs, whenever they started selling them for a dollar, that pretty much
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.960]   got me hooked.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   I don't understand.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   What's a GIF?
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.960]   You mean the Facebook image?
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.920]   No, no, no, they have Facebook GIFs.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.920]   Oh, GIFs.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.920]   Oh, you can buy stuff.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.560]   Oh, yeah, you send people stuff.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.000]   You purchased the little images for a dollar.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.160]   I got it.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.840]   Absolutely unnecessary.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.720]   But that's actually when I first started getting interested in it.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.120]   And now they have the open API and everyone started.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.840]   Send me a GIFs, would you?
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:40.840]   I will.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:41.840]   I'll send you one.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:42.840]   So I can see what that's like.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:48.320]   But one of the first things that I really was excited about is the Facebook video.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.160]   So you can just upload directly and you can tag your friends.
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.280]   They're trying to go against YouTube.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   But I'm pretty...
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.280]   I mean, you do a lot of videos.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.280]   It is good as YouTube.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.160]   Yeah, the video quality looks pretty good.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.760]   And the thing that I like is a lot of my friends are in the videos that we create.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.400]   So I'm able to tag them on Facebook.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.640]   And it's pretty much everyone can see who's in the video or...
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.720]   And it will also show up on their mini feet.
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.680]   So that's just more people that will be clicking on it.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.480]   Now what networks are you a part of?
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.040]   Because that seems to be a big part of Facebook.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.040]   What groups you're in?
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.640]   I'm really just in the Pittsburgh network.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.640]   Just that.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.640]   Yeah, that's basically it.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   Okay.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.760]   I'm just in the Petaluma Sonoma...
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:26.960]   Our Sonoma Moran network.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.680]   It's not a big network.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:29.680]   There's just two of us.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:30.680]   Oh.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.680]   No, I'm sure it's bigger than that.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.680]   Sonoma and NAP...
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.680]   I'm sure there's...
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.680]   There are 5,420 Sonoma NAPians.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.120]   Well, I'm definitely going to send you a gift right now.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:44.480]   Okay, because I read about this new API and I'm trying to get it and I'm trying to see...
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.120]   To me, Facebook is just kind of opaque.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.520]   I just don't get it.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.520]   You know what?
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.520]   I thought so too.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.520]   But I'm really excited about this.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.520]   The slogans are on.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.520]   I'm telling you.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:53.520]   You reach a certain age.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.520]   Have you gone red?
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.520]   I know.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.520]   I started flashing red.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.520]   I have to go to Carousel.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.520]   He's a runner.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.320]   Get him.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.520]   So are you saying you're too old to get it, Marlin?
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:09.160]   A lot of what she just said was just completely pops and buzzes to me.
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.120]   I'm lost on a lot of that stuff.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:15.720]   Hank, I mean like Hank last week totally dressed me down about verb, which was the one of those
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.640]   networks I would ever consider joining.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:22.200]   You know, I'm going to have to pay Hank for his appearance on that show.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.520]   We got so much positive feedback from what?
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.480]   He was, of course.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:32.360]   Last week, my 12 and a half year old son, Justin, appeared on the show.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.360]   Oh, really?
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.360]   Oh, that's great.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:38.640]   You set up on Marlin on T9 and variety of other things and like all the young people went,
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.720]   "Yeah, yeah, go Hank."
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.920]   And he's on verb?
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.720]   No, he's a Facebook user.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.720]   I see.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.240]   Actually, I think he's still my space.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.240]   Abby went to...
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.240]   Yes, he's a stick danger.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.240]   Oh, yeah, Ray Danger on that.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.760]   Danger, I'll ask him.
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.800]   And then Abby's gone to Facebook.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.200]   My 15-year-old's gone to Facebook.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.800]   So maybe a generational thing.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.520]   It might be.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:02.080]   And we all folks think that verbs should be "hipper."
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.800]   And so we're trying to pretend how hip we are by using verb.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800]   One of these days.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.600]   I don't know, but Facebook, Heather.
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.880]   Are you still using "I'm in like with you"?
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.480]   I am, yes.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.440]   I'm still an "I'm in like with you" fan.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.800]   It's really cool because actually today, someone called me from there for the first time.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.080]   And this person doesn't have my number or they don't have any other way of contacting
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.240]   me other than through "I'm in like with you."
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.640]   So how do they call you?
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.080]   I guess it's just through their network.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.240]   On their cell phone?
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.960]   They call you on a cell phone?
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:37.120]   What they do is they click the call button on their website and then it calls them back
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.680]   and then calls me.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.080]   So it's kind of weird.
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.280]   See, that's what I don't want to have happen.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.120]   Yeah, that could be a little long.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.480]   I'm going to close that account right away.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:51.760]   The only people that can contact you are the ones that would win your game or if you won
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.760]   theirs.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.440]   So the only person who's won my game is some like 18-year-old guy.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.160]   So I think I'm safe.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.160]   Maybe.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.160]   And I think I'm your contact too.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.160]   You did.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.640]   Yeah, you let me win.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.640]   I did.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.360]   Berlin, do you have any idea?
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.760]   No idea, Scott.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:07.760]   It's all...
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:08.760]   Thank you.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:09.760]   The kids know.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:10.760]   And the kids do.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.120]   So are you bidding on people?
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.120]   How does this work?
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.120]   You play a game.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.120]   You play a game.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.120]   You play from potions.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.120]   What is it?
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:20.960]   Yeah, it's sort of eBay-style bidding for people except you can't get in content.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.960]   I know.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:22.960]   It sounds worse than it is.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.960]   How much does that count on?
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   I don't know why they're just dating.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.920]   So the way that my space or Facebook or verb works is that somebody just says I want
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.560]   to be your friend and you say yes or no to this.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.320]   On I'm like with you, they can't do that.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.880]   You actually, they have to win a game.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.000]   And a game is not really that hard.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.640]   I mean, a game is just complete the sentence, right?
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:42.640]   Sort of.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.640]   Well, it wasn't.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.560]   Actually, the cool thing is, is one of my friends, he did a game that the highest bidder,
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:53.520]   he would donate some sort of amount of money if he got passed like 2,000 points.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.520]   So he donated to two different charities, like $200.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.520]   That's really cool.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.880]   So I mean, it was cool because people were finding random ways that are...
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:04.880]   And you get points by answering questions or by adding a phone.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.400]   I mean, you get points by participating in a site basically.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.560]   He has time to do all this.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.360]   I'm not sure.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.840]   People with cameras on their heads.
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:13.840]   They do, yes.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.120]   If you're wearing a camera on your head, you have time for I'm in like with you.com.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:20.120]   You wouldn't think I'd have time for it as busy as you would.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.120]   I really would.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.200]   Nor would I think you'd have time for World of Warcraft or any of the other pursuits that
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:25.200]   you're involved in.
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.440]   I feel that it's my fiduciary responsibility.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.680]   This is homework for work.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:31.680]   This is what I...
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:32.680]   You're doing it for the kids.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:35.600]   I'm doing it for the kids because if I don't do it, who will?
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.480]   That's kind of how I feel about going to House of Prime Riblio.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.400]   Hey, speaking of which, as president of the horizontal and challenge podcasters of America,
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.240]   I have to become as much prime rib as far as I do.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.840]   I'm going to House of Prime Rib but first I'm going to see if I can have...
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.840]   Maybe we should have a...
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:55.040]   I'm in like with you contest on the House of Prime Rib.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:56.040]   Here we go.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.040]   I'm rib with this.
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:58.680]   Yeah, that'd be fun.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:26:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:00.680]   That would be hilarious.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.840]   I can share my I'm in like with you on my Facebook.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:05.840]   You can.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.840]   So how do I...
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.200]   I don't get how I do that.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.520]   Oh, my photo gallery then goes to Facebook.
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:11.960]   Oh, that was a very interesting...
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.400]   Wow, that was very interesting.
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.880]   So is this the new API?
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:15.880]   Oh.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.360]   Because that was easy.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.440]   I went to I'm in like with you.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.760]   I clicked a button that says click to share on Facebook.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.760]   I said, "Okay."
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:22.760]   And it did it.
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.760]   Well, mine...
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.760]   It did that before too.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.560]   I mean, most of the new stuff is just like the applications.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.560]   Okay.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.080]   Anyway, I'm going to check it out.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.640]   Facebook.com.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.560]   And I'm in like with you.com.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:37.560]   And I have no life.com.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:42.000]   I'm in like with you and see if I can get the House of Prime Rib on my I'm in like with
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000]   you.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   You should.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.400]   I'll send you guys some invites.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:46.800]   Please do, would you?
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.400]   And I want to thank you, Justin, for taking time out of your busy camera head activities.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.760]   That's difficult, I know.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.000]   The site is iJustine.tv.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.280]   You can watch Justine and see what she's up to.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.880]   I think it's very cool.
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.280]   And of course, tastyblog snack.com is her blog.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.640]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   I really appreciate it.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.800]   It's great to talk to you.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.520]   Scott Borne is at applephoneshow.com.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:20.960]   And that's where you'll find out everything you'd ever want to know about the apple phone.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.600]   Or the iPhone is known.
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.400]   That's correct.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.160]   And Merlin Mann is at 43folders.com and the Merlin Show.com.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.600]   What's the newest on the Merlin Show?
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:34.560]   We're putting together our what looks like it's going to be a six episode arc with the
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:40.000]   wonderful Jesse Thorne from the sound of young America, the best podcast in America.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]   The sound of young America.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000]   Is he actually young?
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000]   Maximumfun.org.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.160]   Oh, it's disgusting.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.400]   He's like 25 and he's building this podcast empire and he's really, really neat.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.160]   What's the URL?
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.000]   Maximumfun.org.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.200]   And that's also where you get the Coyle and Sharp podcast.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.200]   Ah.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.680]   It's got another episode of Coyle and Sharp.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.000]   And yeah, I definitely would recommend checking it out.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.640]   I do love the name, the sound of young America.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.640]   That's all.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.640]   He's part of the new sincerity movement in America.
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.440]   The new sincerity movement.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.440]   It's not ironic.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.440]   It's actually sincere.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.680]   Yeah, it's like meta ironic.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:18.680]   Meta ironic.
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:19.680]   It's sincere.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.200]   These kids today with their sincerity.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:23.200]   Fat.
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:28.640]   You know, I was sincere before it was hip.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.640]   I remember.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:34.640]   I was sincere before the young people discovered sincerity.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.960]   They were all ironic, but I was sincere.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.920]   They thought I was ironic, but no, it was sincere.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:42.280]   I remember I would say to people you're not going to eat that buggy whip and they'd
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:43.280]   say, you're kidding, La Porte.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:44.520]   And I'd say, of course I'm kidding.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.520]   I'm being ironic.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:46.520]   It's ironic.
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.520]   Horses will be here forever.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:52.760]   Don't I put this device on my head that would allow me to make the garroch eggs.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.080]   All right, everybody.
