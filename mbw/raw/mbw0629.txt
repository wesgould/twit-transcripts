[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where you talk about the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.040]   And this is a very busy week. Apple with a lot of deliveries. It's a perfect time for Renee Richie
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.800]   to return to the fold. He's been on assignment meeting with folks at Apple. He probably has lots
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.000]   of great inside information from mymore.com. Hello Renee. Leo, the FedEx guy was here earlier.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960]   And he said, "What are all these boxes?" And I said, "Apple watch bands." And he said,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.760]   "I have tons of them on my truck." Oh man. I took that as a sign. Oh man. And that goes also here
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.880]   from WGBH Public Radio in Boston and in an echo.com. Great to see you, Andrew. Oh, great to see your
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.000]   shiny rested face. I am rested. Thanks for coming back. You know, from your social media feeds and
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.960]   leases, you know, you're in places that have to be a lot more attractive than the inside of a
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:32.400]   studio. So it means something that you actually chose to come back. Actually, I did not post on
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.960]   Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook because I no longer have accounts on those three sites or Tumblr.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.560]   But I did send postcards. I'm sorry that you weren't on the list, Andy. But I think after talking to
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.840]   some of my family members, you might be glad you weren't on the list. I sent a total of 17 postcards
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.120]   and three weeks. You and Kevin and Sistren left Instagram at the same time. Yes. May is right.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.520]   I am now putting the contents of the postcards up on the blog. He was using Blackens'
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.880]   photo card and has a very convenient screenshot feature. Also here from, it looks like Washington,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.200]   DC, the nation's capital. Hello. Hello. He's on his way into committee, but we've got him until
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.560]   the quorum call Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core. Yeah, it's a pretty busy week here in Washington,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.240]   DC. Do you do anything for the government?
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.880]   Yes. That's the answer. Okay. That's what I thought. Okay. That's all we're going to get, kids.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:38.080]   Confirm, no deny. You could confirm nor deny. I am looking at a lovely sand dune in the middle
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.840]   of the day, although later it will darken. And by the way, that is not on by default,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.560]   which I thought was kind of weird because at least on the all the installations, I did have
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.200]   Mojave. This is the new OS. 10, it put that in his wallpaper, but it didn't turn on
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.920]   the dynamic wallpaper feature. Is that right? Is that what your guys are experiencing as well?
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.400]   Yeah. It defaults to a familiar sort of a bright experience, and it figures you'll opt into the
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.760]   dark mode if you're feeling all. So you do get the choice straight in. You do get the choice.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.640]   My game in the dark one. You do get the choice of when you first, at least my experience was,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.960]   when you first put into, are you going to play in light mode or dark mode? You get to choose that.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:27.200]   But I just got a default wallpaper, and then I had to go in and choose dynamic in the desktop
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.360]   and screensaver system. Which there is one. There's one. Yeah. Now, is this going to just
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.000]   alternate between light and dark, or is it going to fade through like two or three or four, I think,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.440]   layers of like you get a twilight and then dark. That's pretty cool. I like that. I can't. I find
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.400]   it very oppressive during the day. Like I don't like dark mode at all during the day. It makes me
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.280]   feel somber and sad, but I do like it at night because it feels more relaxing and less bright in
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.920]   my eyes. So I like the dynamic one a lot. I'm afraid that I found that it was it. As soon as you
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.320]   have the dark mode on, everything else, anything that isn't dark mode, I just was like, Oh, bright
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:12.240]   light bright light. Like is like this at all. Yeah. Yeah. I'm very I'm very happy with the dark.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.120]   I mean, I spent a lot of time in production where you just look at dark screens all the time. And so
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.520]   it's always been kind of a pain to have it be so bright. And so it's very nice. So dark mode changes
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.160]   everything. In fact, you know, kind of a weird way in light mode, which is the mode we're all used to.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.160]   You know, the menu bars light the controls, the windows are all light. But as soon as you go to
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.440]   dark mode, everything goes dark, the menu board. And it's odd because this is San Francisco,
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.840]   right? The font here. It doesn't it doesn't look like it looks different with the dark background
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.680]   somehow. So maybe that's just my eyes, but it seems like it was designed for a light background.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.720]   As soon as you go to dark background, it seems like it's interesting. The the the the the what do
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   you call the thickness of the stroke? That seems like it's a little off. Yeah, the line weight.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.960]   This is there a lot of things just to get used to my I'm not even totally used to the time on my
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.560]   iPad no longer being in the center. So there's there's there's a lot to get used to it. I do like
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.840]   that. I do like the dark mode. I do like the auto dark mode sometimes, especially for people
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.640]   who are freelancers who are their own bosses. It's appreciated to have these little external cues
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.720]   that time is passing. And that that sounds like a joke, but it isn't.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.760]   Ours Technica, you know, no longer John Syracuse is no longer doing those big long reviews. John.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:41.120]   I'm sorry, Andrew Cunningham now does them, but they have that whatever is his 14 page review of
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.440]   10.14. It goes on and on and on. If you really want all the details, his conclusion, the best
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.680]   update in years for the Macintosh. And I have to say it does. There are many things to like about
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.480]   Mojave. I've even really delved into the deepest parts of it. He says dark mode looks rad accent
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.640]   colors injects some much needed personality. He likes quick actions and the new quick look,
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.920]   which I think that that looked very promising in the demos stacks to what they supposed to do.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.240]   They won't stack folders past. I had a weird problem with that. Like so I didn't manage 14
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.800]   pages like Andrew. I did a little shorter review, but my thing is I always dumped stuff on the
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.080]   desktop. And then I would feel bad about how cluttered it looked and I would clean it up.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.920]   And with stacks, I don't know if it looks cluttered anymore. So I'm afraid to actually count how
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.120]   many documents. Oh, interesting. Yeah. It's true. It kind of hides. It just looks neat now.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:42.960]   And I just wait like 18,000 documents. Any negatives one the one negative I might report is that
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.920]   Safari now is choose a number of extensions turns them off, including my ad blocker. You have to
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.680]   manually kind of re add, add block origin if that's what you use.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:00.800]   It's it doesn't it seems to be it seems like you can do it. But for some reason, it turned mine off.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.280]   They turned off legacy extensions because they had some security issues, but all the new type
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.200]   extensions work now and so far. What they do when you go to more extensions though,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.760]   is they send you to the Mac App Store, which also has by the way been completely redone. I keep
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:22.640]   having to end. I'm so tired of entering in my App Store password. I've entered it in. I've
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.280]   probably several dozen times between the new iPhone and the and the various versions of
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.600]   almost like you want to get a long password. I think that's the thing is like you take on,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.480]   I'm going to have a long hash so that I'm secure and then you're typing in all the time.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.080]   Oh my gosh. Horrible mistake. So these extensions that it lists in the Safari extensions are
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.960]   it's a short list, not a particularly useful list and many of them, including I think all the ad
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.520]   blockers are paid. But that but this it isn't in fact required that you get your extensions from
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:01.120]   this list despite what this looks like. What is the story? You get as long as they respect the new
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.040]   then you see the new architecture for plugins, you can get them from anywhere. I think I downloaded
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.400]   like the password one off the password website and right. I use ghost to read just so I can keep
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   track of how many trackers are popping up all the time. I think that one just came off ghost to
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.160]   recite. So I just downloaded them willy-nilly as I wanted them. Yeah. Chrome does a good job
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.360]   of that. You can actually with the latest edition you actually just the security tab or the the
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.520]   icon is now like actually a drop-down menu that will give you a full report on what's going on
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.800]   with that site. So I'm glad to see every web browser understanding that you have to understand
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.160]   these things. There's all the stuff going on behind the scenes you need to know about.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:48.000]   To get UBlock Origin I had to go to Gore Hills GitHub. Gore Hills the creator of it. Scroll down
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.080]   and find the port because there's a port of UBlock Origin for the new Safari. So it takes you
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:04.560]   oddly enough to the old extension gallery. So that's still in place even though Apple took me
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:11.120]   to the app store. So that's a growing pain. Is it? Yeah. Is it it's not negative though right?
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.320]   No again they're just there. I think the old extensions just had vulnerabilities that they
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.920]   would rather people not use anymore. So they're blocking those and they're using cleaner ones.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.600]   We're totally burying the lead here though Leo and that is icons and tabs. You can get
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.400]   fav icons and it's great. Not on by default but you can turn them on. Oh really? Yeah. You
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.480]   couldn't get that before. Oh let me let me see how to do that. Oh it's a it's a delightful story. So
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.360]   they originally did want them but then Steve Jobs saw the 16-bit icons that were passing for
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.320]   fav icons and thought they were way too ugly for Safari. So wanted Apple to redraw every icon and
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.960]   then legal told them that was not in Apple's purview to redraw every icon. So he said find no
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.600]   fav icons. Really? Well before. So where do I re-enable this? In the settings you can go to
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:00.240]   Safari settings and then just turn on. It's a sandbox somewhere. Yeah. I'm looking for it.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.680]   Search security. I think it's just a general appearance one. I think it's just a general appearance one.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:10.240]   It's probably in our web websites. No. J
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:16.480]   Favorite show. No. Is it it's an advanced feature isn't it?
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:23.200]   Mine is beach balling. Darn it. Yeah. It's in here somewhere. Okay. Good to know. I'll find it.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.840]   Good to know. This dark mode some you know I have to admit and this is Safari right which is
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:34.400]   designed. Yeah. If I Apple to work with dark mode. I've mixed feelings about this Alex you
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.280]   use it aesthetically this is appropriate. Yeah. The only concern the only thing that I don't like
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.320]   is that I feel like the text is a little too high contrast. Yeah. So the white is too white. I
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:50.640]   wish that you could you had some preferences that let me I actually want to make it darker. So I
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.480]   kind of want to push all the icons a little less contrast and a little the things that look like
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.880]   they're almost pure white. Yeah. I like to push them back just a little bit. Yeah. I feel like in
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.320]   mail is where it really shows up for me that I actually have a hard time reading it. I also don't
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.440]   like the white borders or I guess they had to do something like that but this they can but it's
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.200]   too it's too contrast. I think that it needs to be I just like for instance they cut half of that
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.840]   brightness down. Yeah. It would. Yeah. It would just look nicer. It would be easier to look at.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.560]   Yeah. It's a little too like is it you can you really use and Apple is generally very good at
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.840]   using different levels of gray to kind of guide you. Right. So this kind of stands out as as I think
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.000]   a little bit of a misstep and though some of these will probably be a little darker. Yeah.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And this is by God. This is about his nitpicky is you can. Oh, you can go to Apple's developer side
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.880]   and they have the whole. Go ahead, Ray. So I was going to say they have a whole talk. They have a
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.440]   whole design session from WWDC where they explain in painstaking detail how the glyphs work in
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.600]   dark mode and you can't just inverteg lift because it looks all wrong. Right. And how you can't just
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.920]   have cold black because people have an aversion to just pure gray. So they actually pull the color
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.800]   of the background dynamically to tint it. So it's it's never quite absolute gray. It's always a
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.120]   little warmer or cooler just you feel more comfortable with it. It's fascinating to watch.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:16.640]   Under the hood, faster, better, smarter APFS now is available on Fusion Drives. That's good news.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.320]   Yeah. Anything else out of the hood that we should be addressing talking about?
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.640]   Not like iOS 12 where Apple actually took the people responsible for the frameworks and stuck
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.320]   them in a cave for three or four months and said, you know what I'll work this stuff faster,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.360]   make it make auto layout faster, make collection views faster, make everything faster. The biggest
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.600]   change here is is really a partial change. And that's the advent of iOS apps and all the
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.480]   Marzipan frameworks. That's the biggest in inside change. Yeah. I was I was going to say, I really
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:51.200]   do hope that this is just the first swing of the bat for for this because I was I was very
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.640]   disappointed in everything that I saw in the betas. And so kind of surprise it wasn't improved
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.160]   in the release version. It's just that this is it really does look like someone just did a command
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:07.520]   C command V from iOS to Mac OS and so much of the interface just doesn't make urgent sense when you
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:13.440]   have a trackpad handy now. It looks super stripped down. You do want to tap the screen.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.120]   And that's when you remember that the man that Mac OS doesn't have a touchscreen.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:24.000]   And it's really disappointing because I felt as though if anything Apple would poor resources
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.200]   into making sure that these apps these cross platform apps that they put into Mojave are
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.920]   absolutely stellar and stunning and make the case to users and developers and see this is how good
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:43.680]   an a Mac app that shares code with an iOS app can be and but it but unfortunately just makes you
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:50.880]   want worry and wonder if Apple cares if Mac apps look exactly like iOS apps and function
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.400]   as poorly as a bad port of Windows app could be. Yeah, I think it even further and that they're
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.280]   not even this like if you go to the news app you can swipe sideways works exactly as you expected.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.600]   If you go to the home app and you try to swipe between rooms it's like a weird game of breakout
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.280]   where it bounced back. Oh, I made it through. Oh, now stuck again. Oh, and it like even the
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.920]   behavior between those two apps one works and one does and which is a. I think part of the problem
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:22.480]   is that I think Apple believes that more people use the trackpad for multi touch type things than
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.720]   actually people do. There are some shortcuts that I think that a lot of people like but they I
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.640]   don't think that most people are using the full library of multi touch taps squeezes, pinches,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.320]   and swipes like in iOS navigation style on the Mac as they as they do on the iOS. It's just
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.880]   it doesn't feel instinctive. So let's let's hope they improve things.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.320]   Yeah, I think the only thing I do is I want to go to the desktop and I want to come out of the
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.840]   desktop. You know, like that's the you know, the like three or four open and closed is the thing
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   that I think I turn all the rest of them off and yeah, well, too many things.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.960]   I'm only speaking for myself, but I had to I had to turn off a lot of those multi touch features
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.160]   because the trackpad is wonderful. It's a root, but it's really, really big. And so many times I
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.080]   didn't know that I was act that I accidentally had a third finger touching just enough to turn
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.360]   the to turn one gesture into another gesture. And so to prevent myself from accidentally triggering
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.600]   a feature I didn't want I wound up turning off the majority of all these navigations features.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:28.480]   We also will be saying goodbye to 32 bit applications on Mojave.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.360]   And I get a warning with Mojave, the next version of Mac OS will ditch them for good.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.960]   Okay, I haven't I'm actually haven't run into any at all so far.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.520]   Oh, do you run Adobe software Leo?
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.960]   Lightroom doesn't mean yeah, is Lightroom one of them?
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.640]   I get like these weird Adobe agents that I think is the one that manages the download of the other
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.000]   apps. Yeah. Yeah. Well, they can update that. Can
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.200]   can Xcode even build a three two bit app still? I was trying to figure that out today.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.160]   They call recorder. I think they put out a letter there. They're brilliant.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.760]   E cam folks are absolute geniuses and they said they hadn't been able to get
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.160]   call recorder working on Mojave yet. So they were they were putting on pause for now, which is
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.960]   that that's that's why I like I like it. I only have it on. I have two max that I use for
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.040]   day to day stuff. I have an installed on the desktop. I don't have it installed on the Mac book
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:24.080]   for that reason that there I feel as though I'm going to encounter not huge apps that don't work,
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   but a module that an app relies on that might be still stuck in 32 bit mode. And I'm
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.160]   I'm I'm hanging back on my on the on the Mac book for at least a couple of weeks.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.480]   I know that there's already an update that's in the developer chain. So we'll see what happens.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.640]   And audio and hangouts doesn't work for me on Mojave.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:47.040]   Well, audio doesn't work at all. I think I would sound like a robot.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.320]   To work sound like a robot in Ohio update has changed. There's now in the system preference
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:59.600]   pains and update preference pain, which is newly added. And it looks as if updates are going to
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.640]   go through or they're planning on having updates to go through system preference pain, right?
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.280]   Yeah, it's more like iOS now. So you just you go to your basically your settings and then it'll
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   either auto download. Auto download is a big thing in iOS 12 and Mojave now you can just set it
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.600]   and forget it, which, you know, if you're not doing system critical stuff is probably fine for you.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.120]   You are getting system critical stuff, turn that off. And then when they comes out, look at Twitter
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.360]   for a good day or two before you do any updates. You have under the advanced tabs from granularity,
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.360]   you can automatically check for updates download and available by default. I should zoom in on
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:39.440]   this a little bit by default. Installing Mac OS updates is not automatic. Yes. Installing app
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.000]   updates is and that's that's handled by the app store, not by this control panel, but the control
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.920]   panel controls it. Install system data files and security updates is by default automatic. And I
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.040]   think that's probably something you want to have automatic. Yeah, I was wishing that they would I
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.600]   haven't I haven't had an update come across since I updated to Mojave on that other machine yet.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:07.120]   But I hope that there's they handle the they handle a rejection a lot more with more dignity than
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.600]   than previous editions have. It's still it's still like a nightly routine that have to say,
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.080]   no, don't I'm not going to stop what I'm doing when I'm trying to get as much done in the next 90
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.680]   minutes as possible before I go to bed to do four to do three system up, excuse me, to do three
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.200]   updates for apps that I only occasionally use. But yes, please do annoy me about that tomorrow.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.520]   So mine is mine is like I wake up in the morning and the things that the update was not able to
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.080]   install would you like to try again now in an hour tonight and I click tonight and then tomorrow
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.880]   morning is the same time. Yeah, I kind of I kind of wish there were a third option at some point where
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.160]   like after the third or fourth time that you that you reject, it will remind you again like at
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.240]   that same time and then now there's a new option. I'll see you in hell first Mojave.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:50.640]   Thank you.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:57.920]   Somebody in his chat room is saying I don't see the purchase apps in the app store. You have to
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.920]   it's in a different spot. This is more like iTunes now. You click on your account down here and it'll
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.960]   show apps that you've been purchased by you or by other family members, which is nice.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.040]   And you can reinstall those. That's a very handy feature that I really, really like in Mac OS.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.760]   So that has disappeared. It's just it's just this is a whole different UI in the app store.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.400]   It's very different. Oh, Ken Case with his very dapper hat.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.360]   Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. The master planner.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.560]   I immediately installed Omni Focus 3. Yes. I love my devices. Of course.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.800]   Anything from Omni is going to be good. Yeah.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.520]   What else anything else to say before we move on? Because there are a lot of new things from Apple.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.840]   I mean, the security and privacy stuff is nice. There were initially a few people who complained
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.960]   that it was too much like Windows, Vista's universal access controls where they were afraid that
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.360]   they would get hampered by dialogues all the time. But after running it for a few months,
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.800]   like they were very and I'm not a developer. I don't use Xcode and I don't use a bunch of
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.960]   other things. And I know there were some annoyances with Xcode that Dave Nanyan did a really good blog
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.280]   post on. But in general, it's been kind of use your camera. Can I use your microphone once?
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.720]   The finder one is confusing. I wish they would, you know, because I don't think anybody knows
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.040]   why an app would want permission to use the finder. So I'm hoping they can reword that.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.080]   But you know what I'm seeing a lot is accessibility preferences. Oh,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.800]   yes. Everything Chrome. Everything needs accessibility preferences. Why is that?
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.680]   Dropbox. Yeah. Should I worry? Should I give this? Should I just say, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.080]   They want deep file access and the easiest way for them to get it is to ask for accessibility
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.840]   access because then they can basically the same thing as text, expander, and a lot of other things.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   It gives them a lot more control over your computer. And there was some controversy over it because
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.000]   people thought it was a bit of an overreach. But I've been using it and I haven't noticed any
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.400]   weird behavior from it. Yeah. Okay. So that's good. Yeah. I mean, I'm basically giving everybody
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.640]   permission when they ask, but it is confusing. And when there's so many of them, people do get
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.840]   dialogue fatigue. So I hope they can tune the balance. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.760]   I got to say, I really want as a small feature, but it's one of those magical ones that I like to
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:10.480]   see from Apple. I really like continuity camera. Just this idea of cool that. Yeah. That if you
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.960]   tell us what that picture is, if you want it, like if you need to insert, if you need a picture to
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.240]   be inserted someplace you're used to, well, I'll just I'll get it from my photos library or I'll
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:25.760]   get it from this folder. But you can also say, because it knows that your iPhone or iPad is nearby
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.480]   and it does have a camera, you can't let you just simply pick up your iPhone, take the picture,
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:36.960]   and there is no like airdrop or anything to simply magically is magically is saved into that document
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:43.840]   or wherever you want it to go. And for things like when you when you match it with things like OCR
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.200]   and the ability to say, well, here is a page here's a page from a book that I want to quote in its
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.320]   entirety, the ability to simply hold up that camera and have that OCR and the text flows into
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:00.240]   the document at the insertion point. It's just it's again, it's not the sort of thing that is that
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.520]   is a paradigm shifting, but this is exactly the sort of stuff I was in. I was hoping that I'd be
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.840]   able to do in 2018 with a computer is just, Oh, I see you have a phone nearby. I see it's one of
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.640]   those new fangled ones with a camera. By all means, don't don't don't save it to your Dropbox that
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.720]   imported just I don't want to do that. I'm smart. I'm a computer. You spent thousands of dollars
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.440]   for me. Let me start to pay you back for letting me into your home. By the way, here's what you'll see.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.400]   I just opened Chrome for the first time since the upgrade Google Chrome and a lot of apps at least
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.000]   four or five apps have asked this so far of me would like to control this computer using
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.760]   accessibility features. By the way, that's not in the accessibility control system preference
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.800]   payments in the security and privacy preferences. So you open that up and you'll see a number of
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.880]   applications that want this permission. You mentioned Dropbox. There's Google Chrome. You'll have to
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:58.160]   unlock this to get into it, which is kind of a pain. And then you can check the box in Google
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   Chrome. So you're saying Renee that that's normal, that's okay. Allow it. Yeah, it's just it's again
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.000]   an easy way for them to get the file system level access. Apple's protecting a ton of different
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.960]   things. I think this is good. I mean, it's not on course. If it's Chrome or Dropbox and you know the
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.680]   name, you're going to say, okay. And if it's, you know, hacker tools nine nine six seven,
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.560]   you're going to say, whoa, hold on there. So I don't mind that at all. But at the same time,
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.320]   I've been reading on I've been reading in message boards, a lot of developers who are having problems
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.120]   with very basic things like I need to be able to locate where this folder exists.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.440]   And with old sandboxing was very, very easy for me to just take that away from the
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:43.200]   user because I know it has to be in one of three places without having them search for it.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.560]   And now there are new APIs that say, we don't like your app being able to see that far into the
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:54.000]   across the landscape. Just have the user select, find it for you. And the developer saying, yeah,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.480]   but that's another step that I can take care of because it's, it's not going to be in the system
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.160]   library folder is not going to be the music folder. I know it's going to be in three places. Let me
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.240]   just check these three different places to see if the folder exists. So there's going to be some
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.080]   more growing pains, I think. Certainly, from the point of view of developers, it's a pain in the
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.000]   butt, but for the point of view of users, if you go to security privacy and you look at the privacy
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.040]   tab there, you can really, this is much more like iOS where you really could see who's got access
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.240]   to context calendars, photo, just the convenience versus security conundrum.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:33.040]   Yeah, I think this is this is very much inspired by mobile. And I think that that's a good,
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.600]   good thing to take from mobile. I don't mind that at all.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.760]   I like, I especially like the idea of the user being informed and being able to look like
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.560]   months later, they might have clicked through a dialogue box because again, you've got 90 minutes
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.280]   before you have to leave the office to get something done and then something that's
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.200]   interrupting you. If you just simply say, okay, you get to get on with the next thing you want to do.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.680]   It's good to be able to see, oh, I'm just curious, what does this, what does, what does Microsoft
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.800]   Office get to do? And you're kind of, or you're surprised that a solitary game wants to know your
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.200]   location and wants to be able to see your pictures folder saying, whoa, why is it doing that? And I
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.320]   haven't played that in three months. So I'm just going to delete it. That's sort of stuff. I think
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.560]   is a really, really solid thing. There's there are a lot of ideas from mobile that really enhance
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:20.240]   Mac OS and I'm glad when Apple makes these good choices show, walk me through continuity camera.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:25.600]   So I have my iPhone. I'm going to take a picture of a document. What do I do to get this to go?
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.600]   You need to initiate it from your Mac. So you need to do it like from pages or some other
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.240]   and I'm just in trouble with keynote. I got trouble with keynote where it just times out.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:40.080]   You haven't had that? I can see the warning for me. So if I'm in keynote and I
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:48.720]   I'm trying to. I've got a blank pages document. What would I do to say I want to embed a picture
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.800]   in there? I don't know if you need a photo holder. It's on your media. So if you click on media
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.680]   and you'll see your phone or you should.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.880]   Leo's excess. Take photo. Okay. And then I'm going to take a picture.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:10.640]   Let's see. I'll take an ice picture myself. And okay, I did use photo. And now. Oh, wow. Look at that.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.240]   That is pretty sweet. But you're saying keynote, you've had some issues with it.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.600]   Yeah, I just tried it again. And it's still it's still not working.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.400]   Is it using the same stuff as airdrop or is it something different?
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.520]   Yeah, no, it's very similar. Some people are wondering like why you would do that because if you have a
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.520]   laptop or an iMac, you have a camera on it. But those are horrible. Oh, no, no, no.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.280]   Oh, I know. This is awesome to be able to use this is to scan stuff or.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.040]   You're not going to pick up your MacBook off of your desk and.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:43.920]   So I'm going to take a let's see. Let's scan a document here. So I don't know. Why is that
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   different? Use your phone's camera to scan a document. Okay, let's do that.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:54.000]   Be multi page. Oh, well, it can be it can be multi page drag corners to adjust. I see.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.840]   Keep scan. I get it. So it gives you some more controls over what's going on.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.880]   And then that goes good. That's going to end up safe. Oh, I have to say safe or I get it. It's
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.160]   multi as you said. And there it is. Look at that. That's sweet. That's a keynote. So I don't know
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.240]   what I don't know what your problem is. It's almost enough to make me forget that it's like four
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.320]   years later. And we still don't have hand off from media. Not quite enough to make me forget that.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:22.400]   Yeah, I'll tell you, I was trying to use airdrop between Max and iOS on the cruise ship and.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.840]   And partly that's because you're on the cruise ship Wi-Fi or you're on. No, this should be
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.520]   I should be in because it should happen. Point Wi-Fi. I should do with the crew.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.400]   And it didn't work very well very often, but that's okay. That's okay. I live on airdrop now.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:42.720]   It's like a. Do you? It's cross. It's cross. It's iOS. It's iOS. Yeah. To Mac OS. Okay, good.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.400]   All right. That's as long as you have a recent Mac, the old Mac used a different kind of airdrop.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.240]   But then you you can't get the Bluetooth. No, totally. As long as you have Bluetooth 4.0 or later,
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.360]   you're fine. I just want to point out anybody watching video that I am using the external GPU.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.200]   I haven't used it in months, but I am using it for no reason. And he is also stroving it thoughtfully.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.920]   I have to say I decided in a paternal way. Yes. Well, I spent some money on this like a like a
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:15.600]   favorite child. It's pretty like a favorite child, but useless. I did take the i9 MacBook Pro
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.880]   on the trip. And I have to say, having all of that performance under Lightroom, which is normally
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.680]   really painful to use, I didn't have to use any fancy workflow. I went right into Lightroom.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:31.600]   Everything was fast and just felt great. And that's without I did not bring the GPU in my luggage.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.280]   That's without the EGPU. All right, good. I mean, I think in general, have there been any
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:43.200]   cries of pain on Mojave came out on Monday or Tuesday, maybe? Yeah.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.080]   No, there are a couple of really odd ones. Like Apple put up an article saying if you had a
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.920]   very specific iMac, a late 2012 iMac with three terabyte drive and 27 inch screen,
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.200]   you had to stop using, you had to stop using bootcamp if you wanted to update them.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:01.680]   I'm not like a two terabyte drive, not like a 2014 iMac, but just that one model.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.640]   And I haven't been able to figure out why yet. But there's a couple weird things like that.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.440]   That sounds like there's an engineer who just had like a bad divorce or breakup.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.400]   And she just wants to make sure that Kevin's MacBook specifically
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:20.800]   not going to work. Yeah, those are the kinds of things that are harder to detect in massive
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:26.000]   public beta test, which Apple has done and are going to crop up. But the advantage of having
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.040]   all these public beta test users is this has been tried on a lot of Mac and Tasha's and has been.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.800]   And I realized yesterday I haven't seen a Facebook button on a website in so long,
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.680]   I barely remember the existence. You know, it's interesting when you get rid of Facebook.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:48.080]   Yeah. How much the world expects you to have a Facebook account? Yeah. It's kind of depressing,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:56.320]   really. All right. Somebody's asking about LastPass. I actually, I've been using LastPass
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.120]   without issue, but I use I haven't downloaded and I should try downloading the standalone app,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   but I haven't had any problem with that. There are sponsor bars. So I have some interest. I have
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.680]   to say LastPass on iOS 12 or any password manager, I presume, is a real revelation with the auto
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.040]   fill now on iOS 12. It's a fan. And you barely noticed that it just looks at your face and
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:23.040]   fills your passwords. It's a lot. I love that. Let's talk about iOS 12 because we also got that.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:29.120]   We got all the all the OS is got updated. Anything to say about iOS 12, except that, you know,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.840]   those of us who've been using it for some time are happy. The rest of you have it shortcuts is now
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   shortcuts. Yeah, not workflow. And it's I love seeing some of the stuff. I mean, some of
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.680]   there is super sad, but some of them are super impressive. Like there's one where you just tell
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.160]   Siri you're being pulled over and it turns off everything turns on the camera alerts your emergency
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.800]   contacts, starts recording. And as soon as you say you're safe, it sends a video to your contact.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   That's built in the shortcuts. No, that's like, no, that's sad, but it's brilliant. The D
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:06.560]   WB shortcut. Yeah. It's it's all about having control over this device that you own. And that's
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:12.800]   why shortcuts is just in and of itself is the reason to upgrade to iOS 12. Just this morning,
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:18.240]   I was I was doing the same thing that I do, like almost every Wednesday morning, when I have a
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.680]   breakfast with friends, and it's like, Oh, if I had if I hadn't switched to Android a few years ago,
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.920]   my phone would right now be sending that text message saying I am actually leaving the house
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:34.400]   right now. I am 15 minutes away on my bike, but please order me my usual breakfast. But no, like,
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.560]   like a like a dope, I had to actually do that manually on my I could have I could have done that.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:44.400]   I could have used a couple of different macro tools on Android, but nothing that this this is like
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.920]   that was like 2001 type technology. This is again, the sort of feature that you hope that you could
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:56.560]   be able to use in 2018 on a phone. I was so inspired by shortcuts that downloaded launch
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:04.160]   launch control pro launch center pro. Yeah. And then I saw this post on a microblog by Vasta.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:09.200]   He says inspired by at Eli quick look at my current home screen. It's a minimalist home screen.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.480]   There's just four icons in the dog between automation offered in shortcuts, drafts, things,
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:21.440]   and launch center pro. I live living the mostly empty home screen life. That is inspiring.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.200]   For you who wrote it, but someone's like, Apple is actually documenting ex Carl,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.680]   ex call back URL. I'm living in a different time and space. Yeah. That's what launch center pro
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.840]   uses is the URL scheme. The fact that Apple is now embracing it, supporting it and shortcuts
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:45.440]   is here. And you can see how automation is really, you know, I know that Sal is spinning in his grave,
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.640]   but no, I'm sorry. Sal was just here. Sal's a boy and who created, you know, really was the
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:57.440]   champion for this at Apple for years and left Apple. I think someone involuntarily a couple of
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:04.560]   years ago, I asked him. He's very gratified. He said, you know, it would be nice to have, you know,
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.760]   that kind of support on Mac again, but it's still automation is so important. I think to people who
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:16.400]   use computing, not not average, everyday users, but to people who want to use it in a more sophisticated
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   way. And there's things that you just can't do. I this was a long time ago, another lifetime ago,
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:29.440]   and I probably 1990 for five. And I was, I was actually running the production for a magazine.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.080]   And one of the things that we used automation for, and it was a mixture of Apple scripts and
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.480]   file maker, we had, you know, all of these ads that had to go into classified in the back of
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.040]   a into the back of the magazine. And so that was all being managed in file maker. And then we had
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.640]   to take all that data, and we had to get it all into Quark Express and format it all correctly and
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.960]   make sure that it didn't have any weird things at the end of the page and all those things. And that's
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.880]   and that was like, you didn't, you didn't try to figure out how to hand craft that, you just
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.800]   kept on working the script. You know, you just kept on working like, okay, well, didn't do that. Let's
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.120]   let's add a little bit more to it. And it could get very complicated with display ads and all
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.680]   kinds of other bits and pieces. So it's why one of the one of the heavy users of Apple script has
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.560]   been the print industry, because you just do a lot of formatting and a lot of process with it. And
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:20.400]   it's really you just couldn't do it. I don't even know how they did it before that. Like,
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.160]   like when I think about people who had to like do it on paper and then put it in, I was like,
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.680]   Oh, my hand. That was just it just hurts my head, you know, so it but but that automation of how to
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.640]   insert all of those things into into bits and pieces is is just such a key to the operation.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:41.840]   By the way, I thanks to the chat room. I am now getting the police shortcut on. Yeah. So that
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:49.280]   I can get I can configure the shortcut. Who would you like to be messaged in event of being pulled over?
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:57.200]   Okay, good. Good. I can add I can add my wife. Or Andy, I mean, either Randy or Renee. Yeah.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.320]   One of you should know this for sure. You should you should have someone in every time zone or
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.720]   every three time zones. So the makes of the someone will be awake. Who would you like to be sent a
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.400]   copy of the recorded video? I'll send that to Andy. I mean, again,
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.240]   I'm going to get a status. Yeah, actually, you don't want to go send it to my WordPress blog.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:22.640]   That's where I should send it. Yeah, blog it. I have a special WordPress email address. That's what
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:28.160]   I'll do. So blog that video of being. Oh, I should mention that we have Matthew Castellini,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.040]   who was one of the work the workflow team members writing all the guides for us on I'm more. Oh,
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.960]   nice. You want to get started. Awesome. He goes there and he does everything from getting started
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.840]   to using it on all the different devices. I was so excited. I got woke up at four in the morning
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:48.000]   and started playing with shortcuts and trying to figure out how I could like post an animated
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.320]   selfie to my blog automatically and with a pushable button and stuff like that. I just said I wanted
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.920]   my fellas coffee and it said it would take me at day and 15 a day and a half to drive there.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:02.800]   So police pauses the music sets do not disturb on sets the brightness all the way down,
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.440]   gets the current location, sends a message to my wife saying, I'm getting pulled over. My current
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.680]   location is here, takes a video from the front camera, saves it to the photo album,
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:18.640]   sets the brightness back to normal, sends a message. Here's a video of the police interaction
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:27.040]   to my blog. Thank you, Robert A. Peterson, unread it for creating one of the most of it.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.920]   It goes on. There's more one of the most amazing shortcuts ever. Holy cow.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:39.360]   Well, that shows you a feature in 2018 that we all wish we had.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:52.160]   It's amazing. What else? Okay. There is a reference in the iOS 12.1 beta to a iPad 2018 fall.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:38:00.720]   How is that possible? How could that be? So when is this event going to be? I'm hoping I'm holding
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:08.320]   out hope that I might get invited. Will it be an event you think? I think, I mean, they have
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.760]   iPads and they have Macs and that's usually enough for a very small October event.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:18.480]   Yeah, I would do it. And the iPad sounds like it's a big, like usually when there's a redesign,
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.680]   they like to get it shown off on stage. Yeah. Yeah. Also given the people they're trying to
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.920]   sell these to, they've already they already had the event for people who don't have a whole lot of
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.200]   money for an iPad. This is for people who are who they're trying to woo away from things, things
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   like the new Surface Pad and the new and really cool five, six, seven hundred dollar Chromebooks
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:44.800]   and other stuff. Google's probably going to have something interesting to show off as a new Chromebook
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.760]   in October 9th with a lot of new features. So I wouldn't be surprised if they have an actual
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.600]   event plans. They can say, we know that there's a reason why this costs a thousand dollars.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:57.760]   That's because it is the best damn tablet you can possibly buy. But don't call it a tablet.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.160]   Yeah, it's an iPad. It's a computer. It's better than a tablet. It's better than a laptop.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.480]   It's an iPad. Of course, it'll be interesting to see what they do with the connector.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.120]   You know, that the, you know, there were those rumors. Yeah, that it would go with Type C, right?
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:18.400]   It would allow you to charge it a lot faster, theoretically. And possibly it could open up a
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:25.040]   USB-C connection would open, I think, open up the iPad to a lot more inputs. And if someone like me,
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:31.280]   you know, more direct inputs did for video, all kinds of other bits and pieces. It could be a truly
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:37.840]   completely low latency monitor for a computer. You could be digitizing stuff. It could open up a
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.440]   whole new industry. Yeah, that's what I was thinking, particularly given that these are the
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:50.640]   iPad Pro models as an accessory to a MacBook Pro, being able to be a slave second display
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:58.960]   with an iPad Pro quality to a MacBook Pro, and also having the access to Apple, the Apple pencil,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:04.560]   we just saw how cool it is to be able to have continuity camera. Imagine having like continuity
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:10.320]   tablet where this is, it will say, oh, I see you have an iPad and it's docked by a USB-C.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.560]   Would you like to use this as a second screen with a touchscreen input device
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.760]   layered on top of it? There are a lot of really cool things I could do with USB-C. Maybe we wouldn't
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:25.200]   even see them in the first year, but there are a lot of super cool things about an iPad with USB-C
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:31.360]   connector. Well, and also if you released a Mac Mini with USB-C and you had an iPad with a USB-C,
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:37.440]   you have a touchscreen with your Mac Mini. Also, that huge humongous battery inside my iPad Pro
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:43.600]   just as a thing to charge my phone with. That also would be if that was a day one feature.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.880]   That would I'd be thinking about how much money I could lay my hands on on the ship date and
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:55.280]   maybe making some rash decisions. We should mention that Patrick Wardle, who is a long time
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:03.600]   security expert on the Macintosh, tweeted that there is a zero-day bypass of the new Mojave
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:11.440]   privacy controls permitting a user, a bad guy to access a user's address book.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:18.480]   He posted a 60-second video on Vimeo to demonstrate it, but I imagine this will get fixed pretty
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.320]   darn quick, right? Yeah, it doesn't look like a huge threat and it's probably going to get fixed
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.240]   in a pretty quick test. Do you need local access to do it? It looks like you do. I believe so,
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.560]   yeah, it only gives you it doesn't work with all of the privacy pains, just I think the contacts one.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.160]   There was also a lot, well while you were away, Leo, there was an Apple Change, their privacy policy
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.760]   to include some language about how they're creating a unique identifier based on the usage metrics of
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.400]   your machine. So basically what happens is they take a bunch of metadata, things like how many
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:51.280]   messages, how many emails you have, and they calculate a token number. And they use that token
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.800]   number whenever you make a purchase on iTunes to try to make sure it's actually you making that
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.440]   purchase because theoretically there was a problem with a bunch of hacked iTunes accounts in China
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.080]   and Singapore. And this is just one more layer of defense in depth that they can use to try to
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.560]   verify that it's actually you making the purchase. And yeah, nothing is perfect. So it might, you
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.800]   know, let some bad transactions through it might flag some good ones, but it was one more number
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.480]   and there were a bunch of articles freaking out about Apple, you know, spying on all your data,
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:20.320]   but they do the calculation locally, they come up with a unique number locally, they encrypt that
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   number, they send it to iTunes, they don't persist it for very long, they just match it when you make
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:30.000]   transactions. And it's like one of many metrics they use to try to detect fraud on the iTunes
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.920]   store, and they purge it and they'll do it again if they need to. Fair enough. But that does always
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.200]   make people a little nervous when they hear stuff like that, because of course that's the trick used
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   by. I mean, at the very end, it was very specific in what it was for and how they were doing it,
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.160]   but that part was ignored by a lot of the reporting. Hey, here's another nice feature, by the way,
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:53.040]   I've accidentally discovered in Safari, you can have, you can set reader, the reader mode to go on
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:59.200]   any particular website. So if you really don't like the advertising or the layout of a particular
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:04.320]   website, in this case, I'm doing it on ZDNet, anytime I go to a ZDNet website, it will automatically pop
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:11.280]   up in reader mode, which is nice. Yeah, but I mean, you could turn it on and off, obviously,
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.440]   and you may not want to do that. Yeah. But what do you think I'm going to like it?
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:24.160]   Well, it's always a little bit difficult when you have the manufacture of the operating system.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:30.400]   And they're basically allowing you to read ad supported content without seeing the ads and
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:36.160]   without the machine or read that that paid for it being able to justify being paid for this.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:43.120]   I don't think it's necessarily something they should be ashamed of, but I would not, I bet there
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.560]   are people who are trying to figure out a way to script around that and say, "Okay, we're not going
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:53.760]   to pay." It looks like you're reading reader mode. Although I do think, like, unless I asked
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.680]   to double check this, but I think initially it loads the page and it just doesn't really fast,
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.840]   it replaces it with the reader modes. So you're not seeing the ads, it probably kills click-through
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.920]   rate, but it probably doesn't hurt display rate, because it's still pulling the code in the initial
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:11.520]   web get. Let me just see what happens when I go to i- If you like the dark mode is kind of like dark,
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.600]   kind of a dark background now with the reader mode is also taken on the dark look.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:21.040]   This is reader mode on i-more. You must already do it. You have to go to an article.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:29.360]   Okay, okay, let's see what happens now. So I don't know if it loaded the page,
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.920]   didn't do it visibly, but do you have full control over that? And if you say, "No, no, I'm
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.400]   more to monetize," you can just turn that off. See, what I'd pay good money for, though,
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:43.520]   is a default setting to pull the desktop version of a website to iPad because in 2018,
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.400]   I go to Reddit on my iPad and I get the stupid iPhone version.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.560]   I agree with you 100% on that one.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:54.320]   You're right, there are a lot of things I like to override. The one thing for me is when,
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:01.200]   for some stupid reason, they've decided to disable pinch and zoom and just not even double tapping
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.000]   on the text will expand the page so that it fills the margins of the screen. It's like,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.960]   "Wow, what did I do to you or your ancestors to cause you to not want me to be able to read
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.400]   this wonderful content in a way that is readable on my device?" You actually had a work to do that.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.640]   You could have just done nothing and it would have been wonderful.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:24.240]   I'm still trying to figure out how to just give it a list of pages.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:28.880]   And I knew that Sow had kind of an automated way of doing this and I've just never gotten
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:33.280]   into quite work where I just want to take all the pages and just turn them all to audio and then
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.760]   just pass them all on to them. That's my podcast.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.240]   That's my point.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:36.800]   That'd be nice.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.760]   Yeah, I remember the whole bunch of...
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.560]   I was like, "I want to show us that."
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.440]   But it's never really... I've always kind of... You get it into reader mode, you get the text,
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.560]   then... And trying to get it all working, I've never been able to... I can do it on one page,
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.000]   but then I might as well read the page at that point. I just wanted to just publish it.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.560]   And the problem is I've gotten used to the economist. The economist has... The entire
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.040]   magazine is in audio and you get used to it and now I can't read the economist.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.080]   I'm just like... If I sit down and start reading it, I'm just like,
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.480]   "I could be listening to this while I'm doing something else."
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:06.960]   So...
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.840]   Your jumbo read the economist to me. The short cutler stuff.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:15.360]   They actually have nice folks with English accents reading it to you.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.320]   Yeah, I don't like it.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.280]   Let me do this.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:17.760]   I'm just wondering...
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.840]   I wish to do this in English accent.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.920]   So you won't mind it. How about that?
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   It's the new reader mode. We still have ads, but they're all done in an accent.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.480]   Our show today brought to you by the last pass. We were talking about last pass.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.960]   And if you haven't tried LastPass on iOS 12 or Android Oreo yet, you're just going to love
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.080]   the new autofill, which makes it completely transparent. It uses Face ID.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:48.400]   It's so great. And when I... I had unfortunately been using iOS beta 12
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:53.520]   on my old iPhone and so I couldn't just copy the old iPhone onto the new one.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:58.480]   I had to reset it up, but it wasn't a pain because I had LastPass on here and I could quickly access
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.840]   all of my passwords and accounts and set up all those apps instantly.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:09.680]   I love LastPass. Secure every password-protected entry point to your business with LastPass.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:15.760]   LastPass, of course, we've talked about it for years for individual use and I know you use it,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.160]   but your business should use it as well. 33,000 businesses use LastPass.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.480]   And if you think about it, it's even more critical in the enterprise because after all,
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:30.400]   you're giving your employees access to some of your most vital resources, like your bank accounts
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:36.000]   and your QuickBooks and your servers and your data. And when they have that password,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.520]   they can do all sorts of silly things, like put it on a Post-it note on the screen or give it to
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:48.080]   a friend. You know that password sharing is a massive problem in businesses now. A huge number
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:53.120]   of employees. What was the number? 81% of employees admit to sharing passwords with other employees
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:59.760]   and sometimes even non-employees. LastPass Enterprise makes it easy to share passwords without giving
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:05.120]   up the keys to the kingdom. You keep access to your data secure. You get full customization of
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:10.480]   access. Over 100 policies, you could set master password requirements, enable password resets,
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.920]   restrict access if you have to. You get security reports, shared folders. I love the shared
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.800]   folders. We use that all the time. We have folders for ops and business and producers.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:26.160]   And that way, people who need password access can get it quickly and easily.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:31.600]   Which is not just passwords. We put database logins in there. I keep my SSH keys, my PGP key,
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:38.480]   my software licenses, even my passports, social security numbers, and driver's license because
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:44.640]   LastPass is absolutely secure. Fully encrypted, LastPass itself doesn't have access to your data.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:51.440]   No one does accept you. And with the LastPass Authenticator app, you get multi-factor authentication.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.600]   I love the way they do this. It's not a six-digit code with the app. You could have a verification
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:01.280]   button on pop-up on an employee's phone to say, "Okay, that's you right logging into the QuickBooks
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:07.120]   account. If credentials are compromised, the app ensures outsiders still won't have access."
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:13.440]   The LastPass Password Generator makes it easy to create great passwords. And if you use active
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.480]   directory, Microsoft's Active Directory, you'll love this. You can log on to your LastPass account
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.520]   with Microsoft Active Directory. Data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:30.240]   The vault is completely secret even from LastPass. LastPass also offers, of course,
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.640]   premium for personal use families for the entire family. LastPass teams for small groups.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.800]   And the one we use LastPass Enterprise. We've been using it for years. I've been using LastPass
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:45.920]   for almost 10 years since they started. Find out more. LastPass.com/twit. 13 million people use LastPass.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:51.520]   It's the first thing I install on my brand new iPhone. It should be the first thing you install
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.160]   on your brand new computer, your phone. LastPass.com/twit.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:01.920]   The new iPhone is here. The new iPhone is here. By the way, I did a product red case,
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.840]   but I did get that folio again because I really came to like that on the old iPhone X.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.720]   This is the 10S Max. And you've got little and big, don't you?
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:16.880]   One is bigger than my head, Leo. I like the 10S Max. And you know, I even turned on Zoom
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.960]   because I realized even without Zoom, you're not getting so much more screen, you get about
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:27.360]   13% more screen real estate. So it's not like, you know, all of a sudden, you got a tablet in your
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.400]   hand, but it is easier for older eyes to read. And actually, there's some of us like, that's the
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.000]   real story behind the XS Max. I'm sorry, the 10S Max. Is it's...
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Excess is fair. I mean, it's Apple's fault now. They went through OS X. They just learn.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.040]   Tiredly their fault. I know. I like calling it the XS. It's excessive.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.880]   No, one is a numeral and one is a letter. You must pronounce the first as a number and the second.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:54.400]   I actually am very happy with this. Although, I'm really interested. I think the... And by
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.160]   the way, I haven't had a chance to talk about this. I was on vacation when they announced all this.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.440]   I think the X or the 10R is going to be very interesting.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.960]   Yeah. That may be the sweet spot phone for a lot of people, right?
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.680]   There's a bunch of people complaining that it's not 1080p. And I think they just don't understand
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.840]   how video works because you look at it side by side with the iPhone 10. Basically, the iPhone
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:22.240]   10R is at 2X. The iPhone 10S is at 3X. And you could scale, like the previous iPhone plus was
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:27.360]   scaled down 1080p, but then people complained about Flickr. This screen is a miracle of LCD
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:32.400]   design. It looks fantastic. And you can scale whatever 1080p source you want, and it looks great on it.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.080]   So I think it's a lot of internet. And if you're upgrading from anything with the iPhone 10,
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.520]   you're used to an LCD screen. This is going to be the best LCD screen you've used.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:44.400]   I think this is going to be... And it's less expensive, right? 750.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:48.480]   Same processor, which is... Exactly the same. Especially with that screen.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.280]   You aren't getting the camera. I don't know how big a deal that's used.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.640]   Well, you're getting half the camera. You're getting the same wide-angle camera,
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.920]   the same wide-angle camera sensor. You're just not getting the telephoto.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:03.120]   But on the front of the device, you're getting the same face ID. You're getting the same front camera.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:11.520]   I really think that you really have to have a great reason to buy an... I'm sick, my guns.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:18.960]   An excess. The character Patrick Stewart plays is Professor X, not Professor X. That's how that's
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.600]   going to be my defense. Although Grant Morris has screwed us over with Wolverine.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.640]   I'm going to get into that. That's true. But that will save that for our three of the show.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:34.720]   I think you have to have a really good reason to buy an excess before the XR comes out. So,
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:39.360]   you can hold both them in your hand and decide if you'd much rather have... And I'm not even saying
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.760]   necessarily that you shouldn't spend a thousand dollars on a phone. I'm saying that if you had
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:48.560]   a thousand dollars to spend, maybe you'd much rather get an excess and get as much memory.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.960]   Get so much, so much, so much more memory on it, more storage on it,
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.160]   then get just the base model excess. So...
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.000]   And essentially the camera is doing the same thing that the pixel does,
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.080]   where they don't have the two cameras to pull depth data from. So they use the
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:10.720]   the focus pixels to sort of get a bit of parallax and then they apply a segmentation mask to it.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:15.440]   It's only been machine learned for people. So like silhouettes and faces, you might be able to
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.520]   extend that to pets, but it's not going to do arbitrary objects the way a 10S will. But if
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.200]   you mostly want to use portrait mode for portraits, then it still does a really good job.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:28.400]   Interesting. That's basically what Google's doing with their single lens.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.760]   Same system, different algorithms.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:35.200]   I got the gold. I think the gold is very pretty. Again, this is the size and the color
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:39.920]   are really aimed at the Chinese market. Also, the dual sim capability aimed at China.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.520]   And the Pittsburgh Stealer fans.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:46.640]   And Stealer fans. Let's not forget. I've been having a hard time. I haven't bought it yet.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.760]   Because I had to go look at it at a store. I wanted to...
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.520]   I was like, "Ah, this is a Stealer fan. I'm kind of like black and gold.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:59.040]   The problem is you don't really see it because, of course, if you're saying human, you keep it in
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.400]   the case. So you'll never risk it. The Bruins fans know it in their heart, the Leo.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.640]   I like it. Did it...
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:12.000]   Renee, did anybody talk to you about that particular formulation of color?
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.320]   It's a very buttery sort of color. I don't think it's bad at all.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:22.000]   I think it seems like a signature version of gold that's different from other golds I've seen in the
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.880]   Apple line. Yeah. So mostly they spoke about in terms of watch because watch is the same gold
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.960]   color as iPhone, but people seem to care about it a lot more on the watch than they do on the phone.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.760]   And Apple got rid of the addition. There's no more ceramics. So gold is what they thought was the
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:42.160]   hottest thing in material science right now. And it's a PVD coating. It's a vapor deposition coating,
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.680]   which is similar to DLC. DLC is a PVD, but not all PVDs is DLC and it's horribly confusing.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:52.480]   It's a very specific, like, yeah, it's a little bit pink. It's a little bit brown.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:58.800]   And they went from yellow gold and rose gold and champagne gold and rose gold to blush gold with
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:04.320]   the iPhone 8. And now this is a deeper version of it. And the band is supposed to be, I don't know if
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:09.120]   it's DLC quality hard, but it's supposed to be as, you know, a very durable the way a lot of PVD
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.160]   coatings are. And they used it on the inside too. Like the inside is a multi layer, like,
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.760]   they've been doing this for years, but it's a multi layer, multi depth coating that really does
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:23.520]   look very different under very different kinds of lighting. Cameras quite good. Although as a
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:28.160]   number of people, particularly the Verge pointed out, it's not still not better than the Pixel 2
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:33.600]   and the Pixel 3 will be out in a couple of weeks. Who cares? Does anybody? Does that really,
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:42.720]   it's a lot of personal preference. Yeah. And I do think that there's, you can make it a decision,
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:47.120]   you can make a determination by doing all this testing of I took the same eight photos and eight
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.000]   different lighting situations side by side. And also we did, we look, we gave you all these
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.760]   histograms, all these graphs we did. But and you can actually, you can numerically prove, I think
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:03.280]   that one camera is better than the other according to numbers. But I don't, I've not seen a flagship
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:09.440]   phone this year or probably even last year, where the difference between the quote best one and
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:15.520]   the next three was so great that it would be any reason for anybody who engineered it to be
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:21.040]   embarrassed. It's still a fantastic phone. It will take great pictures. And you will, if you, if the
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:26.080]   skin tones are a little bit, quote, too warm, you would probably only notice it if you took up
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:32.000]   the same picture next to a Galaxy Note or Pixel at the same time. Otherwise, you are not going
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.360]   to notice it. And if you do notice it, you spend all of 0.8 seconds in the photos app to, to,
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.320]   to cool down the image. And it's fine. What are they like? I know some people really loves like
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.920]   Samsung questions the blacks and boosted sat and some people love that. I find it a little too warm.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:51.760]   Google is very almost scientific about it. And I find that a little cool Apple somewhere in the
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.680]   middle. And sometimes I like that. Sometimes I want it cooler. But like Annie said, they're shooting
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:59.840]   really great photos. The only thing I don't like is that they seem to be smoothing out my selfies.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:05.840]   And that was the question I was going to ask. Yeah, they're using the beauty filter and a considerable
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:10.160]   amount of smoothing on the front facing camera for selfies. Yeah, some of what I like about that
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:15.040]   forward. You can't really turn that off. Right? No. Yeah. So I think we'd have to keep complaining
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:20.640]   until a software update changes that. Okay. Yeah. I did. But the other thing that makes it stand
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:26.160]   out are the software features they put in. I really like being able to, there are a lot, most phones
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:32.880]   these days have the ability to simulate Boca, like the blurred out background. I love the fact that
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:39.600]   it's just a setting in photos now kind of that you're not limited by whatever decision you made
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:45.040]   when you when you click the shutter. If you decided that, Oh gosh, the background, there's a there's a
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.800]   guy eating ice cream and he's got ice cream all over the front of his shirt. I'm sorry people
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:54.400]   were in the public garden last week. I was really hungry. I missed breakfast. But and after the fact
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.880]   you can decide you want to blur it out or you can decide that no, that's way too arty that I screw
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:03.600]   that up. It's kind of magical when you get to push that slider to one side or the other and suddenly
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:07.760]   focus the background or unfocused the background would be so miss however, Andy, if I didn't point
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.800]   out that you've had that feature in your Samsung phone for a year or two. Yeah, but it doesn't work
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:18.480]   as well. It does not work as well. I do. I will admit and I and if you're if you decide you really
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:25.200]   like it, FOCOS is a lot better. Yes. I mean, it is any anything you shot in portrait mode ever,
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:33.120]   you can open up in FOCOS. That's FOCOS and it is you can control where it's focusing. You get this
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:37.600]   great 3D view that if you want to look at what's actually happening there. So it's just a it's
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:41.920]   one of the best photo apps or photo editing apps, in my opinion, of just being able to work with
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.160]   that. And I think that Apple needed to take more notes or just buy that team and buy that company
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.840]   and take their do you have to do? I mean, if you could shoot with halide and edit and focus,
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.480]   I mean, I thought would be the best camera app ever. Yeah, but you can because you can download all
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:59:01.840]   of those. You can also do the the aperture shifting in like on your Mac later too, as long as you
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.440]   shot with an iPhone XS or an iPhone XS. Oh, that's interesting. That editing is available everywhere.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:10.080]   And the one thing I really like is that that camera team really did take a ton of really
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:14.880]   expensive cameras and a really expensive lenses and they're not just applying a blur. In the early
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.160]   days of portrait mode, they just everyone just did a disc blur and they just chose a
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.440]   disc blur of their choice and applied it to a segmentation mask with smaller or greater amount
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:27.040]   of depth data to it depending on what sort of camera they were shooting with. But they created
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:31.920]   a computational model for a lens and it's got its own characteristics and it will it will
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:37.440]   deform as it goes outside. Like I'll get a bit of a fisheye to it as it goes further out. And if
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:41.120]   there's layers of light, it knows how to treat all those different layers of light separately when
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:45.440]   it when it sort of models the way the bokeh looks and it's it's pretty cool technology.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:51.280]   I also love the fact that during the keynote, they made of they didn't mention it, but all the
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:56.560]   demo pictures were almost all of them, I think, were of people. And it was hard not to notice that
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:02.960]   they had a full range of skin tones in the models there. And so they didn't have to hide behind a
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.360]   limitation they have worries. It's we are our white engineers kind of optimize without even
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:12.320]   really thinking about it happen to optimize it for light colored skin and dark colored skin.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.520]   We're not really bringing out the full tonality of the image. But that's that's something that
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:24.320]   people are kind of should expect any camera to handle very, very well in 2018. And clearly,
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.920]   Apple was had a certain amount of pride in having done all that work. Yeah,
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.800]   the funny thing to me is when you read it, Austin. Go ahead, go ahead. I was gonna say,
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.880]   when you read Austin man's review, he takes it on these great photo walks every time. And he said,
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.720]   it's with the new HDR smart HDR feature, it's almost impossible to take a silhouette because
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:48.480]   it'll just still expose dark air. Yeah, I did notice that the shots they shot with the XR were
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.480]   playing safe with like the hair. I mean, there was hats, there were clean edges. Like the they didn't
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.840]   show as much of the detail, which I do think is going to be the most challenging thing for the XR
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:06.640]   or the 10 R or whatever, rather than the 10s and 10s Max. I think that they will probably handle
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.200]   because they have that more camera on that side. They're gonna I think they're gonna handle the
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.720]   the Boca better, you know, in the in the fine details, wispy hair, the small details, because I
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.040]   did feel like when we saw it, that's the telltale, when they don't shoot pictures with it, you know
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.920]   that there's they're shooting around something, in my opinion, like they will show wispy hair if
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:31.520]   it can do wispy hair. Right. Yeah, benchmarks are pretty darn good. I mean, in fact, in some cases,
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:38.880]   this performs your MacBook. If you have the early MacBook, your core M processor can't keep up,
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:47.120]   especially on Geekbench 4, where the iPhone 10s Max is getting a multi core a single core
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:52.160]   performance of $21,967. That's that's pretty darn fast. There's one thing worth warning people
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.240]   about though, and that is like there are very few people in this world who actually actually know
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.320]   how to do benchmarks like a nan tank is a very big standout. So a lot of the benchmarks you get,
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.920]   right? People who don't understand benchmarks. And also the chips are getting so complicated,
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:10.800]   like you're not hitting a chip anymore. You're hitting a heck of a decoding block or encoding block
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.440]   or an accelerator. And it's very hard to tell even for experts what they're actually hitting on a
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.400]   chip. And that's that's true for a lot of the other technology in these phones and in the numbers,
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.480]   like app launching. Are you launching those apps fast or is the machine learning could
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.880]   have anticipated what app to preload into memory that you're getting the app for? It's not getting
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.320]   easier. It turns out that the traffic manager in a seat that in an operating system is becoming
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.600]   as important as the speed of the CPU itself, figuring out how do I split this this task amongst
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.560]   the many processors that are inside this machine to get the fastest result. And oftentimes you have
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:50.320]   you've old style benchmarking that is just gonna just gonna do some strict math that is really can't
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:59.760]   show off a real world situation in which the entire the entire board can be used to be thrown
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.160]   at that problem and get the fastest result, which is what would happen if you're actually trying to
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.960]   render an image that you're displaying in a mobile browser. So with grain of salt,
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.720]   it's the only thing that's really important is does it feel faster, does it not feel faster,
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.440]   because you're never going to you're never going to be impressed at a chart, just like you're not
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.160]   going to be impressed with the numbers that the XO provides about a camera, you're going to be
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:28.000]   impressed with the results you're getting from it. So yeah, yeah, Apple for years that controller
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.680]   has been their secret sauce for several years on the A series. What about battery life? You've
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.280]   had it longer than anyone at this point, Renee, what are you getting? Mine, mine's been really good.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.800]   I mean, some people are having the usual problem where they just update to it and it's churning
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:47.360]   through all sorts of library updates or downloading apps and never judge battery life on the first
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.080]   few days. So there are some complaints. Apple did go to a slightly smaller battery, which always
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:57.040]   disappoints me because they are getting, according to Apple's test, and Apple does really rigorous
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.840]   tests. If you compare Apple to a lot of industry tests, they do pretty honest assessments based
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.280]   on what they say on the tennis max. But not the tennis max. No, it's a bigger battery, but
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.160]   they get going to seven nanometer, gave them so many efficiencies and the new software gives them
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:17.280]   so many efficiencies that overall you get about a half an hour more. I just think we're beyond
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.680]   those days when Steve Jobs announced the iPhone and you're doing light, you're doing email and
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:26.560]   light web browsing. We're hitting the GPS and the screen and the data so often and everything from
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.600]   Instagram to Facebook to Pokemon to our augmented reality is just hitting these phones like a
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.600]   ton of bricks. So I'm always at the camp of Apple. Apple's theory is that you use your phone a lot,
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.280]   so you want to make it as light as possible. So we're going to go for the same amount of battery
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.840]   life and always optimize for the usability of being able to carry your phone for a long time.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.280]   And I wish they would move that line a little bit and instead of going,
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.920]   okay, we just leave the way the same and give me much better battery life this year.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:02.400]   Okay, I think we've covered the phone. Let's take a break and do the watch.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.680]   Oh, there's one last thing that we should make for the phone is that some people are having
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:11.920]   some weirdness with LTE and Wi-Fi networks. So Apple's gone all in on Intel modems.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   They're feud with Qualcomm is recent. They don't want to do business with it.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.440]   People who aren't used to Intel modems, which are mostly CDMA people, are having some quirks,
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.200]   like different bars and things like that. I'm guessing there'll be a carrier update as soon as
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.520]   they suck in is enough data and they can figure out exactly what's going on. And that'll all be
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.760]   fine because people who have reached nuked their phone and started over have been fine. So it
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.640]   might just be legacy carrier settings that are messing things around. For Wi-Fi, it looks like
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.960]   it's jumping on 2.4 gigahertz instead of 5 gigahertz if it has the opportunity.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:46.800]   And if you turn that off, it works fine. Or again, if you nuke your settings and start over,
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.720]   it works fine. But I'm guessing there'll be a quick update to sort of sort all that stuff out.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:56.960]   Okay. Yeah. That relationship is now this marriage cannot be saved. Now the Qualcomm is suing Apple.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:03.040]   They're suing Apple. Claiming that Apple handed over Qualcomm's modem secrets to Intel,
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:10.320]   or at least did not secure their secrets well enough to prevent Intel from getting access to them.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.440]   That's not what you do with a company that you think you're going to be in business with for the
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.560]   next four or five years. That's a negotiating point for future divorce settlement. Yeah.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:23.280]   Yeah. This relationship cannot be saved. I think it's pretty clear.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:30.080]   And that's too bad because really the issue is not so much now it's 5 when 5G gets here.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:37.440]   And I guess Apple at this point is going to have to do their own 5G modems. Intel doesn't seem to
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.360]   have a very good model. Well, there's well, I don't think I don't think Qualcomm is the only
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:45.280]   or and Intel are the only ones doing 5G. I think there's a couple. Yeah. Couple players. But
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:54.240]   and also creating a creating a modem is so as such a big, all a sticky wax for them to have to
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:00.800]   manage at Apple. I can't imagine them wanting to take that on unless they unless they unless
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.520]   the all every alternative were even worse than trying to get this big ball of sticky wax off of
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.800]   your hands and do right shape. This is not if this isn't about when they create their own CPUs for
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:18.000]   iOS devices, there's nothing but upside they get to build a thing a CPU that's absolutely tailored
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.200]   for the things they want the iPhone to do. But with a modem, it's not you can't build a modem
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:28.000]   that way. It has to be tailored to the things that every network in the world wants to do.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.600]   And you do not want the headlines on the on a launch day being that it's fine. So long as you
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:39.840]   don't want to dial a phone number with a with a seven or four in it or actually transact graphics
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.680]   in any way, it's going to be so tricky that why would they want to do that? Are you supporting
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:47.600]   T mobile frequency 666? That's only when I need 666 T model, support it.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:54.320]   Let's take a little break. We'll talk about the watch. I got the 44 millimeter and Apple did me a
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:08:01.600]   really a solid because I foolishly bought the edition for the last two years running the ceramic
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:07.440]   very expensive watch. Not really thinking that gosh, you know, in a year I'm going to replace it.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:13.760]   So this time I got the aluminum I didn't even get the stainless steel is like screw it. I mean
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.720]   what's the cheapest I can get? And the good news is it still works with all my watch bands. I
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.320]   like the 44 millimeter. We'll talk about that in just a second. And there's a lot
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.800]   surprisingly a lot to talk about. I think the general consensus I'm seeing and I know you agree
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:36.800]   Renee is that this is finally the the Apple Watch everybody wants. You know, they finally got it
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:42.080]   I mean just right. The analogy is iPhone four and I think that's so true not because it's a
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.560]   radical redesign but because it's so close to the independence that came in iPhone five. Yeah.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.520]   Yeah. Yeah. It's it's I have to say and I've been using walkie talkie with Lisa. Anyway,
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.680]   we'll talk about that. She'll probably walkie talkie me during this. That our show today brought to
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.320]   you by and they come. It's so funny. Gazelle comes back every time there's a new iPhone because they
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:04.960]   know you're eyeing and the only thing to be new pixels to and there's gonna be new crumbles.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:11.760]   You're eyeing these new devices and thinking if only I could get myself one. Well trade in your
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.680]   old device for cash and then you can buy a brand new iPhone or save and get a certified pre-owned
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.800]   one. That's Gazelle dot com and go there right now Gazelle dot com and find out instantly what
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:27.440]   your old device is worth. They'll give you an instant quote and they stand by it which I love
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.320]   for 30 days. So you got time figure out. Yeah. What am I going to do? How am I going to handle this?
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:37.360]   We even have time to keep the old phone transfer the date over and then send it to Gazelle. Shipping
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:44.320]   is free. The payment is fast, fast, fast. Not just iPhones but Samsung Galaxy S9s. If you're saying
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:50.560]   I wish I hadn't bought that. I want an XS Max or an iPhone 8 or an iPhone 10. And by the way this is
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.040]   a great place to get replacement phones or for your kids. I don't know if your kids are like mine
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:01.520]   and burn through phones. Go buy a certified pre-owned device at Gazelle. They have an incredible
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.840]   selection and this is a good time to do it because this is when all the trade ins are coming in.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.800]   Shop for iPhones 6 through 10 for iPads. Yes, there's new iPads coming. So check out the
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:18.480]   standard Air Mini and Pro models for laptops. We've got MacBook Air and Pro. Even Android
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:25.200]   devices with Galaxy phones. Each device of course fully inspected back by a 30 day return policy
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.520]   and sold without a carrier contract. But they will work on all the major carriers in the US.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.240]   Gazelle provides financing on all devices at checkout. You just check that box. It says,
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.840]   yeah, I want financing with a firm. Very fast, very easy. If you've done it before, you know,
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.840]   you just provide some basic information. You approval instant. You can pay off at three,
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.400]   six or 12 months with easy monthly payments through bank transfer check or debit card.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.280]   Just you can do that right at checkout. Don't miss out on getting the best value on certified
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:02.880]   pre-owned devices to at Gazelle.com. G-A-Z-E-L-L-E. It's that time of year again. It's a Gazelle
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:09.440]   time of year. All the new stuff comes out. Time to Gazelle the old. Gazelle out the old and Gazelle
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:18.400]   in the new. How about that? Gazelle.com. Which watch face are you using, Renee?
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:25.440]   I am using the... Where is it right here? Oh, I'm using... I can't even twist my arm the
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.320]   right way. It's hard to show. It's hard to not tap it. Yeah. I'm using the infograph because it's new.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:36.640]   Yes. And it has more complications than Carter has little liver pills. I'm calling it super complicated.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.720]   Yeah. Super complicated. Some people are complaining that you can't get the old normal
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.520]   complications like the messages or the email ones. Those haven't been super complicated yet.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.880]   I'm guessing when Apple goes through those and redoes them all, we'll get options for them.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.040]   And there's some things like Pokemon Go for some reason. I don't know. Can you get your...
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.680]   They just have to update for the new super complication template.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:01.440]   Yeah. Oh, I get it. So it literally is a new super complication. Apple never called it that,
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.640]   but it's a watch thing. And I feel clever putting those words together in my own brain.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.600]   You know what I love? One of the things I really love, I just think this is so cool,
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:16.400]   is you normally flip it up to look at it. But if it's off, you can slowly twist the dial and it
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.200]   gets slowly, gets brighter. It goes from dim to bright. So if you're in a theater somewhere where
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.040]   you don't want to bug people, I just think that's... It's little things like that.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.960]   Is that a watch OS 5 thing or is that something?
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   Oh, that was last year, I believe. Oh, is that last year? This is the other question is,
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:39.200]   how much of what I'm getting in the series 4 Apple Watch is everybody getting? First is
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:45.200]   walkie-talkie. Is that... So what you're getting exclusively is the Infograph, the Infograph
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:51.120]   modular watch face, the fall detection, and the echocardiogram feature when that gets turned on.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:56.720]   You're also getting better reception because it has a RF transparent back now as well as a front.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:02.320]   So you're getting better cellular reception. And it's got a new technology in the watch face
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.680]   that allows it to do things like do a lower refresh rate on photographs as opposed to animations,
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.480]   so it can save more power and a bunch of other interesting things.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.480]   So that's why Lisa, because I gave her my old series 3, she can't get the Infograph on there.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.840]   No, no, it's just so big. You really do. I mean, I don't know how
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.320]   much bigger the screen is, but it's enough. It's a little bit bigger.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:33.520]   That size millimeters matter, so it's 44 now. Yeah, she's wearing the 42 instead of 38.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.840]   And there's a 40 instead. The new small one is a 49 or 38.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.360]   But the important thing is their band compatible Leo. I don't have to fall into a fetal position
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:47.040]   and just cry. Yeah, I know I was so relieved and I'm sure you were really, really, really
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:54.320]   too. We're all at least 20% expecting to hear the words watch dongle, watch band dongle.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.160]   Oh, God. And it's not in the box.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.240]   Watch it. It's definitely for 70 bucks.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.240]   Tell me about the fall detection. I've been hesitant to turn that on because
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:10.160]   I don't want my, it does warn you. It says, if you will work out aggressively,
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.200]   you might not want to turn this on because it might think you've fallen when you've just,
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:19.920]   you're just doing kettlebells. Yeah, no. So it's not on by default. So you can turn it on,
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.840]   but then it will get false positives. If you do motions that mimic what it thinks it should
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:27.360]   see when you're falling, you can say, I'm not falling though and start to train it to say,
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.320]   that's not a fall. Oh, okay. Do you have your ears on?
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.760]   I turned my non because I very stupidly did some break fall tests on the New York sidewalks
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:42.000]   in the rain in my video. I actually got seen and yelled at by people. So that was fine.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.200]   And it was painful because the first couple of times I did it, I didn't realize I had to turn
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:51.120]   it on first. Oh, it wasn't working. And then I turned it on first. I draw all of my time.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.200]   Did you just throw yourself to the ground? I thought it's like judo, ready to kick my leg out,
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:02.560]   and then did a break fall. Renee Renee if only Ren had waited a few months to move to Apple,
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:08.080]   and she could have just done one on the roller derby. One game, one roller derby bout with this,
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:12.800]   and test how the fall of detection worked. Oh, we've been. Yeah, I know she would have just
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.160]   closed my knee and she drove by on her skates. I mean, one of those two things would have happened.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:20.800]   I got to try to find this video now of Renee. It's my watch. It's my Apple Watch.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:29.360]   Throwing himself to the ground. Probably also Twittered it.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:35.760]   So I guess I'll turn it on then because it doesn't immediately call 911. No. Yeah,
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.520]   it offers you the choice. And then again, you can say no false positive false positive. Yeah.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.720]   Okay, so you have a chance.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:47.360]   But it's good technology. I mean, I've had, like I said in my review, I've had family members
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.200]   who literally fell and that was the beginning of the end for them because they never recovered.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.760]   They lost their mobility. They lost their independence. And I've had friends who've been like dumb
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.600]   and I'll say dumb, dumb enough to go mountain biking by themselves and got thrown off their
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:04.320]   bikes and you know, not had a happy time getting back to their bike and with limbs and stuff trying
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.480]   to get back to civilization. And you maybe this won't help everybody. But if there's a chance
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.880]   that will give them a better odds of being detected of contacting people, then to me, that's miraculous.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.440]   Yeah. And that's, and was a really interesting move that if you put your age into the health app
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:23.040]   by default, if you're a year 65 or older, by default, fault detection is turned on. Otherwise,
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:27.600]   it's default turned off. Okay, I have found it, ladies and gentlemen, I now give you Rene Richie
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:33.920]   throwing himself. 30 seconds throwing himself to the ground. It'll only generate a PDF report
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:38.320]   that you can send it to your cardiologist. In other words, it's still extremely limited.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.720]   But it can tell you if you're hard to immediately tap to call emergency services and alert your
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:47.840]   emergency contacts, critically, if you don't start moving in and try to get out right there.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.520]   Yeah, there's long term data as part of your overall medical plan. Again, save lives.
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:58.160]   So can the new fall detection, which uses a new accelerometer and gyroscope to determine
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:02.160]   if you take a fall and may require emergency. That would take like three or four.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:09.760]   It is fortunately, it's an ice, it's icy ground. It's so raining. So I had to go get changed after the
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.160]   new fall detection, which usually means a lot longer.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:19.360]   So how many business cards from lawyers did you collect in the next three minutes after that
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:24.640]   fall? I totally, I totally stole that flash from the Lucasfilm guy on Twitter.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:32.560]   Next time, get a helmet. Okay. Yeah. Did people come rushing to your aid or no, it's New York.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:37.360]   They said, get up, buddy. No, but I think it's from some people across the street going,
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:45.040]   what are you doing? Please stop that. They texted you. So, okay. So I am going to turn that on
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:52.320]   because I'm just worried. I'm just not like I'm working out that hard. I'm just, I don't want,
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:56.800]   you know, my loved ones in 911 to get a call saying Leo's fallen and he can't get up.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.520]   But I do think that that is a really good idea. I think it's a great feature.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.160]   And the amount of math they put into it, trying to detect an actual fall from
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:12.640]   from all the different ways it can get a shock from things that don't involve falling down,
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.320]   all the metrics they're collecting about what the body is doing, what kind of impact it is.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.840]   It really makes you think about all the other ways that it can help out. Like a few weeks ago,
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.880]   I learned about I think it's called the fencing response, where if someone has been basically
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:32.400]   knocked out for some neurological reason, oftentimes like it's called the fencing response because
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.000]   their arm just simply, one arm just really shoots out like this as they go back.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.640]   And it doesn't, you know, it's not for balances for some reason that arm shoots out.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.160]   And well, that happens to be your wristwatch arm. So that plus other data to figure out that,
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:52.800]   no, he is, he or she has, has, is experiencing something that we almost always associate with
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:56.960]   someone who's been knocked unconscious. So we really need to get on this really quickly.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:00.640]   So it's impressive to see how these proactive features could work out the next couple of years.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   I would just, I would just love to see how they behind the scenes for figuring this out.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.440]   Let me just put it in the way it is other than research.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:13.120]   Imagine all people falling. No, I just imagine like all these people are responding to great
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.560]   look, and they require. I'm sorry. I'm playing the video. Don't just ignore me.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:23.600]   I just imagine these people answering crazy. My God, what, what, great luck. We get to actually
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.800]   be inside the spaceship in a super secret lab will be under NDA. This is going to be great.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:58.640]   Not only that, okay, see this flight is stairs.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.800]   So I'm going to be in the
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.800]   first phase of the flight.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:40.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.800]   I'm going to be in the first phase of the flight.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.800]   I did notice this has 12 gigabytes of storage.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.800]   Isn't that more than the old watch or no?
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.800]   I think the old one had eight.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.800]   That's good because I'm putting podcasts on here,
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.800]   putting music on here, and I'm putting my audio books on here.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.800]   I'm using it.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.800]   I actually use 10 gigs on this thing.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:16.800]   That's amazing that I have a 10 gigabyte storage in my wrist.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   It's in my pod.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.800]   I love it that I can listen to audio books from this.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.800]   If your podcast listener, same thing.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.800]   It's just really a killer feature.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.800]   I remember the 10th anniversary of the iPod.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   They released a poster of the hammer throwing woman from the
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:36.800]   1984 commercial when they added in digitally.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:40.800]   She's got an iPod on her hip and inspired headphones.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.800]   I was looking at mine on my wall and I've been looking at the other
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:46.800]   day and thinking that now you -- I hope they do it again.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   Only now she's got air pods in and she's got an Apple watch
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.800]   and nothing else.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   In fact, I -- so I paired it, of course, to my air pods,
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.800]   but it doesn't have to be air pods.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.800]   I have a Bluetooth speaker and I compare it to that.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.800]   I can actually listen to music from my Apple watch without the help
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.800]   of an iPhone.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.800]   I feel like here, let me play my chill mix here.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.800]   It sounds so good.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.800]   And you could play Mac Break Weekly because there's a podcast app now.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.800]   Yes.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.800]   The Pocketcast could do that before, right?
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:23.800]   They could, but I mean, I'm so good overcast, but they weren't
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.800]   elegant solutions and now it's almost like a first-class citizen
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.800]   and there's a new overcast and a new pocketcast if you prefer those.
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:30.800]   Good.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.800]   How loud is the speaker from your points of view?
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.800]   I listened to it in the store.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:40.800]   Like, I forget -- someone was 12 feet away from me and I could hear
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.800]   their conversation on the phone perfectly.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.800]   Well, let me just walk and talk to Elisa.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.800]   And you can hear -- I'm just going to connect to my wife here real
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:48.800]   quickly.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:52.800]   Hey, Elisa, can you talk to me on the air just so that we can hear
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.800]   it and left you're in a call, in which case I'm sorry and I'll
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.800]   shut up now.
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.800]   That's the only problem with walkie-talkie.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:22:59.800]   Last time I used it.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:00.800]   Oh, she's eating?
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.800]   It's lunchtime?
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.800]   Okay.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.800]   So we should get one back pretty quick.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.800]   It has an ice-big button.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.800]   It's fairly loud when you talk.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   I'm going to turn it all the way up.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.800]   And once you get the connection, there's a little -- I guess
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.800]   she's busy, but there's a little time between the first time you
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800]   use it and connecting.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.800]   It says looking for Elisa looking.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:21.800]   But then once you've got it, it's instantaneous back and forth.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:22.800]   It's really cool.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.800]   It's weird, though, because if you're used to a call -- I say goodbye
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.800]   without remembering to press the button.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.800]   And then I realize --
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.800]   Right.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.800]   -- I'm saying goodbye to myself.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.800]   You can have multiple people too.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.800]   So you can have -- I have two people because I only know two
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.800]   people wearing watches right now, but you can add as many as you
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.800]   want.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.800]   And the first time you press the -- I made put the walkie-talkie
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:44.800]   complication on the front face, of course, of my info graph.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.800]   And the first time you press it, it says, okay, who do you want to
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800]   talk with?
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.800]   So you actually -- it's kind of like an ex-telephone on your --
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.800]   What was hilarious to me is that Georgia and her husband were
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.800]   setting it up, and her husband's like, make sure you have walkie
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   talk, and this is going to be amazing.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   And she's like, yes, presses it.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   Can I have a tea, please?
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.800]   And he's like, no!
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.800]   [laughter]
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.800]   Because that's all he's going to get now.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.800]   All morning and night.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.800]   Can I have a tea, please?
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800]   Can you get me tea?
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.800]   Can you get me tea?
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:08.800]   Can you get me a beer?
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.800]   It's basically her little ring bell now.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.800]   [laughter]
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.800]   Don't tell Lisa that.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   No, I really like that.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.800]   How about sales on the iPhone, the new iPhones, and the new Apple
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:21.800]   watches?
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.800]   I know Apple isn't going to say anything for at least a quarter
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:27.800]   if at all, but analysts are saying, for instance, Ming Chi Quo says
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.800]   the 10S Max, significantly outselling the 10S.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.800]   The most popular is -- I don't know how he knows this.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.800]   The most popular is the 256 gig version.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.800]   I'm not surprised to hear that.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:45.800]   The 512 is in severe shortage because only Samsung is providing,
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:48.800]   I guess, the storage.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:51.800]   I don't know how much of this is all crazy.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.800]   I think pre-orders are usually early adopters, though.
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.800]   It's the geeks who are buying them, and geeks like to go big.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.800]   Quo does say the XR will be a hot seller with more customers
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.800]   upgrading to that model than the iPhone 8.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.800]   I want those colors, Leo.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.800]   I'm so -- John, I think the XR is going to be a really nice phone.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.800]   I think a lot of people are going to want that.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.800]   I've even told friends who said, "Oh, should I get the new iPhone?"
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:13.800]   I've said, "Wait.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.800]   If you can wait until next month, I would take a look at the 10R."
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.800]   It looks gorgeous, and I think they use dark magic to fit an LCD screen
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.800]   into those weird curves.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.800]   You see --
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.800]   And I was planning to get the 512, but I have to say that
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.800]   I looked at my phone --
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:29.800]   You don't use that much.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.800]   I'm like, "I'm at 150 out of 256."
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.800]   I don't know if I really needed 512.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.800]   You need to take more 4K video, Alex Lindsey.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.800]   What was I thinking?
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:42.800]   It's pretty cool.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   You also need to buy more 4K HDR content off the iTunes Store.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.800]   It comes.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.800]   It's not wonderful library.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   So that's the one difference is that -- and this is controversial.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:55.800]   The 10R does not have HDR.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.800]   I mean, Apple has claimed LCD screens with HDR before,
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.800]   like with the iPad, but they've really backed off of it.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.800]   A lot of TV manufacturers say they do LCD with HDR.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.800]   What happens is with OLED, it gets much deeper blacks, but it's not as bright.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.800]   So they sort of say, "Okay, you can have this standard."
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.800]   And LCDs can't get the black levels, but they can go bright.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.800]   So they say, "You can have this standard."
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:18.800]   And we'll sort of just make everyone allow it to say HDR.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:23.800]   But I think a lot of people will say you really have to have a very wide range of tones,
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:28.800]   you know, from details in the shadows to details in the highlights to claim HDR.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.800]   And Apple, I think, is backed away from that a little bit, but other people still want to talk about it.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.800]   But HDR is super important to you, then.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.800]   You're going to have an HDR pipeline, but the display, you're going to have to make up your own mind about it.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.800]   Tell me about the ECG.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.800]   It will be enabled later in the year or --
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.800]   Yeah, in the U.S.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.800]   So the FDA has approved that as far as I know, no other regional bodies have approved it,
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.800]   although Apple has taken it to a lot of them, so hopefully that'll be soon.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.800]   And the Apple show up on your Apple Watch.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   You'll press the button.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.800]   You'll hold your finger to the titanium electrode on the digital crown.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.800]   The other part of it is on the back of the wrist monitor.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:09.800]   Some people were worried that there's only one visible optical sensor, but there's still four sensors.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   They just put them all together in a cluster instead of spreading them out.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:18.800]   So now you have the four sensors for optical in the middle, the electrodes all around it in that band,
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:24.800]   and that plus your finger on the crown closed the loop, and you get what's effectively a one-pad ECG.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.800]   Most people, if you go to physicals, I think you get like 12 pads for regular.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.800]   This is a live course, Cardia, which is also too context.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:39.800]   I talked on Sunday about a post from a cardiac doctor on medium saying,
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:40.800]   "It makes me nervous.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:47.800]   A lot of self-diagnosis going on, giving healthy people unnecessary tests is maybe not a good idea."
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.800]   So ECG's produce fairly high.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:57.800]   Even a 12 lead, electrocardia gram produces 10% false positive, he says.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:06.800]   So false positives may cause, and now millions of people be using this may cause over medication, over concern.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.800]   Yeah, so Apple's really, the way they pitch it is they're really concerned about this.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:13.800]   And I should point out that I think everybody on that team is a doctor.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.800]   The person who running it is a doctor who does 20% hospital time.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.800]   The person who does marketing for it's a doctor who does 20%.
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:24.800]   They are staffed to the gills with really prestigious doctors on that team and cardiologists,
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   and they'll all tell you that what this is meant to do is if you are with a cardiologist
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:32.800]   and you are trying to track down issues that have been difficult to track down,
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.800]   you can do these at a recommended intervals.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.800]   And what it does is create a PDF file that you then mail to your cardiologist,
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.800]   and they have that data.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.800]   It benefits you in that you have constant access to it and can do it at any time.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:56.800]   It's not for just you and me to do to say, hey, how's our heart doing?
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.800]   I mean, I looked at the results.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:28:59.800]   I mean, I tried it.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.800]   I looked at the results and I can't get.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.800]   I don't know what that means.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.800]   I have one of those cardiologists in my doctor, but you know,
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   Jeff Jarvis, who has been diagnosed with AFib and is in treatment for AFib,
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.800]   his cardiologist said, get the cardia, which will be very similar to this.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.800]   I don't know.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.800]   It's not flat.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:16.800]   You're supposed to send it to it.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:17.800]   Yeah, I'm alive.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:18.800]   Let me just try.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.800]   I think Lisa is now.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.800]   Hey, baby, can you hear me?
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.800]   Let me just see if the says connecting to Lisa.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.800]   Let's just see if the walkie talkie feature is working.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.800]   New watch.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.800]   Who this?
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.800]   New watch.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.800]   Who it is?
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:36.800]   I like that.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.800]   Oh, Andy, you got to Instagram that.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.800]   That's brilliant.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.800]   I guess I guess I guess I'm not.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:48.800]   She came in from that I could do this, but I guess she's busy again.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:55.800]   So anyway, you get the new low heart rate and the new typically AFib heart rate detection
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.800]   alerts that are probably most valuable.
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:00.800]   And those you can't instigate, those will just come to you if they detect something.
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.800]   So in the past, it's not detected if your heart rate, you weren't doing anything,
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.800]   but you're like 220.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.800]   Now if it goes below, what is it?
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:09.800]   80 or 40?
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.800]   Is that the threshold?
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.800]   You can set a threshold for it.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:14.800]   That's nice.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:20.400]   It's the I really have to consider the EKG feature to be marketing until proven otherwise
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.800]   for a couple of reasons.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.800]   I've no doubt that Apple believes in it, but in terms of what you should expect from
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:32.800]   a watch with the EKG function, I find out that there have been their number one.
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:38.200]   There is the obvious concern about people coming in with concern, healthy people coming
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.200]   in with concerns.
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:45.240]   The basic principle of medicine continues to be that you don't treat healthy people,
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:50.880]   you treat people who have symptoms, and there will not be a there's no device that can tell
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:54.440]   you you're going to have a heart attack, you're going to have a stroke and prevent that from
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:55.440]   happening.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.720]   As a matter of fact, I think it was the US Preventative Services Task Force.
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:04.640]   I might be mixing up my agencies, but I think there are the people who had done a study or
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:09.880]   a recommendation where they had looked at people who had been assigned the people who had who
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:14.880]   had AFib who had been assigned the use of actual like regular professional grade monitors
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.840]   to wear 24/7.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:22.520]   And after you following a couple hundred people for a year, their findings were that the people
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:27.000]   who had these devices did not have a lower incidence of stroke heart attack, the sort
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.480]   of stuff that you were trying to prevent as the control group.
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:37.800]   They're also the, again, the outstanding principle that you treat people who come in with a symptom,
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.080]   you don't treat people who come in saying that they're watched, told them that there
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:44.040]   might be having some heart problems right now.
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:50.920]   And so the drugs that a doctor might give you because you're watching and looking at
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:56.000]   this PDF information might lead him to conclude that, him or her to conclude that perhaps
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.440]   it wouldn't be a bad thing for this person to be on a medication.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.440]   The medication you're given for AFib actually has real side effects, whereas we don't have
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:09.080]   proven side effects of not having access to regular EKG devices.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:12.480]   And also it has to be pointed out that it was approved by the FDA, but the approval came
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.640]   in a day before.
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:23.640]   And also it was approved under a special program that the FDA put up to make sure that to encourage
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:29.040]   software, really new next level sort of stuff with software for health devices.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:32.760]   So Apple was one of the companies, a while back, that was approved to say, hey, we will
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:39.840]   give you access to, not it would be wrong to call the fast track program, but you have
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:44.800]   proven that you know what you're doing and therefore we will give you access to an alternative
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.880]   means of getting approval for something.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:51.360]   So they really haven't proven that this thing does what it's supposed to do yet.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:56.000]   It's been approved as a de novo class two device, which means that there isn't any precedent
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.720]   to lean on to suggest to cite when they say this will work or this will not work.
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:06.280]   So but we're saying it's interesting and potentially useful enough that we want to
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:10.480]   put it forward because we don't think it's going to be under the under certain conditions
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:14.360]   that we have listed in this filing document, even though we are not necessary, we're not
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:19.240]   yet ready to say that this is a really, really healthy important device yet.
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:24.980]   So maybe I made it sound a little bit too harsh when I said I consider it marketing until
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:26.220]   proven otherwise.
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:31.160]   But right now we don't know how effective this tool is going to be.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.060]   We don't know if it's going to save lives.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:39.800]   We don't know if it'll even neck up a match up with the diagnostic tool that the more conservative
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:44.140]   people are mentioning that, like Renee said, if you are at if you have been diagnosed with
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:49.720]   AFib, this is a way to collect data as you go and prepare it for your doctor.
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.160]   So this is not so if someone's if someone's expecting that, wow, I was going to have a
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.060]   heart attack where I was going to have a stroke.
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:34:01.580]   But thanks to my magic Apple watch, it threw up the emoji for you're about to have a stroke,
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:03.220]   get to a doctor right now.
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.740]   And I was able to go to the doctor and prevent the stroke.
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:06.860]   It's not going to be that yet.
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:09.580]   We don't have any any evidence of that.
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.140]   And it's not going to happen for another couple of years.
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.820]   I think you're completely appropriate, Andy.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:15.300]   It's appropriate to be a little skeptical.
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:20.540]   You know, it's one thing for Apple's reality distortion field and marketing, which is unparalleled
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:23.760]   to really promote, you know, stuff and make us all want it.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.000]   And it's it's working for us.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.400]   But when you when you're getting into these areas of literally life or death, you know,
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.400]   a little little skepticism is appropriate.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:37.600]   And I'm not saying, yeah, I should call and I really do also want to qualify.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:43.320]   I'm mostly talking to other to other journalists and other people who are commenting about this
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:47.560]   that really have been making it sound as though you're getting a you have two hours to get
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.440]   to a hospital before the heart attack hits.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.220]   I don't think that Apple has been that explicit.
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:55.060]   I'm sure they have gave would be very very upset with them if they did.
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:56.500]   What Renee said is absolutely accurate.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:00.960]   What I've been hearing from closer sources that really is we have you have this tool available
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.500]   to you at hand.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:07.020]   If your doctor would like to have regular EKG readings from you and it's not it's not
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:12.140]   as good as a 12 12 conductor test that's usually administered by a technician who knows what
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:15.600]   knows how what to look at in the strip that's coming in.
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.220]   But it's handy that at the at a certain point at a certain time, you can actually take this
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:24.040]   right here without having to deal with a $200 copay.
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.440]   And by the way, the way, the way it's going to go ahead, Renee.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.080]   No, it's going to say I had a chance to talk to Apple's health team about it.
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.600]   And this is all interesting for them because they never intended to get into this business.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:35.840]   When they put a heart rate monitor on the original Apple watch, it was only because they
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:38.600]   could not figure out any other way to get an accurate calorie count.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:41.480]   And that's the only thing they wanted was an accurate calorie count.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:45.200]   And then as they kept testing it, they noticed that they were able to detect these things.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.320]   And at no point did they say, okay, let's make a health product.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.320]   Let's do this.
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.320]   Oh, this is interesting.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.920]   Oh, this, we've noticed these.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.920]   Is this real?
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.220]   Are we imagining this?
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.940]   And then very slowly and very carefully.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:59.360]   And again, by staffing that department to the gills with practicing doctors, they were
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.140]   trying to figure out what can we do?
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:02.140]   What can't we do?
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:03.140]   And most be beneficial?
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:04.140]   Will it not be beneficial?
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:06.940]   And I think it's a very slow and deliberate process.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:10.980]   And they say, you always see these news reports, breakthrough sensor for blood sugar, and Apple
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:13.820]   runs in and looks at them and they go, it's years away.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:15.500]   And they get as excited as we do.
[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:18.300]   But they said, whenever you see reports on the internet, what the actual you're doing
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:22.280]   to be able to ship that to millions of people is not the same as a press release from a
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.280]   startup.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.760]   So they're being very slow, very deliberate, and they're rolling out like one feature,
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.120]   I think, at a time on purpose.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.800]   But it's still very, very exciting.
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:33.280]   And I would even love to.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:37.360]   I don't know how Apple would possibly or Google or any other or Garmin would market
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.360]   this.
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:44.320]   But wouldn't it be great if there were some sort of a industry health standard black box
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:53.400]   sort of crash reporter feature that the watch will go into a certain like, I don't, again,
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.960]   I don't want to be indelicate about this, but it can probably detect that the pulse rate
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.600]   has ended and it's not because the watch has been removed from the person.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.540]   It's probably that, okay, this person has just died and we were watching this happen
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:09.040]   for the previous five or 10 minutes.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.840]   It would be interesting if there were a standard, like just like there's a flight recorder
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.680]   when you recover from a crash to find out what happened in those final minutes that
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:22.080]   I'm going to it's going to it's going to take all the data that it saw in the previous five
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:27.880]   or 10 minutes, save it to a standard file that then could be taken off of the watch and
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:36.080]   examined to find out here is exactly what happened or and or added to a database to
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:39.920]   maybe in a few years, figure out that no, we have seen enough people who drop dead of
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:47.680]   a heart attack that we can figure out that 62% of them had this data flow in off of their
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:51.200]   watch of two hours beforehand.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.600]   I think that there's an opportunity.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:56.920]   I mean, if they have studies, I mean, I'm definitely the game to be part of these studies,
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:59.760]   you know, especially with with and this is part of the importance of apples, you know,
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:03.720]   anonymization of the data is that I think that we're going to find that it's not just
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:07.080]   five or 10 minutes before, I think we're going to find that it's three months before, you
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:12.840]   know, six months before a year before we're seeing tremors in people's health that that
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.840]   slowly affects it and maybe it's not accurate enough to tell you something today, but getting
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:25.160]   all of that data and processing all that data over time could have a huge impact on on lifesaving
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:30.840]   techniques and being able to see things that we've never seen before as far as an early,
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:35.720]   you know, you're going to have to start dealing with a plaque in your in your heart now because
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.800]   we know that you're going to have a heart attack, you know, in six months.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:39.800]   I mean, not now.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:43.080]   We won't know that now, but let's say 10 years from now when we start gathering all that
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.040]   data, there's an opportunity to get gather data about about what we're doing and about
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.680]   how our bodies are operating at a level that we just never had before.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.800]   And I think that that I think it could make it make as much difference as almost anything
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:56.800]   else we're doing medically.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.840]   I don't think it's going to solve anything today, but I think that if they say have those
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.920]   studies, I would definitely recommend people take part of them.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:08.080]   I think that again, what makes that possible is apples.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.880]   So far, they're pretty good privacy approach.
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.960]   I do imagine Apple watch clear and then it just hits you with electricity.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:20.680]   I think that I would want to become a hacker just to find out if there's if there's somebody's
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:23.720]   somebody speaking at a conference who's saying sexist, horrible things, I would love to be
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:25.840]   able to use an illegal app.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:29.200]   And but but it's but it's but it does.
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:35.720]   It does it taser taser watch band and skin custom face, but it also underscores, I think
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.920]   the importance that we do need a federal law.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.680]   I think that says that the information that your devices collect about you belongs to
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:47.560]   you and cannot simply be horked into some database without your permission.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.680]   Again, and not just simply you have to opt in.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:54.600]   I'm saying it belongs to you because it actually ironically, that's what's going on right now.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:58.280]   There's a committee meeting on Apple's testifying at like,
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.280]   the trouble is going.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.280]   Twitter.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.280]   Yeah, but dribbles up there.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:07.120]   Yeah, that's that's kind of that's kind of interesting to the these companies.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.720]   There is a unified front from all these people who are competing with each other for personal
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:15.400]   data to say, yes, we absolutely need federal laws, a federal standard for this sort of
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.400]   stuff.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.880]   But at the same time, they really want to make sure that they get a voice in deciding
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:25.920]   what those federal laws are going to be because otherwise, California is going to give them
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:30.640]   really, really tough laws that are going to make it hard for them to do business.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.960]   So I'm glad these talk talks are happening.
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.680]   I hope that the at the end of this road, we don't have a very I don't I hope that we don't
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:44.160]   have the industry that is set up to exploit consumer data telling the federal government
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:47.360]   what kinds of data it's okay to have fewer regulations.
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.840]   So I can be I can be a little bit cynical about that.
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:57.720]   And you know, there are already several anecdotal stories of people's lives being saved or health
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.320]   being protected by by Apple Watch and judiciousness of it.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.840]   So it's not completely useless.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:06.680]   I think the I think you I think you nailed it, Alex.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:11.120]   It's all going to be about the data that's gathered and and what that data ends up meaning.
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:17.320]   And if it can be properly anonymized and you can I think this Apple's not the only company
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.560]   hoping to get this kind of stuff.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.480]   That's what all of this, you know, fitness industry is all about, right?
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:26.640]   It's collecting the big data and they're trying to figure out if they can learn something
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:27.640]   from what they know.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:32.680]   But the but the big question is is that we can't even keep our US bases safe.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:36.920]   So when you were talking about the the the the anonymization is so important and Apple's
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:41.360]   focus on that process is probably why they may end up with a lot more of the data, you
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:47.120]   know, right in their silo than other people because they're you know, because they're
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:51.040]   providing that that that service is as really part of what they do.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:54.840]   As we speak, Oculus is having a big event.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.200]   They've announced a number of things.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.320]   I'm just going to run through them real quickly.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:01.320]   A new Oculus stand alone VR headset.
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:07.560]   The Oculus Quest will be coming early next year for three ninety nine.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:08.560]   The most important part of that.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.560]   I mean, there's two things.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.560]   One is that it's wireless.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:14.040]   So you don't have to be tethered to a and you're getting most of the performance.
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.920]   I don't think it's quite the same performance as your computer, but it's like the
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:17.920]   go, right?
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:19.360]   But it's just an updated version of that, right?
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.320]   I think it's more powerful.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.320]   It's kind of it.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.560]   And I haven't gotten to use it.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.120]   So I don't know, but it's a two multi accessor.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.440]   Is it just like turning your head like the go?
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.440]   No, no, no, it won't.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:32.520]   And Oculus itself does the even the even the rift will do.
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:36.360]   They say this is the first wireless Oculus hardware to support positional tracking.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.360]   Oh, cool.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.480]   Cause I have a goal and you can turn around, but you can't move around.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.480]   Right.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:42.680]   No, no, this is this is outward.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.880]   This is inward to out or outward tracking.
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:48.760]   So it doesn't require the sensor.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.480]   So theoretically, now I don't know where it's going to go.
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:56.400]   I mean, again, we haven't had the opportunity to test it yet, but theoretically that approach
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.320]   means that you could deal with very large spaces.
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:03.720]   So you wouldn't be in the eight by space that you're in right now or the 10 by space
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.720]   that you're in by now.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.360]   You could, you could actually wander around a whole house or have, you know, a 30 foot
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.840]   or 40 foot square area that you could work inside of.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.800]   And that really changes an enormous number of things.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:16.800]   Right now, most of us.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:17.800]   Did you do the Ghostbusters yet?
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:18.800]   Alex?
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:21.520]   Well, I haven't done the, I haven't done the Ghostbusters.
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:22.520]   Thank you.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.120]   You put the computer on your back and you have the VR headset and you walk around.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.120]   So we didn't like it feels real though, cause like the steps creak and like this phrase
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:35.160]   missed on you and they change the smells and so it's an experience like a storefront.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.960]   You go in there, but it's wireless so that you don't have to worry about being tethered.
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:38.960]   Is there one around here?
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.360]   You should do that.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:44.400]   And yeah, the, I don't know, I don't know who's doing the Ghostbusters one.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.400]   I know that Nomadic is doing some, they're doing some tests coming up.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:50.120]   Leo, you probably ought to go down and check it out.
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.040]   They're replacing it with Star Wars at the places near me.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:54.320]   They're all taking down the Ghostbusters and putting up the Star Wars.
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.320]   Oh, is that the void?
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.040]   Is that, is that a, is that a void?
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:58.040]   The void.
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.040]   So the void.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.600]   The two big companies that are doing it are the void and nomadic VR and nomadic VR and
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:10.960]   nomadic, the void is doing a lot of these kind of movie experiences, nomadic VR, both of
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:19.160]   them, you know, is building kind of integrated solutions and both of them are pretty amazing.
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.320]   Really what you're doing here is building a kind of a low res tactile experience.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.440]   I think nomadic VR is going a little further with the tactile as far as things you can
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:30.520]   touch and the void is doing more with things you can hold.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.280]   I mean, that's a good question.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:34.360]   We reviewed this or talked about it on the screen savers.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:37.360]   I can't remember, but it feels like something we talked about.
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:38.360]   Probably.
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:43.960]   It's, it's a, but it, it, what, what you're doing is building an environment so you see
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:47.000]   something and when you reach out, you can actually touch it.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.680]   And so it's, it's a pretty, you know, a little bit of that makes a huge difference, doesn't
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.680]   it?
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:52.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.680]   Absolutely.
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:57.480]   And, and, and, but even without that, when you think about the, the, the outward tracking
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:02.240]   that's available in the new, in the new rift, you know, as that develops, it means that
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.520]   you could even, even if you don't have something you can touch, imagine having a virtual museum.
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.200]   You still can't touch the museum pieces either.
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:09.200]   Right.
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:10.200]   You can walk around them.
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.200]   So, you know, now can, the king tut exhibit can be everywhere.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.200]   Right.
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:16.680]   You know, and you can wander around it and get information.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:19.280]   It's been everywhere anyway.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.800]   Well, no, but I, it can be everywhere all at one time.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.040]   So think about having, when you think about the possibilities of this, think about having
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:34.200]   a museum, a museum that's just a 30 by 30 square that is, that is just empty and you
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.280]   tell it what museum you want to go to.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:38.680]   You know, like you tell, like, I want to go to a king tut museum.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:42.800]   I want to go to this kind of museum and you just walk in and maybe that 30 by 30 is just
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.800]   your house.
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:46.640]   You know, so, so these are all, and we've been doing the versions that we've been doing
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:52.960]   internally was we just use the motion capture system in a, and the, the gear and we just
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.600]   put trackers on it and then we could just wander around.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:59.640]   And when you start wandering around in a 30 by 30 or 50 by 50 space, it really is interesting.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:04.000]   You know, VR becomes an entirely different thing than, than the little square that we've
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.640]   been, that most people are living inside of.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:11.200]   Now ours was just some basic stuff with inside of unity and that we built that just reacts
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:14.120]   to it and so on and so forth as we kind of went down that path.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:20.080]   But, but the where we're going when it comes to gaming, when it comes to school, when it
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:27.280]   comes to vocational training, you know, all kind, there's all, you know, preparation for
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:31.240]   everything from, you know, firefighters to military to police.
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:34.760]   All of those things are going to be transformed by the ability to kind of wander around in
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.800]   larger spaces with these, with these headsets.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:40.960]   So we're, you know, when we saw the first Oculus, it was, you know, the first rift, it
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:45.600]   was pretty rough and, you know, everything's slow, but you, you like everything else.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:48.040]   We're starting to see this mature into a real, a real industry.
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:54.280]   Let's, I think we have to, there's a lot more we could talk about including Apple,
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:58.400]   Apple's own employees calling the Apple TV effort.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:46:59.800]   What did the Wall Street Journal say?
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:04.720]   NBC, Light, Apple is apparently having a difficult time.
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:09.160]   They killed the Dr. Dre, semi-biographical tale because it was too violent.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:11.040]   They're having a difficult time.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.440]   And we, we actually talked about this.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:13.840]   I think maybe you and he mentioned this.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.680]   It'd be difficult for Apple with its, you know, desire to stay squeaky, clean to predict,
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:21.280]   create entertainment people want to see.
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:26.600]   Not only, not only that, but their desire for control and really the reason why Netflix
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.840]   and Hulu and these other companies are getting top-door talent is because that's where, if
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:37.160]   you want, if you, if you're with NBC or CBS, you can't even cast somebody who has one line
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:41.040]   without putting them up, putting four people on tape and sending it to headquarters for
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.040]   their approval.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:48.680]   I don't know how well they're going to do by saying, now, when he, when he gets shocked,
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.240]   does he, can he just say, oh darn it?
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:53.960]   Or could you just, it's like, no, he can't.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.680]   He's going to be cursing up a storm.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.080]   I have so many feelings about it.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:01.360]   There's like, I mean, West Wing entertained me for five years without any language or violence
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:02.360]   or anything.
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.520]   So you can make amazing television without it, but I also think it's artificial to impose
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:07.520]   it.
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:09.280]   That's not how you do something.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.440]   It's hard.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.600]   It's hard to, you nailed it, Andy.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:15.640]   It's hard to attract the creatives.
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:17.560]   It's not so much that you can't do it.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.440]   It's just the creatives don't want to get an environment where they're, where they're handcuffed.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:22.440]   And that's why he's being able to do it.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:25.640]   That was famous for, he didn't make a cast.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.640]   A castel rock or something.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:29.080]   Like Disney made a brand that they were, that they were okay with.
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:32.080]   Yeah, they should ask, we'll just do that and then not have any queue and Tim Cook in
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:33.080]   those meetings.
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:37.560]   I just don't know how successful they'll be if they get the reputation as Apple TV network.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.880]   We're like Netflix if we were run by Ned Flanders.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:45.760]   It's just, unless, unless you're, you know, as speaking as a parent, I'm not that against
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:46.760]   it.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:48.920]   You know, like, like I have other places to go if I want to go to see that content and
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:53.120]   knowing that I can have stuff that I'm not worried about my kids, you know, see, I turn
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:56.560]   stuff on and unfortunately I'm, I watch a lot of stuff.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:00.360]   And so I'm very, I have a very thick skin about what I'm watching and I'll forget that
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:04.080]   there's something in it that my kids can't watch nor that I don't want my kids to watch
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:06.480]   it eight, eight and 10 years old or nine and 10 years old.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.880]   So, so I think that, and I do, I thought about this a lot while they were talking about
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:11.880]   it.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.840]   And, you know, I don't, I think Apple could build an edge.
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.560]   I mean, up until the, you know, more recently Disney, Disney's done everything, but they
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:22.200]   built a pretty good base without doing a lot of going, going crazy.
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:26.880]   You know, Pixar's done okay without a lot of gratuitous violence and swearing.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.560]   I mean, they sold a couple, you know, tickets.
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.080]   So I don't think that it's impossible to build a lot of content.
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:38.480]   And Apple has the one Trump card that, that I think everybody else can't do, which is
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.080]   that they can outbid anybody that they want to any day.
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:44.720]   That's by the way, that's the epithet that, according to the Wall Street Journal, some
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.720]   Apple employees are calling it expensive NBC.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:55.000]   You know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the Witherspoon Anniston is being rumored to be
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.160]   $12 million an episode.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.800]   That is a, I mean, in, in that is a huge number.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:04.560]   Like, no matter how you turn that, that's a, that's a massive number.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:07.000]   I mean, so, so for a single episode.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.440]   And so, I mean, in today's day, we, we do see episodes that big and things like Game
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:13.120]   of Thrones are more expensive than that.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.880]   But, but we don't see that many and definitely ones that are drama, you know, like, you
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:23.080]   don't see dramas that are, I think that ER, I think I heard was like the six to nine
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:24.080]   million kind of range.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:27.400]   And a lot of that's, you know, the salaries and everything else to talent.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:32.000]   Um, so, and, and that's, that's also something we haven't even seen start to really, uh,
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.440]   it is starting to rear its ugly head, which is that when you have Netflix and when you
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.840]   have who, you know, these buyouts, there aren't the same residual structures that there were
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:44.120]   with TV with syndication and, and so on and so forth.
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:46.800]   So the unions are now starting to go, uh, you're like, now that the whole thing is
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:49.960]   like it was like a little business and now it's a big business and the unions are starting
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:52.400]   to want to talk about that.
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:57.360]   Like about about who, how their, how their constituents are being represented and, you
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.040]   know what, you know, what, what money they're going to get in the future.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:03.160]   Netflix is like, I'm going to throw you a pile of cash and I don't want to have another
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:04.160]   conversation about it.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:08.080]   And so far, creative control has gotten Netflix a long way and money.
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:11.080]   Um, they're paying, they're out other than Apple.
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:14.240]   I think that they're probably out bidding almost everybody, you know, uh, as far as
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:20.720]   online, um, goes and, um, um, but Apple again has, has some trump cards that they, that
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:21.720]   they can use.
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:25.560]   I don't think that it necessarily is an impossible thing for them to keep it clean.
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:30.560]   Uh, I do think it's the one argument against that whether they eventually.
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:34.160]   Sometimes just want to give up and just buy Disney, you know, which I still think is still
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:35.160]   possible.
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:39.240]   It's just, it's just, it's just a difficult thing to swallow the idea that they've, they
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:43.840]   made this entire movie about Dre and then decided, uh,
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:46.640]   that's like, that's, that's with a lot of products.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:48.600]   It's me because he left the company.
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:49.600]   Uh, yeah.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.400]   I said it was coming in the org Jesus.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:52.400]   How many?
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:56.000]   That's, that's a, that's a terrible precedent for, for, if, what if they spent all that
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.120]   money on the, on the Reese Witherspoon show and then they say, you know what, Reese?
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:02.040]   Nah, we're not going to, we're not going to release it.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:05.960]   There are, there are many movies that that happens to like, like, like, we don't want
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:09.080]   to, I know, but there's, there's a lot of, there's a lot of movies that just get knifed
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:14.080]   and never, never see the light of day or they get pushed to VHS or they get pushed.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.480]   You know, there's a lot of, like there, you'll see stuff in the list of pro actors where
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:18.480]   you go.
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:21.520]   I just want to refer to the new X-Men movie that the new X-Men movie might never come
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.520]   out.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:23.520]   Disney's bought them now.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:29.520]   But, but, but, but again, who's, what makes Apple attractive to this people who are already
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:32.360]   saying we, you're not, you're not our first choice.
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:36.160]   Maybe we want the, we want to be alongside all the great content on Netflix and Hulu
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:40.640]   and all these other, and film struck maybe even, you're going to say the, but you'll
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:44.280]   give us our, you, it's not just about getting the money to go forward.
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:49.480]   It's like, do you give me an assurance that if we suffer through every single meeting,
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:53.320]   you make us suffer through in planning this and shooting this, that you're not just going
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:57.400]   to simply say, are we don't like red?
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:02.720]   And there's a lot of red, like if the sunset is red and she's got red hair, like, yeah,
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:03.720]   we don't, we're not going to do it.
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:08.120]   But that's, I, I, as someone who, I'm sorry, I'm going to work in the film industry.
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.720]   That is what producers do.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:13.000]   I mean, like, I don't, I don't want to be, I'm not trying to fit the film's
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000]   plane to you.
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.960]   No, no, I'm just, I'm just saying like, like that is like the welcome to the world of,
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:21.720]   of movie making where you have these executives telling you, like when they're explaining
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:24.520]   what Apple said, I was like, well, I've, we've seen that before.
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:29.800]   Like, you know, it's, it's not directors that have a lot of leverage can be tell them to
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:31.960]   go, you know, go fly a kite.
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:33.600]   But it's not usual.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:37.160]   I mean, there's a lot of times when things get re-edited, you hear the directors cut is
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:39.400]   basically the, you know, screw you.
[01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:42.440]   This is what it should have been because the producers decided they were going to do something
[01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:45.720]   else and actually see if it's more often the case than not.
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:49.480]   Oh, it's, it's almost always the case because, because we have to remember that the Hollywood
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:51.200]   is not full of creatives.
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:52.440]   They're full of bankers.
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:55.000]   You know, and so the, and so the thing is is that they are trying, you know, they put
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.040]   a lot of money into this and they want their ROI.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:00.120]   And so they're, they're looking at how to the, you know, Hollywood is looking at how
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:02.960]   to maximize their ROI at every moment.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:08.920]   And so Apple is the interesting thing is, is that Apple and the other, you know, are
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:14.320]   not necessarily trying to maximize RMI R ROI, which is a very interesting thing because
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:19.080]   they're thinking about other things like Netflix is trying to serve many, many groups.
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:23.200]   And it's kind of like they need to be able to have be everything to everyone, which is
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.320]   a very complicated problem for them.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:29.320]   And so, and so, but they have the math to do that.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:32.000]   You know, Apple is trying to build its niche.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000]   What is it going to make it different?
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.640]   I mean, the reality is on our, on our Apple TV, then given the timing, most of us that
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:39.560]   have an Apple TV are going to have, we're going to have Netflix.
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:40.960]   We're going to have Amazon Prime.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:41.960]   We're going to have Hulu.
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:44.360]   We're going to have, you know, like we're already going to have all of those things.
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:48.800]   So Apple is going to have to find some, you know, niche to keep, you know, they don't
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:51.440]   need to replace any of those or even compete with those.
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:56.400]   They just need to simply have some reason that we pay a little bit more for Apple music.
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:58.120]   Or maybe it's just included in Apple music.
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:02.160]   And it just makes it stickier and makes us, makes more people sign up for Apple music.
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:07.320]   But maybe it's Apple media and it's still the same price or it's $2 more and they grow
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:09.480]   instead of two and a half times faster than Spotify.
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:10.960]   They grow four times faster than Spotify.
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:14.120]   I mean, that math makes sense for Apple.
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:18.240]   And so, and they can lose money for a long, long time, you know, as they, as they figure
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.240]   this out.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:24.640]   So they're, you know, that, that's the, the, I think that Apple could definitely, I don't
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.440]   think that this is any death.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.840]   No, I think there's a certain number of people.
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.280]   But what happens with creators is creators look at all the models.
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:35.320]   You look at everybody who's buying and you just figure out what shape does this have to
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:40.200]   be in so that it fits into their shelf, you know, and, and because you're trying to sell
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.200]   stuff to them.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:42.440]   And I could definitely see a lot of creators.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:47.400]   I mean, the big names might not want to do that, but I could definitely see a lot of very
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:52.520]   good filmmakers just say, well, we'll just not journal has an anecdotal story about a
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:58.760]   show, Whitney Cummings show based on the Me Too movement produced by the producer of
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:55:59.760]   Empire.
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:05.960]   Apple had initially green lighted and then decided that the issues tackled were too difficult.
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.800]   Whitney Cummings, like here's a problem.
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:08.800]   I know.
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:09.800]   And now she's pitching it to Netflix.
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:14.560]   So there's always like, how did you, how did you sign a thing with Whitney Cummings and
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:16.080]   not think that it was going to be.
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.080]   Edgy.
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:19.320]   This is, this is, I love Whitney Cummings, by the way, I think she's great.
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:21.040]   I'm just like, I love her standups.
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.040]   I love the stuff that you've done.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:25.800]   But you're like, how could, how could they come in and hashtag Me Too.
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:27.280]   I mean, you know, it's going to be.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:30.560]   But I mean, like to Andy's point, the Cobra Kai people said that they went with YouTube
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:32.720]   only because YouTube green lit a season side unseen.
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:34.720]   And they would let them do whatever they wanted.
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:35.720]   I think increasingly that's what you're going to want.
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.200]   Hey, but they all we got to take a break.
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:38.200]   We can't go on forever.
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:41.440]   I need to take a break and get your picks of the week before I do though.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:45.400]   Let me ask your name one question on the series for what you've got these new faces,
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:46.960]   the fire water and vapor faces.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:49.640]   Are those available on other watches or just?
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.640]   Yes.
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:55.440]   So on the Apple Watch series for you can have them full screen or in little round box with
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:57.440]   complications on the older watches.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:58.440]   They can't go full screen.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.680]   They can only have the round version with the complication.
[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:04.400]   So if you look at them, you might say that's a render, but here it is cool hunting.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.000]   The video, these are film.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.520]   I knew Alex would be interested to show the show my screen because it's full screen.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:15.360]   These are the film of the fire, the water and the vapor faces.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:18.320]   They actually used a high speed.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.320]   I think it's a fandom.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:22.320]   I think it probably is a fandom.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:24.120]   To capture these.
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.120]   Wow.
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.120]   I love the attention to detail of Apple.
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:29.920]   I just love that somebody pitched it.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:32.120]   Because you know, this is not something Apple thought of.
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:34.480]   Somebody pitched them on this.
[01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:36.240]   This was like, I got this great idea.
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.200]   We're going to take a whole bunch of things and do the, you know.
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:40.200]   How do we share the videos on the display?
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:42.280]   Perhaps we can use material.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:45.800]   I don't think that literally someone just pitched it to them.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:48.800]   And the reality is when I look at it, I mean, it is really amazing.
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:52.720]   And when I saw it, I was like, oh, that's, you know, they shot it straight up with a,
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:59.040]   but I wonder, you know, knowing where we are with physics sims, you know, I was like,
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.560]   I don't know if they really need to do that physically.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:02.560]   Not on the watch size.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:03.560]   Not on the long run.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:05.040]   But it was fun that they got to.
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:06.560]   Fun to look at it.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:09.920]   Our show today brought to you by, and I mean literally brought to you by Cash Life.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:11.160]   You downloaded this show.
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:13.000]   You downloaded it from Cash Fly.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:21.960]   Our content distribution network, we literally get petabytes of file transfer every month
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:23.320]   off of their CDN.
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:27.080]   And the thing, the best thing you can say about infrastructure is you don't even know
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:28.080]   it exists.
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.080]   It just works.
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:30.920]   It just happens.
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.880]   Remember the last time you have a CDN?
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:37.280]   You were woken up in the middle of the night with a frantic phone call because your CDN
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:38.280]   was out again.
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:42.000]   I haven't had that call in almost 10 years.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.440]   But if you have, you've definitely got to switch to Cash Fly.
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:50.720]   Cash Fly has been building trusted CDN relationships since 2002.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:58.600]   They eliminate outages guaranteeing 100% availability with a bulletproof 100% SLA.
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:00.680]   Helping you reach new markets, controlling costs.
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:02.000]   Oh, and I mean controlling costs.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.160]   We couldn't do this if Cash Fly did not save us so much money.
[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:08.920]   And man, are they great.
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:14.560]   An expert team of smart, easy to talk to, agile techs that can answer all your questions
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:15.680]   the first time.
[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:18.440]   You won't get passed around from department to department.
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:21.680]   Our experience with Cash Fly has been stellar.
[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:22.680]   Stellar.
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:28.320]   If you have to deliver software or content of any kind, if you rely on content getting
[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:32.960]   to your consumers fast, easily transparently, see that Twit logo?
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:37.000]   Well, we're joined by some pretty big names that use Cash Fly.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.520]   By the way, one of the problems we had is impossible to predict how many downloads any
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:43.480]   show is going to get at any given time.
[01:59:43.480 --> 01:59:46.680]   What the ultimate bandwidth consumption per month will be.
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:52.280]   And it's frustrating when companies lock you into a contract that isn't flexible.
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:57.920]   It's not built around your unusual, unique situation, your demand and your traffic patterns.
[01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:01.520]   And then you all of a sudden you're logging in every day to see, oh my God, have I gone
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:04.160]   over the, have I gone over the limit?
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:05.160]   What's my bill going to be?
[02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:06.160]   No.
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:08.360]   Last month your CDN bill gives you a headache.
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:13.960]   Say goodbye to all those logins and all that anxiety or trying to track your CDN usage.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:19.840]   On average, customers have switched to Cash Fly save more than 20%, 20%.
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:25.120]   Join the thousands of others who trust Cash Fly's reliable network.
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.200]   Let Cash Fly give you some sanity back.
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:31.160]   Actually, we have a special site, twit.cashfly.com.
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:35.560]   You can go there and get a complimentary detail analysis of your current CDN bill, your usage
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:39.440]   trends and see if you're leaving 20% or more on the table.
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.840]   Twit.cashfly.com.
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:46.880]   And as we always have for 10 years, we thank Cash Fly for making all of this possible audio
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:47.880]   and video.
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:52.720]   If you're watching it or listening to it, thank you, Cash Fly.
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:53.720]   Time for our picks of the week.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:55.880]   Renee Richie, you haven't been here in about a month.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:57.920]   I think you probably have a few for us.
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:58.920]   Kick things off.
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:02.080]   So I mentioned it earlier, but I really want to highlight it.
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.640]   Matthew, who was part of the workflow team.
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:07.000]   He was originally their marketing and then their documentation person.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.040]   He's the one who built most of the workflows that were in the original gallery.
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.280]   And I think a lot of the ones that are in the current shortcuts gallery.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:18.840]   He left after Apple acquired workflow because I think he saw the writing on the wall and
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:22.480]   he wanted to be out there and talking about it and not inside and working on it.
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:27.100]   So he's a freelancer now and he's put together an amazing series of shortcut guides for Iam
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:28.100]   Worn.
[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:32.840]   I just put the link to his author page because he's got everything from how to start to how
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:33.840]   to continue.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:37.400]   He's also set up his own YouTube channel where he's sharing a lot of shortcut stuff.
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:41.920]   And I know Federico Vitichy is amazing with shortcuts and David Sparks is amazing with
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:43.400]   shortcuts.
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:47.200]   Matthew was just there and involved with it for so long that I think he brings a special
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:52.000]   exuberance to the technology and he really wants to just evangelize it for everybody.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.880]   And he's doing a spectacular job.
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:57.240]   Iam Worn.com.
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:59.240]   Matthew Cassinelli, C-A-S-S-I-N-E-L-L-I.
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:04.960]   And he has a podcast and a video and a YouTube channel so you can listen to all the automation
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.120]   stuff all the time.
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:08.240]   I really want to spend some time delving into this.
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:11.600]   I just feel like there's so much power here and I'm very excited.
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:12.600]   So good.
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:13.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:14.600]   Andy, not go.
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:16.480]   A pick of the week from you, my friend.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:21.360]   This is a link that you might want to hit sooner rather than later.
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:27.360]   Somebody seems to have found a way to get a copy of the demo animation that you'll find
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:32.520]   on the iPhone XS and XS Max in the Apple stores.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:37.520]   And so you can download this and put it on your Pixel phone, let's say, or your older
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:42.840]   phone or even for iPhone XS because it's not, it's just for demo units.
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:46.720]   You don't get it like on the regular phone and it's super, super, super.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:50.480]   So this is what happens when the phone is sitting in the AT&T store and nobody's using
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.480]   it?
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:55.120]   I don't know if it was just a direct capture.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:56.680]   It looks super sweet.
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:58.040]   This doesn't look like a capture.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:00.880]   This looks like somebody got the video.
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:06.920]   It looks like I again, I made sure I right clicked and saved it before last week when
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.480]   I first saw this link.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:09.480]   Awesome.
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:10.480]   Awesome.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:11.480]   I think it was on Reddit, right?
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:12.480]   Yeah.
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:13.480]   Very nice.
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:14.880]   Four days ago was posted.
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:18.840]   And it's still there, at least at the time of recording.
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:19.840]   Exactly.
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:23.080]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.960]   How much should I spend this week?
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:27.960]   It's complicated.
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:38.800]   So this is a kind of a crazy plugin for motion or it's barely a plugin and more like an
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:39.800]   infrastructure.
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:42.080]   It's almost like a whole nother application that sits inside a motion.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:45.600]   So this is from Motion VFX and it's called the M02.
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:48.400]   It's released this week, brand new.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:54.160]   And what it does is it basically builds this really high quality 3D renderer into Apple's
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:55.160]   motion.
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:59.760]   I mean, you have $50 from Motion and then you put this in and you can bring three models
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:01.360]   in, you can animate them.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:08.920]   And what they did is you can bring them into M02 and then they have all of these, you
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:10.760]   buy these piece by piece.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:14.840]   And they may seem, for those of you who are just playing, $39 may seem like a lot for
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:16.040]   one project.
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:18.560]   But if you're doing production and you go, "Oh, I really need that.
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:19.880]   I just want to swap some stuff out."
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.840]   So the idea is that you can buy any one of these and they're really pretty.
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:29.680]   If you roll over and sit there for a second, it'll play like what that is.
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:37.000]   And so what it'll do is that's just that you open that little start there.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000]   So this is just one example, not that part.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.440]   That's just they're open.
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:42.120]   But that's the kind of animation you can do.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.880]   But 3D animation, so let's just say something like this.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:46.320]   But all of those things are editable.
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:48.760]   You can change the model on the top and you can change this.
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:52.160]   And all the other looks and feel, and that's probably not the best example because I don't
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.680]   know why we use that.
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:57.080]   But the idea is that they've pre-built a whole bunch of bits and pieces.
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:00.320]   Now you can, of course, make whatever you want as well.
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:03.840]   So you can throw your own models in, build your own looks.
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:08.280]   But a lot of these things are, especially if you're doing corporate or if you're doing
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:11.960]   a lot of stuff where you don't have the same kind of budgets that a lot of these have,
[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:14.200]   these guys have just a great eye.
[02:05:14.200 --> 02:05:15.200]   So they make all this pretty stuff.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:16.760]   But all the things that you see there are editable.
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:17.840]   You can change the surfaces.
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:20.280]   You can change the top, where it says stylish topography.
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:22.520]   You just throw in new text.
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:26.600]   And so all of this stuff, they make a lot of great templates.
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:31.800]   But this new one is just kind of amazing because it's rendering all of this in 3D.
[02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:38.480]   And if you want something that's going to push your iMac Pro with your extra GPUs, this
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:39.960]   is one of those things.
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:47.600]   So it kind of turns motion into an entirely different level of production capacity.
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:51.560]   So it's not a replacement for something like Cinema 4D, which I've talked about in the
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:52.560]   past.
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:57.880]   It's not going to do all the things that a 3D app does, but it does a lot.
[02:05:57.880 --> 02:05:59.720]   And it's pretty amazing.
[02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:04.040]   So that's a MO2, check it out, it's motion BFX.
[02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:05.040]   Very nice.
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:07.040]   And that's Mac break weekly.
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:08.920]   One quick second.
[02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:14.760]   Just in case people don't go to the Twit site to get the link to that SpiritSaver animation.
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:18.520]   If you just go to the iPhone subreddit, you should be able to see it or just search for
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:20.440]   iPhone demo unit screensaver.
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:21.640]   And that should turn it off.
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:25.160]   And how do you download it?
[02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:28.680]   I used Downie, which was a pic of the week that I did about it.
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:29.680]   You're a go.
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:31.840]   That's my always result for.
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:34.040]   There's a video playing on my screen that I want.
[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:36.520]   Downie will figure out what the URL is and download the content.
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:38.320]   Very nicely done.
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:39.320]   Thank you.
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:43.320]   And then there are, if you read the rest of the comments on that thread, you can see
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:46.960]   the app that you can get legitimately from the store to play that in the background and
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:48.600]   all sorts of stuff.
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.640]   Very handy.
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:52.120]   That is Mac break weekly for this week.
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:57.880]   Thank you, Andy Inaco, WGBH radio, public radio in Boston.
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:02.440]   And of course, his website, I H N A T K O dot com.
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:06.880]   Are you coming up on G B H soon?
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:08.240]   Probably next Friday, I think.
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:11.120]   Actually, I just got an email from my producer to schedule next week's thing.
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:12.120]   So probably Friday.
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:13.120]   Nice.
[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:15.920]   Thank you also to Mr. Renee Richie.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:16.920]   Here's what you do.
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:19.440]   You go to imore.com.
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:22.640]   You click on all the links, then you go to imore.com/vector.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:25.200]   You listen to all the shows.
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:31.680]   And then you ask Renee, what's the best way to keep track of all my Pokemon go?
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:33.600]   And he'll tell you, Pokey Genie.
[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:34.600]   Yes.
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:36.280]   And by the way, I paid for that.
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.880]   So now I know how strong Pokemon are.
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:40.040]   I've been screaming and shutting.
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:42.440]   I just did an article on Miltan, that's secret new.
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:48.400]   You're selling Nintendo Switch Pokemon and they're doing some weird cross promotion.
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:49.400]   That one with the nut?
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:50.400]   The nut?
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:51.400]   The nut?
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:53.400]   Yes, the nut head and the liquid metal body.
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:54.400]   Yeah, wild.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:55.400]   Wild.
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:56.400]   You can get that too.
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:57.400]   imore.com.
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:07:59.840]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:01.120]   We do Mac Break Weekly.
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:04.880]   Normally on Tuesdays, we flip flop with Windows Weekly because of the insignia.
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:07.800]   Oh, I guess I should mention Alex Lindsay.
[02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:08.800]   Thank you.
[02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:09.800]   Yep.
[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:14.040]   Thanks to Carson for putting your picture up on the screen so I wouldn't forget that.
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:15.040]   That's the core.
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:16.040]   com.
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:18.800]   Follow him on the Twitter if you want to know what he's up to.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:20.360]   ALEX, L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:21.360]   Yep.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:25.080]   And as our studio starts to ramp up in DC, that's why I'm here.
[02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:29.520]   We are definitely looking for more people to be part of the staff.
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:33.040]   So if you are interested, just go to pixcor.com/staffing.
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:34.040]   Fill out your stuff.
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:36.160]   We're going to have some open houses and that's how we're going to contact people is through
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:38.160]   the pixcor.com/staffing.
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:43.040]   We'll contact you and have you over for a tour and we'll chat some more.
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:44.840]   Very nice.
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:46.360]   We do Mac Break Weekly.
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:50.360]   Normally Tuesdays, 11am Pacific, 2pm Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.520]   If you want to watch live, you can.
[02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:54.680]   On our website, twit.tv/live.
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:57.440]   You can also join us in studio, just email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:02.040]   If you're going to be in the Northern California area, we'd love to see you up here in Petaluma
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:05.440]   at an hour north of San Francisco.
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:10.520]   But of course, the easiest way, the most popular way is just to download an on-demand copy.
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:15.280]   You can get that from our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:23.800]   Or put it on your Apple Watch with Apple's podcasts or overcast or any one of the casts
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:25.280]   or Stitcher or Slacker.
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:26.760]   You know, subscribe.
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:30.960]   That way you'll have it each and every Tuesday afternoon after the show's over.
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:33.120]   We'll push it out to you through cash flow.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:36.400]   Thanks to all of you for listening and watching and we will see you next time.
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:40.560]   But now I'm sad to say it's time to get back to work because break time is over.
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:41.480]   Bye bye.
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:51.040]   (music)
