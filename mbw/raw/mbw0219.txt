[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.000]   for that Gilda multimedia artist,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.600]   Pixelcore.tv for their podcast, Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.120]   Hello.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.360]   Hello Alex, how are you today?
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.840]   Welcome.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.240]   Feeling a little curmudgeonly.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.600]   Yeah, we're going to get to your complaints in a moment.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.520]   But first let me also introduce Andy Enoco,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.280]   not with us today, but we're so glad.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.120]   Badding forth and playing for Andy Enoco.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.280]   I've got the jersey to prove it.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280]   He's got the jersey to prove it.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.280]   Jazus, now!
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.160]   Hello.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.160]   It's good to be here.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.800]   It was proud to identify with that local team
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.560]   that won that thing.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.400]   They won the thing.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.720]   They won the thing.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.760]   They didn't win it for 50 years and they won the thing.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.320]   Since before you and I were born.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.520]   They didn't just win the thing.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.720]   True. They crushed the thing.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.920]   They did.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.120]   Yeah, a local team.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.760]   Yeah, a local team that's closer than the team that they beat.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   Woo hoo.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.200]   Yay.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.360]   Yay.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.240]   We're being very proud.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.040]   I feel free to root for the Giants
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.200]   because the Pirates will never be in the World Series again.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.360]   That's your normal local team.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.440]   See, I'm a Red Sox fan going way back.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.200]   In Pittsburgh, we're just happy to sit at a really nice park
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.760]   and watch other teams come through.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.840]   I tweeted Disc-OPO in his tweet, which was,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.440]   "Hara, the sports franchise located close to my physical location
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.280]   emerged victorious against one further away from me."
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.920]   That's pretty much what it is, isn't it?
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.240]   Is it like we won the game or anything?
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.680]   No, I thought people congratulate me.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.200]   I mean, they know I'm a lifelong Giants fan.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   I've been a Giants fan since I was like a first grader.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.480]   So it's a huge deal.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.320]   It's like one of the two sports things that I ever wanted to see in my lifetime.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.720]   But at the same time, it's like, well, congratulations to me
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.960]   for sitting on my couch and watching professional players win a game.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.680]   Yeah, but you know, my butt did well.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.920]   If you follow a team for a long time,
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.560]   I'm a Giants fan since we moved to California.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.320]   So since 1971.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.920]   And I was at the 1989 World Series when the earthquake happened.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.400]   And then we got swept by the Oakland A's.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000]   I sad to say I brought my eight-year-old son to the Angels World Series.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.640]   He saw Barry Bonds hit a home run, and then he saw the Giants collapse.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.800]   That was painful.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.120]   A lot of other than the bridge now, Leo.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.320]   Our torture is over.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.840]   That's right.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.400]   And you know what?
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.480]   I don't care if we win again another 50 years, but once in your lifetime.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's like the Red Sox winning a '04.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.880]   It's one of those things that you can say you actually saw it.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.000]   You know, I was actually pretty excited about the Red Sox winning a '04 for the same reason.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.400]   It was just, you know, now if the cubbies win, we'll all be happy.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.080]   Never going to happen.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.960]   Sorry, Chicago.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.000]   We are here today though, we are gathered together to talk about the Apple news.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.760]   And you know, one of the things we were talking about right before we start was your frustration.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.360]   We use Google Docs for our show notes to share our...
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.000]   And so do we.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.680]   So I just want to say we use them as well.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.480]   And we recently moved the company over to Google Apps.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.280]   And so did we.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.040]   But you're not so happy.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.640]   And Macworld is well.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.040]   Did I, I forgot to say, Jason's now editor in Chief Macworld Magazine.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.440]   Present.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.000]   I didn't really give you your full title.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.560]   Thank you, Lee.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.080]   Was that a painful move to move over to Google Apps for you, Macworld?
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.200]   You know, honestly, a lot of us had been using it on the slide without the official approval of our IT
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.440]   department, because we do a lot of collaboration.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.200]   You know, Google Docs, the nice thing about the word processor is we used to have to pass
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.160]   around like word files.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.800]   And now news breaks and we want to write a story really fast.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.200]   You can have like six different people writing it simultaneously using Google Docs.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.360]   And then in an hour or two, you've got a complete story.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.880]   It would never happen that way before.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.440]   So that's great.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.920]   That's a great argument for that.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.400]   That's been great.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.760]   Did you ever use Wave for that?
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.440]   Oh, no.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.040]   We tried, couldn't figure it out.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.320]   Didn't really make a lot of sense.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.960]   Same thing.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.760]   But, but the same thing happened here.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.160]   And I guess I gather the same thing happened at Pixel Core, which is
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.800]   individual users started using Google Docs.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.160]   We use Google Docs all the time.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.960]   So we said we might as well have a corporate kind of make it corporate.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.640]   And so that's, I mean, that's exactly what it was.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.360]   Take three days.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.400]   It turned out to be a huge mistake.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   I mean, I don't know what the deal, I mean, it's the way, however they handle the login.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.160]   So we all had our individual G-Man.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.480]   That's the problem.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.800]   And we got to a position where basically everything started with me opening up
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.280]   Dragon software in Google Docs.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.800]   And I would sit there and dictate out, you know, things that needed to be started off,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.000]   or the guys would all work on it.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.720]   And it was easy.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.560]   People would pass them things around.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.360]   Everything would work as soon as we, you know, went corporate and paid for the,
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.440]   the service. It has immediately broken.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.000]   Like I literally just don't know how I'm supposed to get in.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.040]   There's no easy way to get in.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.280]   And I can't even imagine, if I'm having trouble with this,
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.520]   I can't even imagine what a corporate user is going to think when they can't,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.640]   and I'm telling them I can't log into it.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   I'll tell you why I bring this up because you said,
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.640]   "Gee, if Apple did this, it would work."
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.120]   And I'll say the doc hack has not been a success,
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.160]   but I think that that, I think that they're in the process of revamping that.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.280]   And so that's the interesting question is, you know,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.680]   Microsoft has announced a cloud strategy.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.000]   You can get office in the cloud.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Where's Apple in all this?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.440]   Do you think Apple might want to do this?
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.720]   I think that they have to.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.360]   Is this why they're building the North Carolina?
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.240]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.960]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.800]   I think that they, you can't ignore the fact that you want to do this kind of stuff
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.920]   for exactly the reason that Jason was talking about.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.000]   You want to be able to do this this morning when we were working on TWIM,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.240]   when we record TWIM before this, this weekend media.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.680]   And this weekend media.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.160]   I'm literally putting up the news stories from this morning,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.120]   and Suzanne is filling them all out for the hosts while I'm working.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.080]   And in 15 minutes, we went from all the news stories to all being done.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.240]   Right.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.680]   You know, and that's the kind of stuff that we use.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.040]   We use Google Docs for that.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.360]   Yeah, and it's just, and once you get used to producing documents on the cloud,
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.600]   it just seems insane that you're going to pass documents around.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.080]   You know, and, you know, I, we're dealing with a company in Germany doing all this
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.840]   contract negotiation back and forth.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   And the fact that I have to send these, you know, word docs back and forth,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.840]   just seem insane because it's just like this,
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.120]   oh my gosh, I sent the wrong version and now they're upset because it was the last version
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.080]   instead of the newest version.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.200]   And they thought that I ignored them.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.880]   And, you know, there's all this stuff that, that is, you know, that comes up just because
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.640]   we're not collaborating on something.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.120]   So the idea of cloud is the future.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.640]   We're still in that kind of rocky area.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.240]   And I just, this just has been the last couple of weeks since we, you know,
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.280]   the last month and a half since we switched over has just been mind-numbingly frustrating.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.800]   What's your experience, Jason?
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.600]   You know, I think Apple, Apple's got to do something here.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.720]   You're absolutely right.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.960]   If you look at the setup experience on Android where you put in your Google ID and in theory,
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.640]   you know, everything sort of sinks.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.120]   And yet Apple, although they have mobile me, it's a $99 a year charge.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.640]   So they can't assume that everybody who buys their products has it.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.560]   And even if they create some sort of, you know, free model and then you pay for more like drop box,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.200]   if they did that, they could integrate it into all of their products.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.680]   And assume that there was a base level of online functionality on all their devices.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.880]   You know, you put in your iTunes ID and it automatically sinks your contacts and your bookmarks
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.120]   and all sorts of other things instead of having you, you know, upselling you to mobile me.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.840]   So I think that, I think they have to do it to remain competitive.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.920]   The question is, you know, when will they do it and how will they execute?
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.360]   Because some of the more recent updates to mobile me have not been bad.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.000]   Like the, the, the mobile me calendar is actually not just-
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.520]   It just got updated, didn't it?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.960]   Yeah, yeah, they've got a beta, but it's a lot better.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.440]   I love it.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.400]   Some of their other stuff.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.920]   But I'm not going to use it in lieu of Google.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.840]   No, no, and I use both too.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   I mean, I basically am paying $99 mostly for my iPhone.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.920]   For my iPhone, that's really cool.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.400]   And look what I think.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.880]   So they've got to do it.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.400]   It's just a matter of the details and they've got to do a good job, right?
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.960]   I mean, iDISK is terrible and I use drop box because it's so much better than iDISK.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.720]   And they've got to get this stuff right.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.680]   They can't just do it.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.480]   They've got to do it right.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.800]   Apple, Apple has kind of seeded it to everybody else.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.480]   Here's, you, you, you can go through the features of mobile me one by one and somebody's doing it better.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.040]   Gmail's doing it better than may Apple mail and calendar and contacts.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.520]   Um, you, you, you, and you feel like they have it all sitting right in front of the drop box.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.760]   People that are willing to be tied into their devices.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.960]   They're willing to be tied into this thing.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.720]   They want to have, you know, I want to have everything work ubiquitously across my iPhone,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.520]   my iPad, my different computers and so on and so forth.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.600]   So you have people who are, who are ready to do it and it just hasn't been, um,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.720]   completely tied up and obviously no one figured out.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.320]   In a way they've already lost though because for instance, this, this calendar update,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.680]   uh, uh, it's pretty cool and I applied it immediately and updated my iCal and made sure
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.200]   that everything worked with that.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.560]   But I was already tied in to, uh, Google calendars.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.560]   So there, there's not, there's no incentive really for me to, uh, to shift over, right?
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.880]   Well, they're, they're, I mean, to their credit, they do make sure that their stuff works with Google
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.800]   and that's, that's, that's good.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.280]   Right.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.440]   But there are also lots of Apple customers out there who don't get Google and aren't doing
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.240]   stuff with Google.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.480]   And if they can reach those people, then, you know, they still got, there's still a lot of
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.160]   opportunity out there for people who just are never going to do this sort of thing,
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.520]   but they'll put in their iTunes ID.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.800]   In fact, they don't even need to put it in.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.720]   It'll just go there when they sync with the iTunes on their, on their computer.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.360]   And then it says, would you like me to sync all your bookmarks and contacts and calendars?
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.760]   And, and if you can assume that everybody's got some version of mobile me and you can step
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.000]   people through, maybe keyed off of their iTunes account, they could really improve the customer
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.880]   experience a lot.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.640]   And isn't, I mean, that's what Apple's about, right?
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.600]   It's supposed to be easy.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.960]   And right now it's kind of a mess.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.360]   Right.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.280]   Well, and I think that the thing is, is that there's a whole new, uh, audience that's entering
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.440]   the Apple sphere when you look at the iPads and the, you know, that, I think the iPad specifically,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.960]   uh, is that, you know, that's a lot of, and there's a lot of people there that don't
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.920]   really interact with my, you know, my parents don't know anything about, uh, Google,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.000]   other than how to search, you know, search things, but they don't know anything about any
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.920]   of the other services that Google provides other than the website and, uh, and not even the maps.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.120]   I don't even think they use Google maps.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.640]   And so the, um, so anyway, so that the thing is, is that I think that there's still a map.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.760]   We think of the market as saturated, but we are still way on the front edge of that process.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:29.040]   And, um, and there is still 90% of the general population that, that is still accessible.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.160]   My wife calls that feature, find my husband.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:32.640]   You know what?
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.360]   Don't tell anybody, but that's how we track our kids.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.960]   We're talking about the find my iPhone feature.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.480]   I'm showing, I'm showing this right now.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.360]   And you can see where my iPhone is, where my iPad is.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.880]   I could see that my wife is shopping.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.160]   I can see the Henry's in school.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.320]   And I could see that Abby's in school.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.080]   So all, all in all, this is, this is, it's kind of like very Harry Potter, isn't it?
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.280]   You know what's funny is I, I, I realized, so I, that's, I think that's almost worth 99 bucks a year.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:57.840]   I have to say.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.680]   Well, that's what makes it worth it for me.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.040]   I misplaced my car, um, over the weekend.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.000]   It was a little interesting.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.200]   Yeah, that's like a tragic story.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.280]   I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.440]   It was, it turned out that it was right where I left it.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.440]   And, and it took the petalume police to find it.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.120]   So anyway, um, so the, uh, but I realized that after that, of course,
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.560]   I started searching for GPS units.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.840]   And I realized that the cheapest GPS unit that you can put in your car is to find a place to
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.000]   install an iPod touch.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.880]   Because it's got the GPS and you usually find my iPhone.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.880]   Instead of paying for a service.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.560]   Oh, you could have done that with your car.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.520]   If you'd left an iPod touch.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.920]   Well, my, at first my wife thought she had forgot her, uh,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.960]   forgot her, um, at first she thought she had forgot her phone in the car.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.920]   And then she was worried about whether they would, you know, open up the phone.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.040]   But it was, it was dead.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.880]   But the point is, is that, is that I realized, you know, if you plugged it in, you know, um,
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.680]   if you had a speed charge, you'd always know where your car was.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.000]   Wow.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.640]   Um, you know, uh, you know, it would be actually a lot cheaper than paying $39 or $49 a month
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.680]   for a LoJack service.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.960]   You know, that, I mean, it's pretty fun.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.440]   It's pretty fun.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.000]   But, um, but it was, uh, it's actually a much cheaper solution, uh, than, uh, with the,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.960]   the fine my iPhone.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.280]   Very cool.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.040]   As long as I can see a wifi network.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.840]   Otherwise.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.440]   No, no, no, the, the iPod touch has a, the new one doesn't, doesn't the, the new iPod
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.800]   touch have a GPS in it?
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.480]   I'm not sure if it does.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.680]   And if it does, it still has to be on the internet in order to tell you where it is.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.000]   Right.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.400]   Well, then the old, so you have to get an extra iPhone.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.840]   Just put it just an extra iPhone.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.320]   Just stick it in.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.800]   Like an iPad.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.920]   I don't know if it needs that iPad.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.800]   I don't know.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.080]   Leave your iPad in the car.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.880]   That's what you should do.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.280]   Free G.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.600]   iPad.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.960]   And just tape it to the dashboard.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.200]   It'll never get stolen.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.560]   I have to say I, I, I still have the iPad, but I've been using the MacBook Air an awful lot.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.800]   How do you guys at Mac world like the air?
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.280]   Oh man.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:35.600]   Yes.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.160]   I've got that.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.880]   I've got that right here.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.520]   The 11 inch.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.400]   This is the 11.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.920]   I think that's the one, isn't it?
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.240]   This is the ultimate actually.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.080]   This is the, uh, the one point.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.480]   What is it?
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.120]   1.4
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.760]   1.6.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.120]   Do you feel it was necessary to upgrade?
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:53.200]   I'll tell you, I mean, I tried the base model and now I'm trying the ultimate because we've got like four or five of them here.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.480]   We had to test all the configs.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.800]   Love the 11 inch though.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:02.880]   I'm not sure for most people, you know, if money's no object, the ultimate's great because it's a little faster and it's got a little faster.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.120]   But I find the basic is fast enough.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.880]   999.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.200]   Great price, especially if this is a second system.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.080]   This is your laptop.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.520]   You've got a desktop and you just want to.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.640]   By the way, only an Apple user would say 999.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.280]   Great price.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.880]   Well, you know, in Mac OS 10, I mean, among laptops that run Mac OS 10.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.840]   It's a great price.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.040]   It's a great price, right?
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.360]   And if you want to pay less, then, you know, I always have this argument with the guys across the hall of PC world.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.960]   They're like, well, you can get something much cheaper.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.920]   It's like, yeah, but it's not a Mac.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.880]   It doesn't run OS 10.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.000]   I could get that.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.440]   I would really rather not.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.600]   And I think most Mac users are like that.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.280]   Plus, you know, the build quality is really good.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.960]   It's a, it's a solid system.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.760]   It ain't a net book.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.080]   It's a net book size, but it ain't a net book.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.720]   You know, it's got a full size keyboard is huge for me.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.680]   I mean, I test drove.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.520]   I've got a net book down here under my desk that I test drove for a while running OS 10.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.720]   In fact, I hacked it on there.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.000]   And the compromises you have to go through with a keyboard.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.880]   And the fact that this, I mean, even the 11 inch MacBook Air is the exact same keyboard that's on all the other Mac books,
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.080]   even up to the 17 inch.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.240]   It's on the Apple USB and Bluetooth keyboards.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.440]   It is Apple's keyboard.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:05.920]   It is.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.200]   It's got the same feel.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.400]   It's got the same shape.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.880]   Your fingers aren't going to mistype because this is, you know, 8% smaller.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.600]   Keep caps.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.520]   It's exactly the same.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.320]   And the screen is pretty good too, because it's that high res screen.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.200]   So you don't even feel like you're sacrificing a lot of screen resolution,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   even though it's physically smaller, because there's still actually a lot of pixels on there,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   as much as the old 13 inch MacBook Air.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.680]   Right.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.080]   I have to say, my wife has an older MacBook and I have to say I was typing on it yesterday.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.200]   And I realized how much I liked that keyboard way better than the chicklets.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.920]   Like the old, the older laptop.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.880]   This is all the new ones, including the Air have this chicklets.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.960]   The square key caps.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.280]   Square key caps and a unified.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.920]   And the thing is, is the old one with the older keys, I felt like I was typing much faster.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.600]   And it was much more comfortable.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.720]   And I was like, oh, I haven't touched a keyboard like this keyboard for a long time.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.360]   Yeah, I forgot.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.240]   I've forgotten about it.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.840]   Yeah, I just don't really remember what it was like.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.120]   Yeah, I like the keyboard.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.880]   I think it's, I think it's pretty good.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.480]   I can type really fast on it.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.080]   And anybody who's comfortable with that keyboard, you know, that's the nice thing.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.720]   The new keyboard.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.120]   You liked it.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.760]   They're new.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.200]   Yeah, I do like the new square keyboard.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.160]   Yeah, I like it too.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.040]   It doesn't matter me that much.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.000]   I mean, most of my heavy typing is all done with my microphone.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.080]   So I don't really, I don't have to type very long.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.640]   Fair enough.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.080]   It's your iPad?
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.840]   No, with my, with my iPad with my, just with a dictator.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.040]   You dictate or you just don't do any type.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.600]   No, no, I dictate.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.120]   I saw anything longer than about.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.760]   I just don't write.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.800]   I just talk.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.600]   I talked for a living.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.320]   I realized a long time ago, I can talk a 10,000 words.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.120]   No problem.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.880]   Writing 10,000 words is like killing me.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.920]   It's like killing me now.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.040]   Yeah, we have to make documents.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.520]   And so when we do documents, though, usually I just set, put the microphone up,
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.640]   and I just dictate the whole thing, and then I pass it on to somebody else who I like.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.680]   They've actually gotten really good at, you know, the, what the dictation software,
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.360]   you know, Dragon does with my words, and they've gotten good at knowing what I actually meant.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.440]   We are, we're talking about Max is what we're doing.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.640]   Boy, I haven't done that in a while.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.760]   We were talking about iPads and iPhones all the time now.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.800]   We're actually talking about Max.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.520]   I think that's pretty cool.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.080]   How about that?
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.120]   Isn't that nice?
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.760]   Yeah, it is.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.440]   We get all these emails from people who are saying,
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.040]   "Hey, you're Mac, what are you talking about?"
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.200]   Mac, what?
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.560]   The iPad, the iPod, and all that.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.240]   And it's like, well, let's let, can Apple do something with the Mac, please?
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.360]   And here we are.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.160]   I was, I wish we did a newsletter last week, and it was like, oh my God,
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.600]   it's all Mac stuff in a newsletter.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.040]   Oh, how can that be?
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.520]   It's great.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.440]   Yeah, it really is.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.480]   It's kind of a nice feeling.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.040]   And now, Jason, you haven't been around for a few weeks,
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.240]   so I just wanted to run by you the idea of the App Store.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.280]   As, you know, I have to say, I've calmed down a little bit.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.160]   But at first, I was really concerned that this might be a trend away from an open Mac platform.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.560]   Well, my attitude now is, well, we'll wait and see.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.440]   But it's certainly clear, a lot of developers and a lot of users are really excited about the
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.320]   idea of an App Store.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.920]   What's your take on the App Store that'll be part of Lion?
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.440]   It goes back to something.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.840]   It'll actually even be before Lion, I guess, in a really January.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.640]   Yes, a couple months, yeah.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.080]   We'll get it on Snow Leopard.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.320]   You know, something we said before about the Google users and then the regular people.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   I think there are a lot of regular Mac users out there,
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.480]   and they're more all the time, Apple selling more Macs than they ever have before.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.160]   They've kept having record Mac sales, and they say that half the people who buy a Mac
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.240]   in their retail store are new to the Mac entirely, which is kind of amazing.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.680]   Say one half?
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:17.360]   Half of the retail sales of Macs in the Apple's retail stores are the people who have never
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.080]   bought a Mac before.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:18.400]   That's really good.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.080]   And it's been that way for the last two years.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.160]   Keep waiting for them to not say that.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.320]   Right.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.840]   Some quarter, and they just keep saying it.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:30.320]   So for those people, a lot of those people are not trained to go look at sites and find
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.560]   software and download it and buy it, shareware, kind of the traditional stuff.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.000]   They're not that savvy, right?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.320]   But now Apple's trained them to look for this App Store model for the iOS.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:46.880]   So it really opens up a whole new market to the Mac software developers who may be making a living,
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.080]   a good living with the savvier people who are able to go find that stuff.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.040]   But what about that other market that would never think about finding Mac software,
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.680]   but the idea of a Mac App Store might actually work for them.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.200]   So there's a lot of potential there.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.560]   I mean, there are a lot of pitfalls.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.120]   There are a lot of rules that are in the agreement.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.080]   So it's a question about what's going to get approved and not.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.560]   But as long as there's this other approach, so you can not get approved and still actually
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.600]   release your app.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.680]   And then it becomes more about trying, it's like trying to get your software or your book
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.240]   or whatever into the Apple retail store.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.160]   If you don't get it in there, you can still sell it.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.280]   It's not like the App Store.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.760]   It'll be, I think it'll be big with some caveats.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.440]   I think it'll be big because it'll reach a new audience.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.040]   Can I make my bold predictions?
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   Yes, bold prediction time.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.520]   So we'll see the App Store really roll out in 2011 at WWDC.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.840]   Within two years, my prediction is you'll need to boot into OS 10 without it.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.320]   So within, by 2013, you'll boot, you'll have it like what you boot into boot camp.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.920]   You'll boot into the old OS 10, but you'll have a whole entire environment.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.560]   So the Fire environment.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.160]   It'll like be the blue box.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.200]   It'll be within, by 2013 is my prediction.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.120]   So 2011, we'll see it just start to roll out.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.640]   By 2013, you'll boot into it.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.240]   And by 2015, it'll be gone.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.320]   You know, and that's kind of what I was thinking.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.800]   And that's what I was railing against because I thought, well, this is a move away
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:13.600]   from an open platform, but it is appropriate for Apple to look at how people use computers
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.840]   and make computers that are for the rest of us.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.040]   That's what they've always done, right?
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.640]   When we start it, go ahead, Jason.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.000]   I'm not entirely convinced.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.200]   I mean, Jobs is famous for saying at the De-conference this year that PCs are like trucks and they're
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.160]   going to end up as sort of special purpose devices.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.600]   I'm not sure that the vision of kind of putting OS 10 in this kind of you boot over here
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.880]   approach is going to work for that because there are a lot of pro uses for computers
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.840]   and there will continue to be.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.440]   So let me spin that slightly differently as I think it's going to be a little like
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.400]   parental controls.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.560]   I think that you're going to get max that are turned with the app store sort of turned on.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.520]   It's like simple fighter.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.920]   Yeah, that's the basic use.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:00.560]   And for who knows what that percentage is 70, 80, 90, 50, who knows, percent, they'll never even
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.040]   think to flip on the thing that gives them unfettered access, which is what we think of today.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.040]   But I think that that's a process, right?
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.680]   First, they'll say a parental control that it was only app store apps.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.960]   And then the next one, it'll be maybe they'll boot by default into that.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.920]   You know, so I do think that there's some truth in that that Apple wants to make this a
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.880]   simpler process for sort of the regular people who are out there.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.400]   But if Apple's vision about the iPad and devices like that is the future,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   eventually those people are not going to be as big a component in the computer market,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.920]   they're going to be it's going to be truck drivers and they're going to want to drive it
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.640]   the way they want to drive it.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.440]   They'll be truckers will all be, you know, a few of us will stay truckers.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.160]   Yes, I know equipment was like that for a long time.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.240]   You know, people would talk about all the speeds and feeds and it wasn't so much about the music.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.760]   And now it's so much not about how you play it.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.040]   It's all about content.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.480]   And I suppose that's what it's because MP3 is from a sound quality or so bad.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.600]   Why bother investing in it?
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.320]   But if you're an audio file, you're you're booming this.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.160]   You're saying exactly what you just said, which is, oh my God, I mean, the quality is terrible.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.520]   How can people listen to this?
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.080]   Do people even buy stereos anymore?
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.600]   You know, that's a minority because Apple primarily made it so easy just to go point click,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.240]   put it on a thing and listen whether the quality is good or not is is secondary.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.200]   And I think that the issue is that we're using the general population.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.280]   We in the tech community use our computers much differently than the general population.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.040]   I just always look at who who's using it around me at when I visit home, you know,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.120]   and and the thing is in how they're using it and what they're using and everything they're doing
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.400]   could fit inside of the iOS.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.680]   And the thing is, is they're not going to change for most of their lifetime.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.760]   And what's going to happen is the applications that are in the iOS are getting bigger and more
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.480]   powerful where they're going to do a lot of those things anyway.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.240]   I mean, I think that the so I mean, I think that that's the issues that we're using those
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:40.800]   computers differently.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   When I started using computers, most of if I wanted to have a graphics application,
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.440]   I wrote it.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.120]   You know, you know, and so it was like I wrote it from scratch because that was the only way
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.360]   I could get graphics applications out of my Apple 2E.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.960]   You know, and and so the thing is is that we're moving to a position where I think that the
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.400]   that not for us, but for the general population, the computer is an appliance, you know, and it
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.080]   has lots of things that we wanted to do.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:10.560]   But it's no longer this this thing that we, you know, we we may create things in it,
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.800]   but it's not in the same way that we that all of us who are on the show grew up doing.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:20.080]   No, but I mean, it's not I finally had to recognize that that's, you know, old school and maybe it
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.360]   isn't there isn't a future for I mean, if you want to run Linux, you can run Linux.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.680]   If you I mean, Windows is probably not going to change a whole lot.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.640]   Although I imagine Microsoft looks closely at what Apple does and says,
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.280]   Hmm.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:29.840]   And I just don't know.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.000]   I mean, for me, the question is, is is this happening in the iOS?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.960]   Is it happening in the Mac?
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.240]   I mean, there are a lot of people who want to say the Mac is going to end up evolving into
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.320]   something that's very much like the iOS.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:47.200]   Maybe Apple will keep the Mac around as that it could evolve as that all-purpose device,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.640]   or it could evolve as that truck.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:55.440]   And that's what I'm not sure about is that we may see the Mac meaning more and more professional
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.720]   kind of use over time because does Apple really want the Mac to be the thing that evolves into
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.160]   this this new way to consume or is that the iOS?
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.200]   I think it's the iOS.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.760]   Now, maybe they collide, maybe somewhere down the road, there's a system that runs iOS or runs
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.680]   Mac OS, like Alex is saying sort of, you know, boot into the Mac part.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.880]   And quite honestly, if I could get an iPad that had a little had one of those little keyboards on
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.560]   it, so it was like an iPad laptop or I could clip a keyboard onto it because I'm a writer,
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.800]   I do need a keyboard a lot of the time.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.000]   I would be into that.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.040]   So well, I use my Bluetooth keyboard all the time with my iPad.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.520]   I have I have one stand at the iPad and I use it.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.680]   Yeah, but that's not in your lap, right?
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.640]   If I'm on a plane or in the bus or something like that or even in bed, you know, the iPad
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.040]   and the remote keyboard doesn't it won't work, you know, you need it sort of together.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.680]   I will say I've started building little things that I've now started using on the plane where
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.600]   I can attach my iPad to the seat in front of me.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.120]   Each one is different.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.240]   You need some need Velcro, some need suction cups, some need.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.680]   And I've been kind of I have this little collection of things that I've started putting
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.720]   together where I can attach it.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:04.400]   I'll tell you a Bluetooth keyboard on your on your on your little tray with the iPad hanging
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.440]   from the seat in front of you, especially in economy makes actually economy a little bit
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:07.920]   more doable.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.760]   We just have to recognize that Alex Lindsey is not like you and me.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.320]   He's just a strange way.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.880]   He has strange ways and anybody who would base their use case on what Alex does
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.320]   would be going down a very strange road.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.080]   You bring a box of crap with Velcro and stuff.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.080]   Just to get the TSA's got all of that.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.680]   It gives me something to do.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:36.320]   I was on the tarmac for two hours in Phoenix and it gives me something I sit around fiddling with it
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.760]   and it gives me something to do.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.080]   Okay.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.560]   I'm easily bored.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.080]   I'm painfully ADD.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.320]   For the rest of us.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.600]   I mean, it really is true that there is has to be a development platform.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.280]   So why couldn't you have that development?
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.400]   I mean, I spent all of this week.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.200]   Well, I mean, that's a Mac, right?
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.800]   That's the development platform, isn't it?
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.800]   So you need a desktop of some kind to write software with.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:02.720]   So far, but do you eventually need that if you've got an iPad and a keyboard and a development
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:02.960]   environment?
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.760]   Come on, no developer is going to work
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.680]   write software on an iPad.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.400]   You could do that.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.440]   Yeah, you could do that.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.720]   Not today.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.960]   Not today, but what about a computer that's running iOS could easily power
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.960]   a text code. You think that the day is going to come when a developer, a video editor, a photographer
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.640]   doesn't want the biggest screen.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.320]   They can get a 30 inch screen doesn't want the most horsepower they can get as a quad or six way
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.880]   Xeon. I mean, but that day is not going to go away.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.600]   I don't disagree.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.440]   Creators are going to want that high end stuff.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.560]   No, I don't disagree, but I don't understand why Aputure couldn't run an iOS.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.240]   No, of course it can.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.200]   On a 30 inch monitor.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.040]   Of course it can, but it's not desirable.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.080]   Really for a photographer who doesn't really know anything about.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.880]   Who's not for a photographer who doesn't know anything about what they want to do other than
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.160]   working on their photos and saying a photographer who doesn't want to use Photoshop.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.280]   Yeah, there's a lot of them.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.480]   There are a lot of them.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.000]   I'm not gainsaying that there are a lot of them.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.480]   I'm not gainsaying the vast majority might want something really stupid and simple,
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.920]   but Apple has to support at least developers or nobody's going to write software for this crap.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.520]   No, I'm sure they will.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.120]   It's just a question of what that fragment of the market is that demands that stuff.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.640]   Because I'm sure you'll be able to edit, you can edit video now on an iPhone.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.640]   I realize it's primitive, but it's there now on that hardware.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.320]   And so if you look out a few years, you'll be able to do a lot with the iOS.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.160]   I think there's still going to be that percentage.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.280]   And I don't know if it's 10% or 20 or 30 that will want that extra that Leo's talking about.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.360]   Yeah, and there's a risk to that.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.800]   You got to support that or abandon it.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.560]   And I don't think Apple will do that, but they might.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.040]   It's possible.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.360]   But this is the risk inherent in treating your users as consumers
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:48.400]   as opposed to creators is that you could actually read the creators out of your user base.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.000]   And by doing so, kill it.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.560]   Well, I guess one of the things that I look at is when I was at ILM,
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.120]   a lot of the artists that first came in to do character animation were all,
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.200]   they were traditional artists.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.000]   I mean, they literally were cell animators.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.920]   That's where you got most of them because they understood motion,
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.560]   they understood weight, squash and stretch, so on and so forth.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.120]   They knew nothing about the Unix infrastructure that they were working on.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.560]   They literally, the application went open and there'd be big balls that they could grab onto
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.600]   and move the character around.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.680]   And there'd be all these things that they would do to animate it.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.560]   And if anything, if they stepped off the rails at all, there was a tech support call and some
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.160]   TD would come over and fix it for them.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.080]   Yeah, but those users don't have a tech support.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.240]   No, but what I'm saying is that when you're talking about those creators,
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.720]   I think that there are a lot of people who want to create.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.680]   And I think that in its early stages, we don't have all those tools yet in the iOS,
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.600]   but I think that we're going to see a lot more and a lot more power.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.040]   And I think that just because it runs only on the iPad and the iPhone right now,
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.160]   it doesn't mean that when it runs on a big machine, it's not going to use all 16 processors
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.080]   and not be able to do all those things.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.640]   And it's going to shield a creative user from the thing that a lot of them hate,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.600]   which is the OS.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:55.920]   I just--
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:02.080]   I don't think that Apple is trying to make this dichotomy between people who create.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.040]   And if you look at what's already happened in the early days of the iOS,
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.440]   you've got people forcing their way into how many text editors are there on the iPad now,
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.040]   how many paint programs.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.400]   I think there's a 3D program.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.080]   I mean, there's lots of stuff out there already.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:18.400]   So I think creative people are going to force their way in to a platform anyway.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.040]   But some of the traffic--
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.760]   Is it an ideal?
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.240]   --is it an ideal?
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.360]   The traffic might go away.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.240]   Yeah, is it an ideal?
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.800]   I mean, really, don't you still want a 30-inch screen?
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.360]   I mean, really?
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.640]   But the question is, why wouldn't you have a 30-inch screen with iOS?
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.680]   It would just be iOS on a 30-inch screen.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.400]   Eventually, yeah.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.120]   Eventually.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.440]   So you guys just made the case for me that we're going to iOS.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.760]   I think it's inevitable.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.840]   Well, I mean, it's the modern--
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.720]   I mean, I just--
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.320]   I've been the one who has been saying it.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.040]   So I'm just glad--
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.400]   I didn't have to say that anywhere.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.600]   Well, I'll play.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.000]   My whole thing is--
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.200]   It's going to take a while.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.000]   It's going to take a while.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   It's going to take a while.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.480]   It's going to take a while.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   I don't think it's going to be five years.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.200]   I don't think it's going to be anything.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.080]   And I just would like to--
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.440]   And it won't be what it is today, right?
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.320]   And people freak out now.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.400]   And it's like, oh, and five years, Apple will just have iPads.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:06.400]   And that's all it is.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.280]   It's like, no, because you still will need to develop an edit video.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.240]   It'll have some data.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.760]   Maybe they'll call it Mac OS.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.560]   Maybe it'll be a Mac extension.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.360]   There's just a--
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.400]   It's just an iOS.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.760]   And I guess to me, I feel like it's the dumbing down of the platform.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.000]   And there's a risk when you dumb the platform down that you also push out--
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   The people that you need to keep it vital.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.600]   And this is where my argument came that Apple should license or open source the iOS.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.160]   And then that's a real problem, too, because then you have a fork--
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.440]   You have a fork development tree.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.160]   Well, I'll tell you what it is.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   It's a scorched earth policy.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.800]   If you push the entire industry towards iOS and then you open source OS 10 so that it
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.800]   runs on everything else, how do you have a room for Linux and Windows and everything else when
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:53.360]   you could get a free copy of OS 10, which is a very well developed GUI platform, or iOS,
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.560]   which is going to be free.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.680]   The thing about iOS is that I don't think we're going to ever see these upgrades.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   And the upgrades from now on, I think, are going to be--
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   I mean, when we move to a full iOS environment, you're going to end up in a situation where,
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   you know, we're no longer paying for OS.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.080]   That's for you.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.560]   That was signed.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.040]   Oh, thank you.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.440]   That was signed.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.240]   That was-- I just spent the-- anyway, I spent the week in--
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.520]   Alex just gave me the Big Nerd Ranch iPhone programming book to prove--
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.040]   To prove that there are still people who wish to program.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.640]   We were programming for the iOS.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.840]   That was what we did all last week.
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.160]   Right.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.840]   And I had such a great time.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.800]   I just feel like we're--
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.680]   On the Mac OS.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.080]   It's in the Mac OS.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.120]   On the Mac OS.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.280]   You're breeding out the intelligence.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.480]   Well, that's the trick, right?
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.280]   If they do it right, Leo, then that won't happen.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.720]   And if they do it wrong, that will happen.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.400]   So the devil's in the details.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.120]   But I think that there's a lot of promise there.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.880]   And I think that Apple will be reluctant to part with the Mac until it really feels like
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.760]   it's got-- everybody has come over.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.000]   And, you know, again, I think Apple will be comfortable with it being a--
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.520]   That truck product, that pro-level product for the tinkerers.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.840]   And I think that's not a bad product strategy for them to say,
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.360]   look, five years down the line, Mac sales are going to be small,
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.960]   but they're going to be at the high end.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.560]   And they're going to be for pro-video people and high end photographers
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.400]   and other software developers and 3D animators and stuff like that.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.680]   And have that go for a while.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.280]   I think they can do it.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.720]   Now, it's all in execution.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.400]   But I think that it's not this kind of doomsday scenario where we end up with,
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.480]   you know, simplified iPads that Apple's trying to force on power users.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.680]   I don't think--
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.200]   Oh, and I see what's wrong.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.800]   I think when we see the-- when we see iLife coming out with all of these full-screen modes
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.640]   and all of these things, I think this is preparation for moving those into iOS.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   You know, and I think that that's all--
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.480]   I mean, I think that we're going to have all those applications.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.160]   And eventually, we're going to have possibly some of the pro applications.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.400]   I think that actually one of the things that will get left behind--
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.000]   this is a concern for me-- is some of the pro applications that would be too hard to port.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.400]   You know, I think that's the-- you know, the Dell--
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.640]   I don't think that they're going to develop them at the same level.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.000]   That's just my opinion.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.800]   We're going to take a break.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   We have a great cast here, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core,
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.120]   Jason Snell, Editor-in-Chief of Macworld Magazine.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.160]   And he has a week off.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.000]   I'm Leo LaPorte, and we'll be back with more--
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.680]   MacTalk!
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.440]   Love it.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.320]   And just a little bit.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.000]   Actually, we have some iOS talk.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.200]   That'll be next.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.160]   But before we do, I do want to mention our friends at GoToAssistExpress,
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.000]   those great folks at Citrix take their remote access backbone and make it
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.840]   something that you in IT and support can really use.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.280]   GoToAssistExpress works Mac and PC.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.080]   You can fix a Mac from a PC, fix a PC from a Mac.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.640]   You know, it's a completely cross-platform.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.240]   We Mac users appreciate that.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.360]   It's fast and easy.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.200]   Your users don't have to have installed.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.000]   You know, I've been on a Skype call with people and said,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.040]   "Oh, you want something fixed?
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:41.440]   No problem.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.080]   Here's a link.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.120]   Pushes them to go to Assists.com.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.240]   30 seconds later, the software is installed, and I'm in.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.280]   I'm testing this weekend.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.400]   I would love you to test it.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.600]   My dad is having trouble with his computer at the house.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.400]   His iPad.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.320]   His iPod is full, and he doesn't quite have the whole process back.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.640]   You can't yet use it on an iPad or an iPod.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.920]   No, no, but I can use it on a Mac.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.120]   But I need to use it on his PC.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.840]   So I'm on a Mac.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.880]   I need to use it on his PC.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.680]   Oh, perfect.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.320]   So that I can look at his screen and figure out what and show him and walk him through that process.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.080]   So I'll have a report next week.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:12.880]   Good.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.080]   In fact, if you're in the situation where you have somebody you need to support right now,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.600]   you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:25.200]   Go to Assists.com/MacBreakGOTOAssist.com/MacBreak.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.760]   30 days unlimited use.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.960]   Now, let me tell you some of the things you get.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.480]   You can have up to eight sessions at once.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.240]   You can have unattended sessions.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:32.880]   You do an assay.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.960]   You can find out what software is running, what operating system,
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.240]   what antivirus or security software, anything running in the background.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.000]   Integrated live chat.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.880]   So while dad's watching you work, you can ask him questions.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.200]   It's just fantastic.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.640]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.040]   They do have day passes for people who do this from time to time.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.720]   But it's very affordable month to month for people who do this day in and day out.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.680]   If you're a support pro, this is really targeted at you.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.720]   Go to Assists.com/MacBreak.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.640]   Try it free for 30 days today.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.120]   I know.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   I know you're going to love it.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:03.760]   You're going to want it.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.480]   You're going to use it.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.080]   So Monday, I log into connect.apple.com and boom, butting, but I'm going to.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.520]   4.2 is available.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.600]   Gold Master, final release candidate.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.720]   Which is iOS 4.2.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.240]   What is in your experience, Jason?
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.400]   How soon does that mean we'll have it?
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:20.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.680]   That's a good question.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.920]   I'm not sure we have enough data.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.000]   I'd say it's probably in the next week or so.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.560]   I mean, at WWDC, they posted the GM and then a week or two later, it was out.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.640]   And that was the same build.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.520]   So I think unless there's some explosive problem,
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.920]   I think it will be out in the next couple of weeks.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.040]   And it looks great.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:48.800]   And iPad users are going to go ape for it because it is for iOS 4 on the iPad for the first time.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.720]   So multitasking is there.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.520]   It's there.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.000]   It's there.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.560]   Oh my gosh.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.040]   Oh my gosh.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.960]   Doesn't it have multitasking is so much better an experience than what you have with your iPad today.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.920]   It's not even close.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:06.800]   I have to say that my iPad feels so dated because I'm using my iPhone all the time with folders and multitasking.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.840]   I go back to my iPad and I'm like, oh, it really does one thing at a time.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.040]   I can't put anything in folders.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.440]   No, it's it's a you know, there aren't that many apps on the iPad yet that are
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.760]   all the developers are doing that right now, right?
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.920]   They're revving all their iPad apps to support for so that they'll get all of those multitasking
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:28.080]   features that are on the iOS, but I on the iPhone, but I've been trying it with a few universal apps
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.600]   that are therefore already multitasking native on the iPad.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:37.120]   iPad experience is so much better when you're able to, you know, quickly double tap switch to an app.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:42.080]   Members where you were, then you switch back. You know, it's not, it's not multitasking like
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:48.880]   multiple windows on a computer desktop, but it is so much closer than when you have to wake the,
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.080]   you know, you have to go back to app startup every time you switch apps, which is lame.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.400]   So it's a big, big step forward for iPad usability.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:02.560]   They put a notice on their site yesterday. Submit your iOS 4.2 apps,
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:10.160]   build, test and compile your apps to ISO 4.2, the GM seat, and then submit them for review so they
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.520]   can be ready when iOS 4.2 is available to iPad, iPad, iPhone and iPad touch users.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.320]   And that will probably be the gating factor in, in release as they want to give their developers
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.080]   time. So that maybe that means that it'll be two or three weeks just because they want to give
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:29.360]   their developers time to submit so that when the iOS does ship and customers are upgrading,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.160]   they're getting that good kind of app experience with all these background savvy apps.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:39.520]   It took a while though. Remember, you know, when iPhone went to 4.2, it took quite a while
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.680]   before we saw a lot of multitasking apps. So we're a handful to begin with. Yeah, but there's,
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.040]   there's some history now because they've got the code base. They've been doing it on the iPhone.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.120]   A lot of these apps already exist multitasking on the iPhone. I suspect it's not going to take,
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.280]   it's not going to take long. And I don't, Apple didn't seem to mind too much putting out 4.2
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.840]   with that on the iPhone without a lot of multitasking apps. In fact, how long?
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.920]   Yeah, they had some, they had some, some stars that they promoted and said, here are the multitasking
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:09.440]   ones. And Dora, Skype. Yeah. And you want to make sure that Skype finally out in multitask form?
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.440]   Yes. Okay. Of course, when you turn it on, I still, you know, you turn it on, you almost
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.280]   watch your battery go down. Yeah. We run in the background. Yeah. I mean, the next step for Apple
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.720]   is going to be notifications because they're, you know, now they're going to be multitasking
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.680]   apps and they're still pushing out those little bubbles that aren't just not, it's not good enough
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.640]   for a real multitasking experience. That's iOS 5. I think that's got to be the next frontier is
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.880]   doing a better way to have one app tell you that it needs you to do something that I also,
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.640]   I also need a way to block all of that that drives me a little nutty. You know, the, you know,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.400]   the, the, it ruins my angry birds experience when someone texts me.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.800]   You know, I mean, it's like I'm in the middle of, no, I got a bird in mid flight.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.520]   I got a bird in mid flight. And the next thing I know it's stuck in my mid. I turn off notifications
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:56.320]   because we rule all that stuff. I'll bug you, bug the hell out of you. But on the other hand,
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.720]   the Android style notifications, which is put it up at the top and you can slide it down so much
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:06.560]   more modern. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. The iOS stuff is, is like system seven school,
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:14.320]   modal, I mean, modal dialogue box that you're trapped in until you hit okay or cancel or some
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.920]   of, you know, some strange options. So it's just there's got to be a better way. They'll
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.560]   palm the web OS and Android both do a better job there. And I imagine that that'll be on the agenda
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.480]   for, for iOS five. I'm actually shocked that it's not in four, but they had to pick their battles
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:31.680]   and they, they dumped it. You have any ideas? I mean, uh, when before cutting pastes available,
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.600]   a lot of people speculated on how Apple would implement it. In fact, I think Apple did implement
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.360]   it pretty close to how most people thought they would. Any ideas how they might implement
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.920]   notifications, a better, more modern notification system. Do you copy Android? Do you copy palm?
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.960]   I doubt they'll copy anybody. They'll think about it for a long time. That's right. It'll take
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.560]   us a long time to get it. We'll wish that they had done it six months earlier, but it'll be great.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.680]   That'll be just what they said about copy and paste, right? Which I think they actually did it
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.600]   better than people expected, even the good implementations. They did it a little bit better.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:03.680]   But yeah, I still the idea of pulling down or somehow being able to sort of get to your list of
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.760]   notifications without it getting in your way. Yeah, they're going to do something that isn't
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.920]   exactly like Android, but I think we'll, we'll, you know, Steve Jobs will come out on stage. And
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.840]   he'll say, well, you know, Android does this and then web OS does this. And we think we've got a
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.480]   better way to do it. I mean, that's, that's Apple for you. But I do think they have to do it because
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.120]   it's kind of a mess. You got an I am over here and you've got, you know, a Skype session over here,
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.000]   and you get these buttons that you have to hit a button. You can't sort of delay it. And it's
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.600]   the more multitasking you do, the harder that is. A little change to the ping thing on iTunes.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:46.720]   It's ping still up. Your senior contributor at Macworld Kirk Kirk Macalern caught it. He says,
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:53.280]   iTunes now features a sort of hybrid iTunes sidebar where ping used to stand alone. It's a
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.520]   little ping, a little genius. A little genius. Yeah, they stuck some genius in there, which is
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.080]   good because, you know, genius, some of the genius data is actually kind of interesting based on
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:07.040]   what you're actually doing in iTunes versus ping, which is the social networking, which, you know,
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.960]   it hasn't really taken off. I was very excited about it and I don't use it anymore.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:15.840]   Yeah, I know. I only set the sidebar off. Yeah. All right. You. Here's, well, here's,
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.040]   here's the worst part is, is that, is that I got really excited about, and I started getting to
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:23.280]   the habit of doing like a post every day and then it broke. Like I suddenly couldn't, I couldn't
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.120]   use ping for like a week. I kept on trying to do it. You were the ping guy. I was like totally
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.360]   into it and it broke for like a week. And so I kept on trying to, to like go to a song and then,
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.960]   and then do a post about it. And I had this whole little problem because I used to be in the music
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.560]   industry. So I tell funny little stories about different bands and songs and stuff like that.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:42.960]   And I was really fascinated by the idea of being able to go to a song and immediately post about it.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.840]   And that didn't work for a week. And then I got out of the habit and then I didn't really get back
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.880]   into the habit. How interesting. You know, now when I go to my ping, where I go to iTunes and I go
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.360]   to the ping sidebar, it says iTunes, ping and everything, but all I don't even really get much
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:03.040]   ping in there anymore is ping a flop? Yeah. I think it's a flop. I think that,
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.720]   I suspect that Apple expected that it would be more tied into, let's say, Facebook than it actually
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.840]   is. Facebook let him down. How many social networks do you need? Now, the idea of taking stuff from
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.920]   iTunes and sticking it in my Facebook feed or my Twitter feed, that's kind of interesting if it's
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:23.200]   done right. And you know, there are some issues with ping really being focused on the iTunes store
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.720]   and not necessarily on the music in your library. It was really, I mean, who knows why it's like
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.240]   this, but it really is this sort of transparent ploy to get you to advertise things for your
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.680]   friends to buy on iTunes. And I think that this, I think that what could make a difference though,
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:44.000]   is that if you actually let people get a kind of an Amazon associate kind of income from making
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.160]   those recommendations, you would turn a whole different process on, you know, I suppose also
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:55.680]   tying it into your existing social networks would sure help. And you know, like I use Last FM and
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.560]   I've got the audio Scroblar app from Last FM open on my system. And that means that
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.960]   Last FM knows what I play every day and keeps charts and will make suggestions and all these
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.120]   things. Apple's got iTunes sitting right there. If Apple built that sort of thing in, let you
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.000]   opt in for all the privacy reasons and then was able to generate like Jason's charts and share it
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   with a friend and post it on Facebook. How great would that be? But instead, it's this kind of manual
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.560]   process. You have to, you have to be in the iTunes database. If it's a song iTunes doesn't know about,
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:30.480]   it can't help you. And it lives only on iTunes and it really ends up just being, it's just not
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.200]   not enough. There's not enough there to motivate people to use it as a social networking app. So
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.680]   they need to, they need to hook it in and they, you know, they need to do more with it or just kill
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:46.560]   it. But as it stands, it is a flop. Also big problems with spam, ping spam. Yeah. So FOS has
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:53.040]   pointed out that there was spam messages on many popular artists on the ping service. Apple,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:58.400]   apparently as of last night, deleted a lot of them or actually know this is older than that. But
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.960]   there was a, there was a big problem for a long time. Yeah, they're better at it. I mean,
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.480]   it's one of those things that Apple's not, it's not in the core competency of Apple to be
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:13.040]   moderators. And, you know, it's just, it's like when they did their, I review thing where they were
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.080]   reviewing websites. It's not what they are good at. And the scary thing is when we talked about
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:23.520]   mobile mirror layer is that ping is this sort of cloud service a little bit. And, you know,
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:28.000]   I'm not convinced that they really get it. And that's a little scary because this is the future
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.080]   is stuff like this. And you want to do it right. And with ping, maybe there's extenuating
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.840]   circumstances. Maybe they really thought that Facebook was a part of it and that fell apart at
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.240]   the end. But I think that's probably what it's not it. Yeah. Yeah. Because it would be much more
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:46.080]   useful if it was tied into Facebook. Although still it's got to, it's got to watch what you're
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.720]   doing when you're playing music. It can't just, if everything is manual. Yeah, it has to
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.200]   scrouble. I mean, audio scroubler is great. It's just, I mean, I love this stuff. But the idea that
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.440]   you can say, Hey, you know what, what songs have I been listening to the last six months? What
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.800]   are my favorite songs from the last six months? Because somebody's asking me what I'm listening
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.240]   to and I don't know. And I want to recommend something to them. My last FM page has has those
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.760]   charts. You can actually see what I listen to when I can share those with friends or I can keep
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.400]   private. But I know and it's pretty cool. That would be something great for Ping. But it's not there.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.040]   I think the other thing is that I don't use, I find that I just don't use iTunes as a place
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.960]   that I hang out. You know, I go there to watch some stuff. I go there to play stuff in the
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:30.480]   world. Mostly I use it to sink my eye. Such a Ping fanatic. I know. I'm going to say,
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:35.680]   though, tell the world why Ping. I was wrong. I just want to say, oh man, that hurts.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:42.880]   That's got to hurt. You know, it's all I got to say. I was excited. I was, you know,
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:48.000]   I was excited about it. What was nice about it was, is I did it was a lot less work for me to just
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.040]   link to a song and talk about it. And I, you know, and I like the idea of talking about it.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:58.480]   You bought into the promise of Ping, but it just didn't deliver. You know, and so,
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.560]   so the thing is I could see where it could go and I got excited about wanting to be part of that.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.640]   And I just don't see it going there right now. And you know, Apple sometimes puts this stuff
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.560]   out. It doesn't work immediately. And then they, and then they sort things out, but usually not.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:15.360]   It's not the same thing. It doesn't. Yeah. It does have so many customers. Apple has so many
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:21.680]   customers. The data is really kind of rich. It could go somewhere, but I think that Apple's
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.560]   going to have to break out of its out of its silo and stick this out on other services for it
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.880]   to really work. I also think that that I, you know, and I've said this before, but I really think
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.920]   that Apple is missing. I know that they don't think that people want to have a subscription
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.800]   service, but subscription services are really cool. They got it. You know, and the thing is,
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.560]   is that if you add it, if you add it in a subscription service, then Ping becomes a whole
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.240]   different thing because now I can put up songs and no one has to buy them. They're all listening
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.000]   to them. I can put up playlists and people can just go listen to them. And I, if Apple added that,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.800]   the thing works. Right. And how great would that be if you could actually listen to the playlists,
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.720]   but no, you have to buy it. Right. That's the whole thing is that people, they don't, they can
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.840]   take my word for it. I can tell a little story, but if everyone could listen to the, the song that
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.320]   I'm recommending from the late 80s or early 90s or whatever, and actually just put it in their
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.040]   playlists or if I could do a best of the 90s, best of the early 90s that you never heard,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.840]   you know, like that's the kinds of I can do because I used to be a music director. And then
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.840]   people would download that without risking anything. They could just download and listen to it. This
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:23.360]   mixed with the zoom type marketplace, you know, would be incredible. You know, it would be the
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:28.320]   end of everything else. And maybe that's why, you know, what that data center is for though. I mean,
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.720]   that's another possibility is really iTunes cloud stuff. Now, whether it's a subscription or it's
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.880]   just sort of, we know you own this and so we'll let you play it back via streaming. I don't know.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.360]   But you know, subscriptions not going to necessarily be a mainstream product, but as an add on,
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:45.680]   we've got people here who totally swear by like Chris Breen is a subscription fanatic. And it's
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.080]   great because he's got pretty eclectic music tastes and he can sample. And for some people,
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.920]   they're going to be happy with what they've got. And that's fine too. A lot of these subscription
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.200]   services have been, you know, you pay to subscribe and then maybe you can buy some stuff and either
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:05.120]   or I don't think necessarily works. But if Apple can lay a premium subscription service on top of
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:09.120]   all the cart iTunes, that could be huge. Yeah. I mean, and now that I think that the separation
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.640]   can be very clear on pay with the subscription service. I mean, the problem with the zoom,
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.440]   I have a zoom and I use it when I especially when I travel, I have a zoom that has just just
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:21.200]   packed with music. And a lot of times it's music that I haven't heard yet. My brother talks about
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:28.560]   it and I put it on my thing because it's free. And then but now I can buy stuff that has no DRM
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:35.920]   that is pretty high quality, 256 bit or whatever. And so I can buy that or I can just choose to be
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:41.280]   at the wash of, you know, at the whim of my 30 day thing and knowing that those are the two options
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.040]   that I have. And I just think it would be and especially if Apple did it because they already
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:50.080]   have so such a huge installed base, I do think the biggest concern that they would have was they
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.120]   would be in have a serious antitrust, you know, issue not too far down the future because there'd
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.640]   be nothing left. I mean, I think that if they did that, maybe that's why they just might be
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.960]   why try not to dominate too completely. I mean, there'd be nothing left. I mean, if they did that,
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.720]   that was just it would be, you know, because they already have the installed base. Let's speculate.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:11.200]   What else if okay, let's okay, there's speculation number one, the North Carolina data facility,
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:18.640]   speculation could be could be for streaming music. What else Jason might Apple do? I mean,
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.520]   do we know much about the capacity? We just know that they built their own dedicated data center.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.160]   I know there's a big building there and it's got stuff in it. It's not as it is all speculation,
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:33.520]   but I guess it's a lot of excerpts. It was finished a while ago. I mean, it's not like it's not ready
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.120]   to go online. I mean, they've got stage two in progress. Well, they've got a lot. I mean,
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.680]   they are moving a lot of data now, but I mean, it is fun to speculate. And I think that media in
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.560]   general, if you look at the Apple TV and it's all streaming, the idea that you no longer right now,
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:51.120]   when you buy something from Apple, a media file, whether it's a movie or a TV show,
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:55.600]   you can only download it once. You're actually not. I think there's a licensing agreement with
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.480]   the studios. You can't download it more than once, which is why, for example, you can't buy
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.480]   something on the new Apple TV. It would be seem to make a lot of sense that you could say, okay,
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.720]   I want to buy this. Now, stream it to me on my Apple TV. And later when I check in on my Mac,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:13.440]   that's interesting. I can get it there, but sorry, one download per customer. That's how it works.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:17.680]   So if they can shift that around a little bit and make it more that once you buy it,
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:23.520]   you get to stream it, it's in your locker, then they would need a huge amount of storage and bandwidth
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:28.960]   and all of that. But that's one path for them that really goes to that streaming model while
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.400]   keeping the Alacart alive too. So I think that's a huge possibility. And then the whole
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:39.040]   Google thing of saying, we're going to do, we're going to roll out a mobile me for everybody who
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.600]   buys a piece of our hardware for the life of the hardware or for a couple of years or at a certain
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.160]   base level and you can pay more to upgrade, that's going to be a lot of systems that that's a lot
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:53.440]   more people using mobile me than use it today. So that would require a lot as well. And those
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:59.360]   are for me, those are my two best guesses about what is happening behind the walls of that mysterious
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:05.280]   facility. Yeah, that's both of those seem fairly likely and reasonable. Anything maybe off the wall?
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:10.400]   No, I know I'm usually Leo's looking for me. He's looking remember notice when he says off the wall,
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:16.800]   straight at me. What about it? Mr. Off the wall? I think that it's either a kind of a Google Docs
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.920]   kind of thing or a media service thing or both. But I think that those are probably the most most likely
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.160]   solutions that they're that they're working on. And I think that I think that was technology.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.080]   I mean, I think that's alien tech. Well, there's I didn't they don't want you to know.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.000]   I like that. I couldn't talk about that. I couldn't talk about that. You know,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.600]   our bell was on the coast to coast on Halloween night and I think it just got you in the mood for
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:44.640]   yes, something wack. But I think that we've seen, you know, I work, you know, the, they started
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.960]   experimenting with the idea that you could review stuff that was done in circle and everything else,
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.400]   which I thought was completely missed the boat. No, there is a there is a there is a
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.320]   that was the first step. It seems to me now and you see it with Google, you see it with Microsoft,
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.840]   you're seeing it with Apple for the first time. Maybe not the first time, but this this thing
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.960]   endemic in the tech industry where you start an initiative and then just kind of
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:08.320]   dribbles on. But I think that there was a lot I work as a great example. I love the idea that
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.960]   you could put your stuff on the cloud. You could share presentations and it's fine. It's there.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.240]   It's sitting there. They don't promote it. They don't have done anything to it. I don't. I mean,
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.280]   the thing is, is that I think the problem is you can't edit it up there. You know, and that's
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:23.840]   that and that was the and I think that I know what they do. I think to add, right? I haven't done
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:27.600]   a thing. Well, right. It's just been sitting there and it's it's not just the editing. It's the
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:32.240]   round tripping and you even see that now in the iPad where you can open the things from iWork.com,
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.400]   but then when you save them back, you have to save them to a new file and they don't sink and
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.560]   it's just, you know, again, Google Docs isn't perfect, but Google Google Docs is better at that
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.040]   sort of thing. So hopefully there's a phase. And it's under development. I mean, not that Google
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:50.320]   doesn't let things slide. I mean, there's a hundred projects that Google bought or adopted or created
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.480]   and nothing happened with them. So I mean, it's in the same thing in Microsoft. It just seems like
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.520]   10 companies these days. I guess they throw a lot of stuff against the wall and they have to pick
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.120]   sticks. The collaboration stuff, I think, is pretty complicated. I mean, you know, I just noticed
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.040]   that there are times when I'm working a lot of times we're working before shows on Google Docs
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:11.120]   and, you know, things are, you know, I start typing something and then it conflicts with
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.400]   something that someone else is typing with. So dealing with those pass-offs is pretty
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:19.040]   complicated, actually. The issue, though, is I think that the Holy Grail as a Mac user is being
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.760]   able to work in pages, do everything, and then upload it and let someone else edit it, you know,
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.200]   quickly and easily, and then be able to bring it back into pages and theoretically work offline
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:31.680]   in applications that I want to use, whether it's pages or like, for instance, if I'm creating a
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:37.040]   spreadsheet, I unfortunately do it, not unfortunately, but I do a lot of spreadsheets. Very, they become
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:43.840]   fairly complex. And I do them in numbers because I hate Excel. And the only thing I hate more than
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:47.520]   Excel for spreadsheets is Google spreadsheets, which is the most... That's the worst.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:52.560]   Acinine. I mean, so here's what I do is I build the whole thing. I build the core of my spreadsheet
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:57.520]   in numbers, which is the best thing to build a spreadsheet on. It's just the fastest. And then
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:02.800]   I save it as an Excel file. And then I email it to myself to get it into Google Docs. Everyone
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.160]   else can work with it from there on. You know, and the thing is because that's the, the math's the
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.080]   most efficient, in my opinion, way to do it because the Google Docs version of spreadsheets is just,
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:16.640]   you just, I just want to shoot myself. Yeah. Here's, you know, it's, it's hard stuff. This stuff is hard.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:20.800]   Is I guess what you're saying. And I think that, but I would love to be able to have
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.320]   numbers, be able to build things in numbers and then make them available online through my
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.160]   Doc account. But let people continue to add that. Well, that's what I was saying. There's a huge
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:33.040]   prep promise in this. Right. And it's just, they, they, they, they push the button, they turn it on,
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.840]   but then it never loses. Well, I think it takes a lot of work. I mean, trying to get that to
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.360]   integrate back and forth with applications rather than web pages. And that's one thing we know about
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:45.040]   Apple is that they liked laser-like focus on one thing at a time. And it almost is like the,
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:50.240]   you know, the eye of Sauron, Steve Eye, the bail for eye of Sauron. It can only look at one
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:54.400]   thing at a time. It's a big, it's a big, to the Steve Eye is a big blue eye with, I always imagine
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.800]   it as this huge blue eye with a turtleneck, black turtleneck. Yeah. That's, that's pretty much how
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:05.200]   I understand to. But you know, the fact that iWork.com is just sort of laid there, I might actually speak,
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.360]   either they've just totally abandoned it or somebody at some point, maybe Steve, who knows,
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:14.480]   said this is not working. We need a better strategy for this whole thing. And they're working on it
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:17.520]   now. And you know, it's Apple. So they're not going to do the little, you know, we're making
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.200]   incremental progress. We added a button over here. Instead, they just work on it in secret.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:25.120]   They don't do anything. They don't say anything about it. They act as if the thing doesn't exist.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:29.840]   And then they flip a switch. And that may be what's going on. We just don't, just don't know.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:34.080]   That, well, I understand that that's Apple's way. It's kind of old-fashioned in the web 2.0
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:37.120]   universe where you launch and iterate in public.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:41.040]   Trying it with the mobile B beta, right? The mobile B beta, the calendar beta,
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:46.400]   the mail beta, those they did, they did a soft launch and they did some iteration in beta. So
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:53.120]   they're, they're trying. The ping beta. Yeah. You know, well, they can't all be gems, folks.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:58.640]   So they're trying it. And we'll see how they do it is new for them. It is not, you know, services,
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:03.440]   online services. It's not what Apple is traditionally good at in their learning. And it's,
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:07.520]   I think Apple, you know, Apple's a company with a lot of pride. And I think it's hard for them to
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:12.800]   put out a product that they're not proud of. And yet at some point they sort of have to give it a
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:17.120]   go and learn. And some of that learning is going to come with pain. And we've seen that with pain.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.760]   And we've seen that with, with, with, uh, I work.com and with mobile me. And the question is, are they,
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.840]   are they learning enough to make it work? Or are they maybe who knows buying companies that are
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.200]   full of people who know how to make it work and then having them build it for them? A lot of the
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.600]   companies Apple buys, they don't buy it for the tech necessarily. They buy it sometimes for the
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:38.720]   people because they think these people are really smart and like they built like law law.com is gone
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.520]   now. It's unclear whether Apple's going to replicate law law or not. But clearly Apple wanted those
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:48.080]   people who were really good at internet streaming stuff for something. Well, and that is, that is,
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:53.120]   by the way, another Silicon Valley thing to do, which is buy the company for the people. In fact,
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.760]   it just happened. And the hard thing is keeping the people because the hard part for Google and
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.960]   Apple sometimes, for Apple, Facebook is an example. And I think it's because they have an imminent
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:07.680]   IPO. There's an imminent cash event for these people and they're all rubbing their hands. But I
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:12.480]   look at what they did with Friend Feed. They bought it and they really just wanted Brett Taylor and
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.480]   Paul Boohite and they just, they wanted the talent and they've used the talent Facebook just, and
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:21.760]   I'm really depressed, kill dropio. I don't know if you know that service, DROP.io, Sam Lesson is a
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.000]   brilliant, brilliant guy. And it was a really nice service. It allowed you just to kind of throw
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.840]   stuff up on the cloud. Sometimes it's people and patents, right? I mean, and
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:34.480]   everything is a patents here. I think it's just people. Mark Zuckerberg has said we've never
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:39.120]   acquired a company for the company's assets. It's always been for the people. So I could see
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.960]   Apple doing that with La La. That makes perfect sense. That's fine. If Apple's pitched to the
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.720]   employees of La La is iTunes is huge. You're going to be a part of iTunes. You're going to take
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.880]   to the next generation. You're the next generation. Yeah. Yeah. You're the next iTunes, folks.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:56.480]   That's, I mean, yeah. And it's Apple. Although you have to think it certainly helps that Apple's
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:03.280]   stock is like, compared to Microsoft or Google. If there are some company that's going to go in
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.240]   and buy another company just to raid the people and put them to work, Apple's in a pretty good
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.080]   position there. Google probably is too, where you're really saying, look, you want to be,
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.240]   you're get called up to the big leagues. Yeah, that's the bigs. That's the bigs, isn't it?
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:21.440]   Yeah. Google's having trouble because it is the bigs. And people like Colleen, my chief of
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:26.240]   engineering here, who was just, she said, when I hired her, she said, I'm here until Google hires
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:33.040]   me. And that's fine. It's like, we're AAA. Go ahead. But I think now Facebook and Apple really have
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:37.040]   the stock that's going through the roof. And that's really something that's one of the
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.240]   biggest stocks that I've seen. There are people that I've talked to that have worked at
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.480]   all of those companies. And some of them have left. And a lot of it is just a cultural thing.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.280]   It's not so much the money is that they get there and it's a corporation.
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.960]   Well, that's right. They were used to living in it.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.760]   What happened to the, to the Naveen and the Dodgeball guys, they went to,
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.240]   to Google for Dodgeball. Google went, yeah, nice to have you. We don't know what the hell to do with
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:00.480]   you. And you know, they started, they left and started four square. You know, I think that happens
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:05.520]   all the time. Right. Unfortunately. Let's take a break, come back with more. Jason Stell is here
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:12.560]   from Macworld Magazine, Macworld.com, the website. Is a magazine ever? This is, I hate to challenge you
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:18.480]   here, Jason. But I see PC Magazine stop printing. I see a lot of magazines no longer printing.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.280]   Is Macworld committed to a print edition? Yeah. And it's a very profitable.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.520]   Good. You know, the idea, one thing that we did that a lot of publishers didn't do,
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:31.760]   that full credit to the IDG people who made this decision is, you know, you don't keep a print
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:38.000]   magazine around for pride and have it like break even or lose money. Make sure that it stays alive
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.920]   and is profitable and continues to contribute to the bottom line. And the fact is, we got great
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:47.200]   readers. They love to subscribe and it continues to make us money. So we're not going to say,
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:51.760]   let's dump it because it actually is a good business. And the website is another good business.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.440]   And it's not neither or. So yeah, I think we're in it for quite a while.
[00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.960]   That's, I'm really pleased to hear that. And I am very, I don't think, do you have
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:06.960]   the full magazine on available on the iPad now? On the iPad. Yeah, there's through Zinnio right
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.200]   now. You can get the digital replica. And then we're working on an iPad app that is not going to
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:15.680]   be a magazine replica. It's going to be stuff that's fed from the stuff we do day in day out on the
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.480]   website. Because we end up, you know, on the website, if you read our website every day,
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.920]   and I know some people out there do, I do, that's like 20, 25 articles a day, that would take,
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:32.000]   we could fill a weekly magazine with that content and have stuff left over. It's a print magazine
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.160]   is really this like cut down curated best of the month kind thing now, pictures and stuff. So,
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.360]   so on the iPad, we got two options. You can do the magazine digital replica magazine thing. And
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.680]   then we're going to do an app that's that's basically going to be a reader app that's sort of curated
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.320]   stuff from off. I'd love to have something like a flip book for Mac Mac world. I mean,
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:56.640]   you kind of can you just add Mac world. I mean, that's that's I mean, I do that now to some
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.600]   degrees. It's what my problem with flip book is always that I have to go back to the way,
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.360]   you know, go to the web view. I just want it to be like that. Some of this you can play an apple
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:10.800]   for because like New Yorker or a lot of magazines are just selling either selling a new app every
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.320]   month or every week or they're you know, they're doing because if you do it's my understanding,
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.680]   if you do in app purchase, what you'd like to do is have a Mac world app and they could in app
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.160]   purchase the magazine or maybe even better yet. If you're already subscribed to the paper magazine,
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:33.120]   you get a discount or free version on the iPad and Apple says to people who are doing in app
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.400]   purchases, we're not going to you can't have any of the information. We keep it all to ourselves.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.240]   Right. The in app purchase rules are very specific. Subscriptions are hard to implement Apple.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.680]   Their Apple customer is not publishers customers. They've got to fix that.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.200]   That's the trick. So different publishers are trying it in different ways. And I think
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.520]   the other big missing piece here is that when the iPad came out, a lot of us thought that Apple
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.760]   would have a story for newspaper and magazine publishers like what Amazon has with Kindle.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.400]   And it's just not there. So a lot of us are developing apps and developing apps is really
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.560]   expensive. And that's so what's going to happen is Apple going to come out with an I, you know,
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.560]   I new stand for iPad in the next six months that makes all of this app investment irrelevant
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:19.120]   because you'll all just do it through Apple. You know, there are always about that. But is Apple
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.640]   going to take 30% and say that the customers aren't yours. They're theirs. Publishers hate that because
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   that's one way publishers make money is knowing who their customers are and being able to market
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.200]   stuff. I was really surprised. I mean, Steve Jobs went to a Wall Street Journal with his funny hat.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:38.000]   And it looked before the iPad came out and it looked like that they were really doing an outreach
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.200]   to publishers. And that in fact, I think a lot of publishers thought that this would be the
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:49.600]   save the iPad would be the savior for print magazines. And it's really proven to be not such a great
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.840]   platform. Both of the publishers and their model users. I hate to have to buy Time Magazine
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.680]   every week. I hate the New Yorker. I have to buy an issue that's subscribe today if I could subscribe
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.960]   to those. But I'm not going to buy. I'm not going to use it as a newsstand where you're paying four
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:08.000]   times as much as you would for a subscription. I want to subscribe. So it's bad for everybody.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.040]   Yeah. And I think that I think that also the you and I or all of us, I think, have a podcast. We
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.280]   don't know anything about our viewers. I mean, those things are I mean, we we know them from from
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:23.440]   what are our other social things. Well, we actually do. I think you're wrong. I do know exactly.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.680]   Because we and that's one of the reasons and iTunes lets us do this. We redirect the URL to our
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.560]   advertising agency Podtrack. We know a lot about our users. That's right. My podcast goes to Feed
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.280]   Burner and or feed. Even gotten better with this. But if you're if you're if you're you'll know what
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.040]   your sales are, though, I mean, how do you you know, you'll know what your sales are for if you're
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.800]   if you're doing an in-app purchase, we know locations, we know how they download it. We know an awful lot
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:52.400]   about our audience. More much more. Much more than any magazine is going to know because Apple won't
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.640]   tell them a thing. Right. Because I mean, we're looking at doing a bunch of in-app type things.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.840]   And from from my perspective, all I'm looking at is, you know, how many people bought it.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.760]   You know, that's that's the that's the thing that I'm interested in. Because then I'm going to
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.680]   be working on, you know, we'll have other online ways for them to be interacting with us and within
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.840]   the application of them being able to sign up to things and be connected to us for the people who
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.680]   choose to do that. So the people who people who buy stuff from us, you know, ongoing content,
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.680]   but they'll also be social areas where they're, you know, where they're, you know,
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.360]   interconnecting with us directly, depending on, you know, the people who are really
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:28.720]   committed to that. Well, and I bring it up because Jason, I know you must spend many of your
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.920]   cycles on this issue. Oh, yeah. You know, yeah, it's it's and nobody knows. I mean,
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.280]   that's the big thing. There's this great mystery about what's the right way to do it. And if you
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.280]   talk to Conde Nast or Time Warner, they'll say, well, what we're doing is we're going to lay out the
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.960]   magazine and we're going to make these big image files and we're going to cram them together.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:51.840]   And and it's kind of cool, but I'm not convinced that taking a print page and replicating it on
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:57.440]   an iPad or some other tablet is ultimately the way to go. That's like saying, hey, we have TV
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.160]   now let's take stage plays and put cameras in the audience. And that's what we did broadcast.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:08.320]   Right. Right. Exactly. So it's like using an old mediums metaphor to start out in a new medium.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.000]   And that I mean, that's one of the reasons why Macworld we're not, you know, we're not building
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.520]   our app for the iPad is not going to be a magazine replica because we think that's not where it's
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:23.120]   going. Now we might have taken the wrong tack to we'll we'll see what what nobody really knows
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.760]   what's going to happen. But I'm not convinced it's anything more than transitional to have these
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.560]   kind of big paper magazine equivalents. That said, I'd love to be able to cancel some of my magazine
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:36.640]   subscriptions and get them on my iPad because I wouldn't have to carry them around and recycle them.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:41.200]   And and I can imagine that IDG is not thrilled to have to spend a lot of money on on app development
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.640]   that could be completely wasted. And yeah, right now it's more R&D. Like, let's try this and figure it
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.480]   out. Yeah. Yeah. And the good thing about IDG is when we build this app, we're going to be able to
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:55.760]   turn it around. And if you know, IDG and Poland and Germany and Sweden, if they want to use a version
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:01.040]   of it for their stuff, they'll be able to do that. So IDG is going to get some money out of their
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:05.840]   investment or some some app out of their investment. But lots of publishers can't do that or aren't
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:10.240]   willing to do that. And then you look at something like Time Warner, where they've got deep pockets,
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.920]   but they were they were laying out Sports Illustrated three different times. I mean,
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.800]   how many designers do you need a magazine? Magazine development is like web development.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.120]   Magazine development, you've got designers and copy editors who are laying out every single page
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.840]   in great detail. And editors were cutting it to fit line by line, right? You know, on the web,
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.720]   you slap it in, press save and it goes up and it's as long as it is. In the magazine, you got to get
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:37.920]   it to fit exactly and make sure the brakes work right and get the photography and, you know,
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:43.120]   worry about the font. And so to take that to another medium and then maybe lay it out a different
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:48.320]   way for the iPad, that's so expensive. And even Time Warner finally said, you know what,
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.720]   we're not going to do Sports Illustrated in a custom portrait version for the iPad because
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:57.920]   it's too much work. So I just I don't believe that that's where the stuff's going.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:02.720]   And I think that the unfortunate thing for a lot of these magazines is that if they don't
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.120]   dive into that soon, they're going to be able to, you know, right now the opportunity for magazine,
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.040]   I just you know, is that they need to convert. I disagree. I think you can wait. I think you can
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.600]   wait because I know well, I just know that I read a lot less magazines. I mean, there's basically
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.960]   three magazines that I'm going to pick up at the store. Well, but I think look at the Mac world
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.800]   economists and wired. Yeah, look at the Mac world model. They've got advertisers. So they're able
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.480]   to be profitable, they're able to survive. I think you could tread water a little bit. I don't think
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.600]   this is happening overnight. I think if it's me and it's kind of the attitude we're taking at
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:37.040]   Toyota's we're watching, we're making apps, but we're watching because I think we're in a very unstable
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.800]   and moving platform. I don't think you need to commit, but I do think you need to do something.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.920]   I think that what Mac world for instance is doing of experimenting and figuring that what I do.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.960]   Yeah, no, that's not if you have it. That's not a bad thing to do. I think you need to take
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:50.640]   that audience because I think that most magazines, their audiences are dwindling.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.680]   Do you? So you said you're going to lose the audience if you don't do something. The problem is
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.560]   you want to move that audience from. Let's look at the New Yorker, which is a non-technical
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.320]   publication. For a long time, they kind of eschewed electronic publication. They eventually did the
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.840]   Kindle, but they weren't on the Kindle even when it launched. Now they have an iPad app.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.560]   They've, Conde's moved very slowly with New Yorker. It's a print magazine and it's for readers.
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:15.040]   And I think it's perfectly okay for them to do that. I think if I were the New Yorker, I would,
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.280]   I might not have launched that application even. I might have.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.840]   Well, at this point, yeah, I mean, one of the advantages of being at a tech magazine is that
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.760]   we're. You've got early adopters. Our readers are ahead of the curve, right? So that's going to be
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:30.720]   an issue and that's good and that's bad. But you look at something like what Conde is doing with
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:35.920]   print and, you know, yeah, you can do that. They can get away with that. I think that our fear is
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.960]   a lot of our readers are going to say, and we're already saying, yeah, you know, I don't need
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.920]   print anymore. And so our, our, our issue is how do we continue our relationship with them? And I
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.440]   mean, that's why we did, we just launched this thing called Macworld Insider, which is a whole
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.400]   bunch of website features that's essentially a digital subscription to Macworld.com. And one of
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:00.560]   the reasons we did that is because we want to give our loyal readers an option to stay with us,
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:05.440]   even if they decide that print is, is over for them. And, and we'll see, we'll continue to grow
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:09.360]   that product. But I mean, that was a big motivator, to be honest, is just to say, we've got these,
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.440]   you know, hundreds of thousands of people who love Macworld and give us money every year.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.560]   Can we give them something else so that if they say, you know, see in print, that they're not saying
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.960]   goodbye, we're never going to see you ever again. And, you know, that's the, that's the trick. That's
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:27.920]   the challenge. Yeah, I can see that. I do. I can't see that. Let's take a break. Jason Snell is here.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.280]   I started to take a break and then we got in this conversation, which is great. I'm glad he's the
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:38.560]   editor in chief of Macworld magazine from pixel core.com. Mr. Alex Lindsey. A nice smile is here.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.520]   And he not goes the day off. I'm Leo report and I want to talk to you about
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:47.120]   Gazelle. If you have gadgets, we all have gadgets that are lying around, taking up space.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:52.400]   They're, they're, they're just sitting there and you'd like to maybe make a little bit of money.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.240]   If you'd like to make a little bit of money, I want to tell you about Gazelle.com. Don't sell it.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:06.160]   Gazelle it. If you go to G A Z E L L E dot com and just let's say, what do you have lying around?
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.080]   Give me, give me an example, Alex, something, something you haven't sold yet that you're not
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:15.920]   using, maybe a GPS, an iPod. I've got some cameras. Cameras are a great example. Let's say you have
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.080]   a Panasonic, Alex, three. Oh, an Alex three. You're not using that anymore? No, no, really.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.480]   That's a great old camera. It is. I'm moving on though. Let's type in panics. I don't know what I'm
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.520]   going to do. I have so many lemons. Lumix, uh, TZ three. Let's see. Oh, wait, I have a better one.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:34.400]   Oh, yeah. Go ahead. My few, my Fuji W one because I'm about to get a W three. Fuji W one. So you
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:40.080]   type it in. See if there it is. The real 3D Fuji W one. Okay. Is it able to take pictures, Alex?
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.880]   Yes. Is a perfect condition because you can't use it twice. No, no, I've used it a lot. It's
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.920]   really good. This is the 3D camera. I love my little 3D camera. You have all the,
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.360]   you have all the gear. By the way, look at this at the bottom. They have a price
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.960]   graph as the price history. So they're, they're, they're now they're expecting a big drop. Well,
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.680]   not yet because they're expecting a drop, right? Because the note, because what here's what's
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.440]   happening is the new one comes in new ones, new ones shipping. So this is a great example of
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.400]   you want the new one. You can get 200. And that's pretty good. 283 dollars for that one towards
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:13.600]   the new one. Now, what happens if you click on fair? How much does it go down by? Let's see.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:19.600]   Calculate from 283 to 246. Now, of course, what happens is they're going to send you a box and
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.520]   postage. They pay the postage. You load that box up with crap, all the stuff you don't want.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.800]   And they will then assess it. They'll remove data from anything that's got data on it. They do that.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.360]   They also assess it. If it matches your, you know, if it really is what you said it was,
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.960]   they're going to send you a check for that amount. But of course, sometimes people overestimate the
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.280]   value of what they're saying. It's really poor condition. They say perfect or whatever. So they're
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.280]   going to make, they're going to say, here's the, here's the offer. You can reject it at any time.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:49.440]   But if you accept it, they send you a check and your items are sold. Now, not just stuff that's
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:56.480]   saleable. Gazelle also recycles, green recycling. It will never end up in the landfill. They will
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.440]   make sure that it would local US based recyclers that are EPA certified, that it gets handled properly.
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.320]   So this is great for recycling. You know, I have a whole bunch of computers at the office.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.000]   Maybe I'll just send them to Gazelle. Exactly. They'll send you the box that paid the box.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.120]   You can also fund a cause. You can set up a page for your, your team.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:25.440]   You set up a page for your school and have a gadget drive. G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com. Don't sell it,
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.760]   Gazelle. Products in 20 categories, 200,000 unique items, pretty much anything in your,
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:36.320]   in your box could be Gazelle. Folks, I want you to, I want you to dispose of your gadgets
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.080]   properly and I don't want them to clutter up your house. Well, that's been, that's been our problem
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.600]   is we have all these older Macs and PCs and stuff that are sitting in the office and we don't
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.680]   really know what to do with them. Yeah, nobody does. This is, you know, life in the gadget world.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:51.760]   I didn't think of sending the whole computers back to them. Yeah. I was thinking of lots of
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:57.600]   little gadgets. I'm, I'm, I'm there. Gazelle.com, the offer code. I'm just want to make sure because
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.560]   they sometimes they change it. Yeah, the offer code is Mac break. So here's, by the way, I didn't
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.640]   mention this, but you do the whole thing at Gazelle at the end when you're checking out,
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.360]   just put in the coupon code Mac break, you get 5% more. Just like a little bonus as a thank you.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.000]   Nice. That makes it a lot easier. The W3 I've been kind of waiting on and looking at and
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.680]   hemming it on 500 bucks. But I was like, if I even got $200 back, I'd be, it really cuts the edge
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.080]   honest. You could go on to eBay and sell it yourself. You might get, you might get 20 or 30
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.560]   bucks more maybe. But the risk and the trouble and everything in this is like 100 different
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.120]   things. So I think, yeah, exactly. What's your time worth? Gazelle.com offer code Mac break. Try it
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:41.520]   today. Oh, there's so much to talk about. Let me go back to the rundown that our
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:48.320]   esteemed producer, Eileen has prepared for us. Apple suing Motorola right back over six patents.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:56.560]   I stopped reporting lawsuits. It's just ridiculous. It's just, it's just, it's a shame.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:01.600]   It's all lawyers getting leverage over other lawyers. And it is the most boring thing in,
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.000]   in patents and lawsuits and for gabbles. And we've got two lawyers in studio who are
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.960]   nodding briskly. Of course, they're from Canada. It's a whole different litigation is
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.800]   completely different in Canada. Yeah, sort of. Sort of, sort of. In Canada, don't they just run
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.320]   a race in the fastest person wins? That's right. That's Canadian law, right? That's right.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.160]   It's like Alice in Wonderland. I think though that don't, if you lose a lawsuit, don't you have to
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.280]   pay it? Like, isn't there kind of a slap kind of a thing in Canada? Yeah. And I think that that
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:33.760]   kind of is a good disincentive to against. It's a, it's instead of not to file frivolous lawsuits.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.160]   You should have some merit in your lawsuit or it's going to cost you. Yeah. I think that's good
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:44.160]   policy. We have that in California. We have slap. Folks in Europe woke up an hour early
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:49.120]   on Sunday. Did that happen in Canada too? I don't know. Do we, we haven't changed our daylight
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.080]   savings time yet, but there's a bug in the iPhone. Oh, it's actually, I think I
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.400]   didn't even bigger bug than that. Some people in the US were saying that their, their clock app
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:04.720]   went off early, which is weird because it's the wrong direction and there
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.920]   shouldn't even do that. Something is really weird in the daylight savings code of the iOS
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.760]   and how it interacts with the clock app, which I think is part of the issue here is like the clock
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:19.120]   app gets confused and doesn't pick up the new time. And so yeah, basically for the next week or so,
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.600]   don't rely on your iPhone alarm clock. So you know, you know what? In Europe, they changed to
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:29.200]   summer time. They changed away from summer time this past weekend. The iPhone's regular clock.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:36.400]   This is according to a story in Mac world. The iPhone's actually reliable. Yeah, I think pretty
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.560]   relaxed. I think this is probably your European brothers here. I don't know. Yes. Let me check.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:45.360]   Yeah, UK, Mac world UK. The iPhone's regular clock can handle the change and automatically
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:52.560]   steps back an hour. But the alarm clock doesn't. Yeah, because a clock app is running in the
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.760]   background and it apparently isn't isn't checking to see if the time zone has changed.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.120]   Since it was set. Yeah, I'll tell you, I'll tell you what's really weird is. So that means you,
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.720]   by the way, if you relied on the alarm in Europe, you would wake up an hour late, but you have an
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.760]   excuse. So what's wrong with that? Excuses are good. I'm sorry, my iPhone broke. I think this is
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.720]   just a good a good time to repeat the call for the elimination of daylight savings time. What
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.400]   I have to read stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. But wait a minute now. You stupid. You don't
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.840]   want daylight saving. So we would be I don't care what we have. Just leave it the same. Like,
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.760]   I don't like waking up in the dark. So can you handle that for your whole thing is just pick one.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.960]   Just pick it. I just don't want to wake up in the dark. I wake up in the dark every morning.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.000]   That's because you're a farm lad and you have to milk the cows, right? Well, there's that.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.400]   You grew up, I think that way, didn't you? I didn't milk any cows. No, I don't know how to milk
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:43.680]   cows. Did you? I know how to do a combine. I did drive a combine once. Yeah, once. Well,
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.680]   mostly I didn't do the I didn't do a lot of the the combine. Did you do chores at all, Alex?
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:52.880]   No, I'd load it. I so August was explains a lot. Wait a minute. No, I worked on the farms all
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:17:00.640]   summer and and I spent a lot of time in horse stalls. Mucking the barn. Yes. Every night we had 11
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.360]   horses. We had 11. Well, there you go. No, we we have the horses and like a dozen cows. See,
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.480]   Alex and I have something in common. Yeah, there are boys here. Yeah.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.440]   Did you did you wake up in the morning early morning is dark and you had to break the ice on
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:19.120]   the wash bowl and the what? No, yeah, no, no. So when the water froze in the in the barn,
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.880]   I would have to take a sled and put put get one gallon jugs on there, six of them and fill
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.320]   up with water and take them off to give the water to the horses and then do the back and forth in
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:33.360]   the middle of the night. In two ways, uphill, uphill. No, it wasn't it wasn't uphill. It was just
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.080]   a long it was just over gravel. At the end of September, the same thing happened in New Zealand
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:43.520]   in Australia. Alarms went off one hour early because they were switching to summertime.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.440]   Apple representatives contacted on Monday did not say when the issue will be fixed.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:54.960]   We will be finding out this Sunday just a word of warning and if I'm an hour late for the show,
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:59.120]   I just want to know that if anyone if anyone if any of our elected officials are people running
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.160]   for election, they were gonna know if they said they were gonna get rid of it, I would have voted
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:07.280]   for didn't didn't I think president Obama kept one of his camp one of at one point mentioned he
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:11.520]   didn't like it either. That's why I voted for him. Did he do it? Arizona my parents live in Arizona.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:18.080]   I know they seem fine. Sanity and there's a lot of Africa has it. The reason they did that is
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:24.240]   because there was a guy who who ran a drive in movie theaters in Arizona and he was he wanted it
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:28.560]   to be dark later so we could get it an extra showing and to this day Arizona doesn't happen,
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.600]   which I think is awesome. The only thing about it is that you can't figure out what time it is
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.560]   in Arizona when you're in California because you're like I can't do that in my head. I know the time
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:39.520]   of the year is it is it. Are they always they just remain stable and we but what are they stable
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:44.400]   compared to us? I don't know which one there's there's stay there so half the year they are in
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:48.480]   Pacific time and the other half of the year they are in mountain time. There's your problem right
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.560]   there but if we all just regained our sanity we would not have to deal with this at all. So when
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.520]   president Obama was elected he said he wanted to get rid of daylight savings time to conserve energy
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:05.360]   however a study says there is little scientific proof of this resolution's energy consumption
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:10.080]   also turns out this practice could be wasteful. How about we just reduce confusion? I know let's
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.640]   let's conserve sanity. You know we had a whole march on the level. There's so little of it. I know we need
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:20.400]   to conserve it. Let's conserve sanity. In fact in Indiana which did not observe daylight savings
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:26.960]   time until very recently. Overall increase of 1% in residential electricity used when they went to
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:32.080]   daylight savings time and occasional increases of 2% to 4% in late spring and early fall so in fact
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:38.160]   it's wasting energy. You can't use Indiana as an example. They have different counties have
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.280]   different time zones in Indiana. I think it's fine. I think that it's fine that or save the
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.760]   energy. I just want I just want to have the clock stay the same. That's all you know I just don't
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.360]   I'm tired. I mean just we just need to. Well I think Apple feels about the same way we're
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:55.360]   gonna bet that too. Obviously the guy who writes the clock app is not let out and he is not allowed
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:03.840]   to travel. Yeah. Stays inside. Apple had a very good quarter in smartphone sales finally besting
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:11.920]   Blackberry from RIM with 26% of the smartphone sales in the US in the quarter RIM down to 24%
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:18.800]   Microsoft down from 9% to 3%. Now some of that's because they're going to come out with a new
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.920]   smartphone in about a week and I'm sure that's going to go like gangbusters and the number one
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:30.160]   smartphone of course Android with compared to Apple's 26% you want to take a guess what the
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:38.800]   Android had. 40. Was it 44? 44% yeah. Almost. I believe the iPhone 4 was the number one
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.960]   handset but there are so many Android handsets that's the problem right. Right.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.840]   Exactly. That's kind of telling because if there were just one Android handset it would have
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:53.280]   outsold Android but because there's so many of them. Android. Android. I like that. Andy Android.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:21:00.480]   Where's Nokia on this list? Well worldwide there's still number one right. Yeah for now.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:06.400]   It's not going to go well. In Q3 2010 the worldwide smartphone market grew to an
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:14.000]   an impressive 95% of the same quarter of a year ago almost doubled to 80.9 million shipped units.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.320]   Nokia had one third share 33% of the market worldwide. Apple 17% a little bit ahead of
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:27.280]   rim worldwide as well which was 15% of course Apple beat finally ousted rim in the US with
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.560]   its 26%. I think didn't we didn't we find out last week that Apple is now the number four
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:39.120]   handset maker in the world that by units which is not smartphones but just phones just because
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.680]   they're shipping so many iPhones or at least shipped so many iPhone 4s. Worldwide. Yeah.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.920]   Yeah it's a lot of good numbers for the company that you know was told you can't just walk right
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:53.920]   in and sell a phone. That's pretty amazing. I mean Android's got a lot of platform momentum but
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.760]   Apple it's kind of remember where they were I mean what four years ago they were nowhere.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:02.960]   Yeah it's pretty amazing. Pretty much so zero to four in three or four years.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:08.880]   So Nokia this is worldwide shipments of smartphones actually of all mobile phones it looks like.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:17.280]   Doesn't say smartphones. Top five mobile phone vendors in third quarter 2010 110 million phones
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:26.320]   in three months for Nokia. 71 million for Samsung LG 28 million then Apple 14 million then rim 12
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.040]   million. So that's of all phones. So that's pretty good number four handset manufacturer.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:36.480]   Crazy. That's amazing really. I remember back in the day when the iPod was number or the
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.560]   iTunes store was number four. You know we were talked about it. I think in many ways you can
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:46.240]   credit Apple with the creation of a smartphone market. I mean Nokia really dominated that small
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:50.880]   market. The problem was the old smartphones just weren't very smart. They weren't that smart.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:55.280]   They were pretty stupid. I remember my N95. It was like well it was I remember having this
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:59.920]   conversation with a friend of mine. It was like I you know I hate my trio. Like I had a trio before
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:04.320]   my iPhone. I hated my trio. I just hated everything else more. You know it was like that was the
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:08.320]   whole thing is I just hate everything else more than my trio and and the iPhone was the first one
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:14.240]   that I actually. My trio I used to say oh do I need to take my phone with me when I'm going out.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:20.480]   And the iPhone is like oh I get to take the iPhone with me. I don't even I don't even like I
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:24.080]   just don't go anywhere. I mean like I don't I don't. Hey at least bring your iPod. I'm not swimming
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:28.000]   with it but that's about with you. A police in Delaware are still trying to track down a creep
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.200]   who tried to lure a 12 year old into his van as she waited to be picked up outside the Stanton
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:37.760]   middle school. She told police a man in a white van pulled into the school driver driveway and said
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:44.560]   get in the van. That's when she whipped out her iPod touch and put it up to her ear as if she
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:52.080]   were making a phone call a man sped off. Just keep something with you. Yeah. Even if it's just an iPod
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:58.480]   touch. Yeah those guys are those guys are going to they can't tell. They don't know. Right. So it's
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:05.040]   right. I'm smart. Really smart. Really smart. Nice. Happy story. Netbook demand. According to
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:11.280]   apple insider.com tumbling as 80% of tablet buyers want iPads new survey
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:19.440]   of from change wave 3000 customers interviewed asked about devices they plan to buy in the next
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:26.160]   90 days results show that 14% of laptop buyers looking at a netbook. That's 10% below the peak in
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:35.440]   June 2009. However. A lot of them. Let me see if I can find the actual numbers are now looking at
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:41.680]   tablets. I think again when we look at the the use of an average user. Someone who's working
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.000]   in business. Someone who's working in school and how they're using their their devices. I think
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.760]   the tablets in general and the and the iPad specifically at the moment. I think the iPad right
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:55.680]   now is 94% of sales on tablets is you know that's just a great answer for a lot of people. Those
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:05.520]   polled 80% 80 80 0. So they're most likely to purchase an iPad 8% the playbook 3% the galaxy tab.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:10.400]   I'm surprised that rims playbook has such top of mind awareness 8% a lot higher than the
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.480]   lot of lack of fans out there. I've talked to people who say the same thing that they're like
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:18.480]   doesn't even exist. No, it doesn't exist. But that's good marketing and that that's some brand
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.600]   loyalty there. And I totally understand that. But you look at those numbers and you think a lot
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.040]   of people who wanted who were interested in buying a netbook what they wanted is like
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.360]   a computer to leave on their on their living room coffee table to look up things on IMDB or
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:36.640]   whatever and that that stuff you don't need a computer for. Yep. Larry and Sergey said that
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.960]   when they were starting to look for a CEO for Google they thought about Steve Jobs. Steve had
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:46.560]   already returned to Apple I think at that time. So that was a pipe dream. I don't think Steve
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:51.600]   would have even considered it. Would Steve Jobs have been better for Google than Eric Schmidt? I
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.760]   don't think so. There's no product there. What is the product? That wouldn't have worked.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:03.120]   Wouldn't have worked. No. Steve, I mean, for whatever you think of Steve and of course I think
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:09.120]   most people admire him greatly and accepting that he's not a perfect human. He is a flawed human
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.600]   but admire him greatly. But whatever you think about him he's a product guy first and foremost.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.440]   I mean he's all about the hardware, right? Well, and all about complete control of the hardware
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.480]   and how it's going to come out and what it's going to look like and that has done real well
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.800]   for Apple. I mean, I think that Steve, his dream job is what he's doing. We're coming back to the
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:31.520]   company that kicked him out and being able to show that he was right. We will have a, we'll take a
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:37.200]   little Sesame Street break and then our picks of the week coming up Alex Lindsey is here.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:46.880]   So is Jason Snell from Macworld Magazine and apparently so are Elmo and his friends from Sesame
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:57.120]   Street. There's an app for that. Hit it guys. Yes, my friends. The iPogo can do anything. Anything?
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:05.280]   If you want to comb your cat, there's an app for that. If you have to fix a flat,
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.680]   there's an app for that. Need a word that rhymes with that.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.480]   Or a place to hang your hat. Got a chimp who likes to chat.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:23.680]   There's an app. There's an app. There's an app. You got to love how Sesame Street has stayed up
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:30.000]   with the times, right? I mean, they just, but you know, they're speaking to kids like Malachi,
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:36.080]   your son. He loves Sesame Street and he knows about apps. He uses an iPad. He knows a lot about
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:40.560]   apps. It speaks to him as much as it does to adults. Yeah, he's, you know, it's surprising. I thought
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:45.680]   that he would just watch movies on it, you know, on his iPad and with my old iPad, I had a Wi-Fi
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:50.080]   one that I gave him. And the thing that he uses the most is loop, loop, site, loop,
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:58.400]   seg. I don't even know what that is. It's this, I mean, literally, it makes me almost insane.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:04.960]   He uses it. Is it a game? Yeah, it's annoying sounds. What it is, is if you, let me turn this up a little bit.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:11.200]   So you would find the most annoying sound thing. Right. So what it does is you can actually set
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.680]   up pretty, you know, it's like a synthesizer and you can, you know, set up. Oh, no wonder. That's
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:21.280]   cool. And of course, what he does is just, he makes designs on the sequencer. Hey, don't knock
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:27.840]   it. I interviewed Brian Eno and he was the king of like the, the Roland or the emu or something.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:32.880]   And he said, you know, I'm an art student. I'm not a musician. I just drew designs and the music
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.640]   followed. Right. And so that's so what he does is does. And this is actually a really
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:41.360]   commercial. Don't knock it. Yeah. And so one more video before we get to our picks of the week,
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.320]   this could be your pick if you want it to be. I'm trying to, can you stop it?
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:52.320]   This is the geekiest marriage proposal ever from Mac Gaz and this is on YouTube.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:58.880]   Watch and learn. Frank has been in love with his girlfriend, Casey, for many years. On October
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.680]   24th, he decided to finally pop the question. He planted surprise proposal in Central Park.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.920]   His tech savvy friends helped him pull it off, hidden cameras and special iPhone apps for you.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:16.240]   So there's Casey, Frank's girlfriend. There's Nadia, the accomplice. And they're all videoing this.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:24.720]   Camera A, camera B, C, there's Frank. He's getting in a rowboat. He's rolling out to the center of
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:31.600]   the lake in Central Park. Their cameras everywhere. Poor Casey has no idea what's going on.
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.600]   I'm standing by. I'm in position. All right. Go ahead and make the call.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:41.840]   Okay. A band now is coming out on the bridge. Casey's starting to wonder what's going on.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.160]   She doesn't know her Frank is involved. Okay. The band's go.
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:57.440]   Casey's looking around. She's just puzzled but doesn't yet know what's about to happen.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:10.640]   It's Casey's favorite song. She's singing along. She's digging it.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:16.800]   Her boyfriend, meanwhile, under the bridge in a rowboat. She can't sing.
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:23.600]   I'm a good band.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:31.200]   Now they've got four cameras. So we're seeing this from every angle. This is a multi-camera shoot
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:40.960]   and they're all iPhones. She's singing along. She's digging it.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:48.400]   [Music]
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:56.560]   All right. Come on now. Now he's rowing out from under the bridge. He's right behind Casey.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:03.360]   [Music]
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.360]   Hey, see you down here.
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:08.400]   [Music]
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:15.440]   Hi. It's been two years. I don't want to wait anymore. I'm afraid I'm going to fall in the water.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.440]   Are you married? Yes! Yes! Yes!
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:31.840]   That's a pretty happy feeling to say. Okay. I'm getting tears in my eyes. You threw the ring up.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:37.760]   She catches it in the crown of the bridge applauds. Meanwhile, all the friends are crying but they've
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:42.880]   got it all on video. I was pretty gutsy to throw it up. I'm...
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:48.800]   Isn't that about the sweetest thing you ever saw? She's running down to it. He's rowing in.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.240]   Okay. That's pretty cute. Now they're rowing out together.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:59.600]   And it's all on YouTube for everybody to see. That is...
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:06.000]   It's getting a little dusty in here. That's kind of beautiful. Isn't that sweet? That's great.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.600]   And I love it that they got all their friends out there with iPhones.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:14.000]   iPhones to take it. I'm like, I want that app. Yeah, did you see?
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.960]   You were really looking at some app? Yeah, I was like, it was... I wonder what the app was.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   I know. That was pretty impressive. It's custom apps. Oh, it's fake. Someone said it's fake.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:25.920]   It's fake. You think it's one of them commercials? Oh, please say it's not a commercial.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:29.040]   Was the Tom and Tom the band playing there? Yeah, maybe.
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:34.080]   Maybe. I just thought it was up. God, I fall from every time. No, that was great. Come on.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:39.040]   Even if it was inspiring. Hey, let's take a break. Come back with our picks of the week
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:42.800]   before we do though. I want to mention our friends at audible.com. A great place to go.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.680]   If you are looking to listen, yeah, I know you listen to podcasts.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:51.360]   Wouldn't you like to listen to reading now? Oh, man, I am in the Gunslinger.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:56.640]   The seven books of the Gov. Stephen King's Gunslinger saga. There's so many. Here's...
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:04.000]   They call me Baba Buigari Del Bade's biography of Baba Bui himself. Howard Stern's show producer.
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:09.280]   I'm listening to a thousand hills. A thousand hills? It's what's that about?
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:12.000]   It's really good. It's really hard to listen to at times, but you know, it's about...
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.600]   So I'm doing all this work in Rwanda. So I'm reading all these books or listening to all
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:21.600]   these books on Rwanda. And this one's about Paul Kagami and, you know, coming to the whole
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:26.800]   process. But it's really... Wow. But here's the thing is that it is the stuff of movies. I mean,
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:30.400]   you know, so it is like what happened, you know, where they basically...
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.280]   You know, he spent his whole life in Uganda and they literally built an army inside of the
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:40.000]   Ugandan army of all these extra... All these Rwandans. And then there was just one day where
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.960]   everyone was in the UN or whatever in New York and one of the generals, the Rwandan general,
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:50.960]   just sent all the Rwandan Ugandan force to the southern border and invaded.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:56.800]   Oh, please. I mean, to revolt against the thing. And it was... But it was just a... It is...
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:00.480]   But it's like a Jason Bourne kind of thing because now Kagami's done. It's true.
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.760]   It's all true. And it's all... You know, and I got to say, what's interesting is the audio
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.520]   quality isn't very good. It sounds like there's two different... You know, it's not the quality of
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:13.040]   the audio book, but I just find myself riveted by this story of how this is all happening.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:16.800]   Anyway, it's... What's it called? It's called "A Thousand Hills."
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.640]   "A Thousand Hills." And it's what I'm... You know, and it's...
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:19.600]   And I found...
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:23.120]   Four chocolate wars. The 150-year rivalry between the world's greatest chocolate.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:27.040]   A little lighter. See, you can listen, you know, real war or chocolate wars.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.760]   It's your choice. You can really, you know, go either way. You know, but...
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:32.480]   But, you know, the thing is, is that, you know, what was funny is I had to drive
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.400]   last week back and forth because I was taking this class with a big new ranch in San Francisco.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.360]   So you had a lot of driving.
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.760]   And I had a lot of driving. And I was like, I was looking forward to it.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.480]   Every day, I was like, "Oh, I get to listen to another hour and a half of the book."
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:46.480]   Oh, I do too. I drive... I now drive my kid to school just because I want to listen.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:46.960]   Right.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.560]   If I can get an hour a day listening and I'm really happy, you used to get two hours with a commute.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.880]   This is an INVU if you have a long commute. How about this one? You had me at WOOF.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:57.520]   How dogs taught me the secrets of happiness.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:02.560]   There's something for everybody. Fiction, nonfiction, history. I listen to a lot of history.
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:06.880]   And I really enjoy that science fiction. Look, there's something new in the Wheel of Time series.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:11.760]   There's all sorts of stuff here. Audible. 75,000 books.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:15.920]   And I'm going to give you your first one. Absolutely free. I've been really tempted to get the
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:23.280]   the Baroque cycle. Quicksilver is the first book of the Baroque cycle, but they have all three of them.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.840]   King of the Vagabons and Odellesk, which these are Neil Stevenson's
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.080]   completely opaque novels that I've been dying to read, but I can't get through them.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:37.680]   But see, sometimes with an audiobook, you can listen to a book that you couldn't read otherwise.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:43.200]   My father listens to Audible.com constantly. And he's listening to, I guess, the girl with the
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:47.680]   Dragon Tet. Oh, those are great. Totally. Yes. You know, into it.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.000]   If you haven't read the Millennium Saga, listen. And don't go see the movie until you've listened
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.240]   to it on Audible. Audible is like a movie in your mind. I really find that because I'm listening
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.480]   something, there's some sort of different brain processing. And I actually have a strong visual
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.480]   connection with what I'm listening to. And sometimes I'll see a movie and I'll go, wait a minute. I
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:08.880]   Oh, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I read that. There's just something in there. You've got to try

[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:43.520]   which book. I love, you know, you see I'm at credits zero. I've expired and I'm just waiting
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:48.720]   because my next book is going to be the Keith Richards autobiography life. I've really moved
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.480]   my whole my whole like now when I buy if I'm buying a book that I'm going to read, it's usually a
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.160]   technical manual and it's on Kindle. Right. It's on either my Kindle or the book I book
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:59.280]   story mostly Kindle because it's a lot of art available on the I book store but the
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.440]   or I'm listening to an audible but there's not a lot in between anymore. I mean, I can't wait to
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:08.080]   listen to this one Johnny Depp narrates Keith Richards life. Oh yeah. You got it. I mean that's
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.520]   one you're not going to be able to put down. Is that not awesome? That was such a great idea
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:19.040]   whoever thought of that. No, it's brilliant. Gold star for you. Anyway, you get the idea. Audible.com/macbrae
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:24.320]   your first one's free. You can tell I think by now that we're all audible fanatics.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:29.920]   We cannot get enough audible time for our picks of the week. Jason, I'll let you start. Gosh,
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.080]   you probably see every piece of hardware and software out there. What's your favorite these days?
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:38.080]   Oh, well, I'm going to I'm going to go with the 11 inch MacBook Air. I think that's the only
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:43.680]   only the right thing to do. I got it right here. I'm a I don't do a lot of audio books because I'm
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.880]   a bus commuter. I bus in from Marin County and to down in San Francisco. So this thing
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.400]   actually fits. I can open it up in the bus seat and I can type, which I can't do with the iPad.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:00.640]   I like it better than the 13 the 13 air is nice, but the 11 that that super small size and the
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:06.640]   full size keyboard, you know, I it's it's the most interesting laptop apples made in a long time.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:12.000]   I'm really happy with it. I think that it's the SSD makes it fast. So the flash storage in it.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.240]   It's it's even though it's got a slow processor. It's got good graphics card and it's got the fast
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:21.040]   storage and that sort of compensates if you're editing hi to video, it's probably not for you.
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:25.440]   But if you're writing and doing email and stuff like that, great little system super light,
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:31.360]   easy to carry around. And then in the in the genre of of kids games on the iPad,
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.240]   my kids love cookie doodle cookie doodle. See cookie doodle and cake doodle,
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.640]   where you basically touch on the screen and you roll out your dough and then you choose cookie
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:45.520]   cutters and then you decorate them and then you eat them all on the screen. It's hilarious.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:53.040]   And my kids cannot get enough of cookie doodle and cake doodle. It's free. No, it's 99 cents.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.520]   Yeah, looks awesome. And you ever even get a recipe if you want to make the cookies?
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.520]   It's yeah. Yeah, you get a recipe and you can roll out the dough and it's got different shapes
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.000]   and the cake you can choose the layers and you can put on all the frosting and I don't even know
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.640]   where my wife heard about it from somebody and my kids are obsessed with cookie doodle and cake
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:17.520]   doodle and it's slow fat. It is zero calories. You cannot get fat on cookie doodle.
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:20.480]   My son plays one and I can't even remember the name of it. I think I downloaded randomly.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:24.080]   That's Jello like you build Jello and then you put little treats in the Jello and then it bounces
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:29.360]   around your iPad and you can you can bend it and push it and that's the other I have to say. I mean,
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.440]   it's in hindsight, it's obvious, but the kid market for touch. Oh, it's incredible. Yeah, I mean,
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.560]   it's just he's just completely fluid. And my daughter who's only a year and a half has already
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:46.400]   she fights with him over the iPhone. You know, she wants the I will second Jason's
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:52.880]   vote for the MacBook Air. In fact, Dvorak was here for Twit and he poo pooed the whole thing
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.720]   until he and then I said, well, why don't you use it for the show and he almost stole it.
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:02.400]   He he said, this thing is really fast. I said, yeah, it's amazing. SSD makes a huge difference.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:07.040]   He says it's really light. It's really he fell in love with it. He said, and I think this may be
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.760]   the case for me. It's the best laptop notebook of any kind I've ever used. I'm resisting.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:17.120]   I'm resisting the I love it. The temptation part. It's it's really good. I mean, I got
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:22.160]   talked out of giving it five mice out of five by my lab director. Oh, while I was in a moment of
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.480]   weakness and I hadn't slept and the Giants were in the playoffs and I was very confused. And he
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.320]   said, you know, there's probably going to be one with a little bit better processor at some point.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:33.920]   I'd say that ultimate edition. I don't know the 999. I don't think you need to get them.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.880]   I don't even think you need a 99 such a great deal if you've got I mean, don't make it your main
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:44.800]   system. But I mean, wow, I depends what you it depends what you do. But if you are a writer for a
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:49.040]   magazine, it could be your main system. It could it could be and it'll even drive a big external
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.680]   monitor and I'm doing I'm doing national novel writing month. This was a nano mama.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:41:00.000]   And oh, and oh, Rimo.org. And I'm writing to do that to write 50,000 words in 30 days. I am
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.880]   doing some on my commute on the bus and on my old 13 inch Apple laptop. It was going to be really
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:10.160]   hard to do it. And I've got the 11 MacBook Air now and it's it's coming. I wrote a couple of
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.400]   passwords this morning. It's the sports car of of computers. It's just fantastic.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:19.520]   Fast but you know, but fast enough. I mean, you don't find it. I don't wait for it. I'm not waiting.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.960]   It won best to launch anything. I'm not waiting for the sports car analogy.
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:28.320]   It's more like the Mazda MX three. Yeah, it's a rotary. It's a wankle, but it's okay. So,
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:33.200]   are you using Scribner for a nano Rimo? I am using Scribner. Scribner to just
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:38.320]   came out on Monday. That came out. Yeah, on Monday and it is great from literature and latte,
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:43.360]   literature and latte.com. Great writing software with lots of organizational features. And I know
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.600]   Andy and I co I introduced it to him. I'm going to claim to fame and he loves it and writes all his
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:51.760]   columns and that now and it's it's really good. It's Andy's honorary pick. He's not with us, but I
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.880]   know if he were here, he would be picking Scribner to go came out on Monday. It is a $25 upgrade
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:01.840]   for you Scribner users. I paid for it immediately. And if you do nano Rimo and you win, you get,
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:07.680]   I believe 50% off. You're a winner. So yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, he's a big supporter. I know
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:12.880]   of nano Rimo Alex, your pick of the week. So should I talk about this anything you want? Okay,
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:17.200]   I'm gonna talk about two things. He's when he says this, he's pointing at a stuffed animal.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:24.000]   Okay, this is the Leo gave me this to test. I gave him an assignment. I had an assignment,
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:31.120]   which was to take this Wookiee. This is called a movie. It's from Griffin and take it home and
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:37.920]   have it kid tested and in parent approved. And so I took it home and I have to admit that I just
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:43.280]   think it was really going to work. And my son is obsessed with it. It was actually a little bit
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:47.280]   of a challenge to I had to sneak in and steal it to bring it over to the show and I'm going to
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:51.600]   bring it right back before he goes. This is gone. He loves this thing. And as a parent,
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.160]   my thing is that I like putting my iPad in something that my three and a half year old can throw.
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:00.000]   The problem is he's gotten into the habit of I give him the iPhone and I tell him I want it back.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.240]   He just looks at me with a flat face and just goes and just throws it at you like if you want
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.120]   it, I'll throw it at you. And he knows that he's going to get a reaction. And so now he can throw
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:10.880]   this and I don't I'm not too worried about the he hasn't killed the phone yet. This is my old
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:17.200]   iPhone. And he just loves it. He and even if I take the iPhone out, he wants it in his bed when
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.760]   he goes to bed. Like he wants it as his like pillow. This has become like his his new little friend.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:25.840]   And so while I thought that it was silly, he doesn't call it a wooky. He calls it the octopus.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.280]   But and now it has a little Jack. So you got a little speaker. And then you can squeeze the
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:36.000]   arms or something. I mean, is there no? It's just that it's a big sack. It just holds arms that holds
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.840]   it that you know, it has a sesame street game, but the sesame street game is kind of like a
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:43.920]   it's like a cheap game that then wants to upgrade you to other stories. And I was like that the
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:47.840]   game itself. But it doesn't matter. He just plays with he just plays with the iPhone. I mean, he doesn't
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:52.800]   do anything with it other than just does iPhone apps and the and the touch touching through the
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:59.200]   plastic works totally fine. And so so he as I said, he loves it. It keeps the iPhone dry,
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:06.320]   not too messy and in one piece. And and it's just it's only 20 bucks. I mean, it's 20 bucks. It's a
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.240]   great little thing. Don't bother with the application, the sesame street application. I mean, it's cute,
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:14.400]   but it's kind of like a low grade doctor suits. I mean, the doctor shoe stuff is done so well,
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:18.480]   that either you do it that well or don't bother as far as I'm concerned, kid stuff,
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:22.000]   you know, hire whatever companies doing that and just do it that way. Because it's just
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.640]   totally tight. And so I don't find that to be particularly useful. But I do think that the I
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:29.760]   wish that the I'm a little concerned when it runs out of batteries that it's going to be a pain to
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:34.880]   change the batteries in it, you know, for the speaker. But outside of that, it's great. So
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:38.560]   Wookie, that's my my my pick now the now the more adult pit.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:44.000]   I was showing you this earlier. That is it. This is sweet. But this is this is audio
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.480]   production of some kind. This is and I and I, you know, it's here's the deal. I've been laying
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:52.560]   off on people. I've been doing lots of free picks and less expensive picks. And this is the kind of
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:58.240]   thing that I really just get super excited about. So this is sound device. So sound devices is we
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:04.000]   almost all the equipment we buy when we do audio, almost all the equipment we buy is sound devices,
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.400]   because two two reasons. One is the preamps are just gorgeous compared to the crud that most of
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:15.600]   these things have really, really warm preamps that just make mics sound better. Secondly,
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:20.400]   they have a limiter in it that is that is just just short of unclippable. I mean, you can you can
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.920]   clip the mic, but you're not going to clip this interface. And how many times have we dealt with
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:27.040]   you turn it up a little too high. And now you're clipping everything going into your recording
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.680]   when you're trying to do a voiceover. It's pretty good. It's pretty good. Meters on it too. So
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.000]   you're high resolution meters. You can you have a lot of control. So the idea is you plug you
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.560]   plug XLR mics or analog audio right into this. It turns it into USB or digital. So you could have
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:46.080]   you can actually have digital out. You can do digital out. Those are analog out. So you can just
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:52.800]   use it to to as a preamp for a mic preamp as a mic. But you also connect it to your laptop
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:58.400]   USB. And now you've got two mics. It's a little mini mixer. You can also have a mic and regular
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:02.960]   audio too. Yeah. So the other thing you can use this for is it'll take USB power too. So you can
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:08.560]   just plug a USB you can just plug it into power. Well, if you if you have you have USB power, but
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.640]   right, but you don't need another power supply. So so now what you can do is use that as your preamp
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:18.480]   to or or or just a mixer right for two for two minutes to mics. And it's not a mixer. I got to
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:23.440]   tell you, I mean there you don't get it until you start using really good preamps of how big of a
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:30.240]   deal these things are. And it is and then you have and the thing about sounds. I have walks out. So
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:35.440]   if for instance, you could use this instead of a beach deck for a camera, right? You could
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:42.960]   connect XLR mics and run them into the cameras mini jack. If you have a Canon 5D Mark II for
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:46.560]   instance, if that's all you were doing, then you would use they have a mobile pre that does
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:50.720]   that just it's just designed to do that kind of thing. This one this one is kind of like does
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.160]   a lot of what the mobile pre does. It's a little bit bigger and it gives you the big thing is it
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:58.080]   gives you this great USB interface. So this is like the Cadillac of USB interface. It is it's
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:03.760]   priced like the Cadillac. It's I think it's I believe I want to say it's $650. But you know,
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.800]   that sounds like a lot but a good A to D converter. Oh man. It is is going to be that
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:14.000]   one. It's solid. I mean, I mean, the thing is this is like this is this is well. Sound devices is the
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.720]   Mac of sound equipment. You know, so if you're looking for super high quality, well built,
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:23.040]   everything, you know, it's actually made in the US. I mean, they make them all, you know, the,
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:29.120]   and it is super high quality. They sent me, they sent me that to take a test and I'm not giving
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:34.000]   it back. John's gonna have a search in right now for it. I think I might want to this too.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.600]   Just for field recording. Well, yeah. Well, for field recording, then you move into a whole,
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:40.160]   if you want to do it through your laptop, of course, once you get the sound devices,
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:44.160]   you're going to see things like the 702 T the 744 T we have a 788 T.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.520]   Combine this with a MacBook Air and you've got a nice little podcast setup or?
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:56.480]   Well, yeah. And that's, you know, we absolutely what we use for on the road. Now,
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.400]   this is you say this is studio only. This is not a mobile. Well, no, you can take it. You
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.080]   definitely take it on the road. It weighs as much as a minute. You definitely, if you want the
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:08.480]   highest quality audio going into your Mac to do your online stuff on the road, this is it.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:12.000]   This is the highest quality you're going to find. I haven't said of an M audio or something.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.920]   Yeah. Well, and the thing is, is that once you get used to good preamps, you listen to everything
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:18.960]   else, you plug it into all the other thing, you're like, you know, it's just, it's just, you know,
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:24.000]   and, and you just have all the control that you want. You have, you know, it's just the, the
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.680]   headphone jack is like, I mean, the headphone outputs are really good. You have tons of control.
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.280]   You saw the control over the dip switches on the bottom. Yeah. I mean, they have packed as much as
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:36.800]   you can possibly pack into this little square. So if, you know, if you really want a bar none best
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:43.920]   solution to interface with your computer, I think the USB pre is two is the, is the one to go for,
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:49.600]   you know, and, and we just, we were really sold on, we, as said, we have a 552 and a 788T and a
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:54.400]   702T and, you know, we were kind of, we've drunk, you know, the, the Kool-Aid, the sound device is
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:59.280]   Kool-Aid, but it, we just haven't found anything else to be in the same ballpark for what we do.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:06.160]   The, the 788T, which is much more expensive, but it's what we use in, in the field. That takes eight
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:12.400]   XLR-ins. Yeah. It is, it is the finest piece of audio equipment ever made as far as I'm concerned.
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.400]   I mean, it is. So that's a, that's a different level. I'm kind of sad that I do so much, that
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:20.320]   everything I do now has to have video because it's so much easier to really do a great audio show
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:24.000]   in the field. Yeah. Then now I've, you know, if I want to do cameras and, well, I got to tell you
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.080]   what we're doing. So when we do, when we do video though, we still have the 788T because I can
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:32.240]   reroute all of the, I can take my inputs and then reroute them to any output that I want.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:37.280]   I use it as the in-between. That's how we kind of control all of our audio. That's our portable
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.800]   mixer is the, is the 788T. But the, as I said, the mobile, the USB mobile pre, if you're looking for,
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.200]   you know, the bar none, I want the best interface. I just haven't seen anything else like it. And
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:52.160]   I have almost all of them. Like I have, I have the sure, I have the centrance, I have the,
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:58.000]   the M audios, I have the M boxes, I have the, you know, I have just about all of the ones that
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.400]   you can get because I'm constantly, this is something we deal with constantly. And, and this is
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:07.280]   awesome. So anyway, that's, that's all I have to say. Good recommendation. Thank you, Alex Lindsey.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:13.280]   I kind of have already mentioned one of my picks, but I'll, I'll give you another one. And it's not
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:17.840]   really a pick, but just to get your awareness up, I was going to mention the Scrivener two has come
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:25.200]   out. Sophos has announced and has released a free antivirus for the Mac. Now, I still don't think
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:32.400]   you need an antivirus for the Mac yet, but Sophos is a great company. They make, you know,
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:36.400]   very high-end security solutions. And if you feel like you want an antivirus for the Mac,
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:41.600]   I can't see any reason to buy a Norton or an Tigo solution when you can get something from Sophos.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:48.000]   So if you do want an antivirus for the Mac, I don't think really there's a lot going on with the Mac
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.480]   world yet. Although we do know there are holes, there are exploits. I think it's, we're now at this
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:58.320]   point, we're being protected merely because we're such a small percentage of the total user universe
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:04.000]   might not be a bad idea to download this. Haven't used it yet. Can't, I'm not really recommending it,
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.040]   just pointing it out. It's out, came out today and it's free. Do you, Jason, does Mac
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:13.520]   will make a recommendation for an antivirus for a? We go back and forth. You know, I think the,
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:18.560]   you know, we've tested a lot of them. It's very hard because if you don't have a virus in the
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:23.680]   wild, you can't test it. You're really, you install it hoping that it'll catch the next virus when it
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:28.720]   comes. I got to be honest, I don't, I don't either. I don't run anything. I did turn off the
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:34.080]   auto open items in Safari. Checkbox for sure. So that you know where you're getting it from,
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:38.320]   and you're saying, yes, I do want to open it. But beyond that, you know, I think for most people,
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:43.920]   it's, it's an extra layer of security, which is great, but I don't personally, you know, run any
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:47.760]   of it. If it weren't Sophos, I would, you know, I mean, this, I would probably not mention it,
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:49.840]   but they are really a great company. They do good stuff.
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:54.160]   Oh, there are a lot of good packages out there. It's just the question is, you know,
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:59.040]   how do you test it and when will you need it and will you ever need it? And you know, that's,
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:02.800]   it's always going to be the case that the Mac is going to be a smaller target and that if you
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:07.360]   really want to take out a large swath of people and turn them into your minions and do, you know,
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:11.040]   spamming and other things, you're going to use PCs because they're more of them.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:16.080]   I would say that the reason, the only reason you might worry on a Mac is for something called a
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:21.840]   spearfishing attack, which is a targeted attack. If, if for instance, your company uses Macs in the
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:25.840]   front office and a bad guy wants to attack your company and knows that, then they're going to
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:30.000]   attack the Mac directly with a spearfishing attack. But I think you're right. I don't think
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.600]   we're seeing general Mac viruses yet, wherever until, until Apple has a larger market share.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:38.320]   Well, the question is, does the iOS close some of that down as well?
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:44.720]   You know what we, I used to say that and there are so many known flaws and you see, you see,
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:50.080]   you know, that pwned-on contest every year in Canada and every year,
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:56.800]   apples are cracked first, usually through Safari. You know, it's just, it is, it is absolutely a
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:00.480]   vulnerable topic to a target. I don't think there's any question that's a vulnerable target. It's
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:06.000]   just merely a question of, you know, does anybody really want it? And it's so much easier to go after
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.320]   the 95% of the market. Sometimes I feel like that, that it must be secure because I have to give
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:16.640]   my password to my iPhone more than- Way too often. It's like a constant barrage of really,
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:19.600]   and I keep on feeling like I should change my password to make it simpler because it's so
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:23.520]   complicated. It's a heck of a hash and so it's like complicated. He said my, one of my sponsors
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:29.760]   on the radio show, actually, the sponsor is here too, is doing a testing a Mac antivirus as well,
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:34.320]   Cybersecurity for Mac. They're a good company. They would be another company worth looking at.
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:39.840]   But again, only until you feel like there's an issue. I just think it's, you know, if you're in
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:44.160]   a business or you're somebody that might be targeted, these spearfishing attacks are a little scary
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:50.560]   because what they are is they're targeted emails, sent at a company that the person wants to break
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:54.800]   into. And so in that case, you're just as vulnerable because if they know you're using Macs,
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:59.280]   they're going to go after you, you know, on the Mac platform. And there's certainly plenty of attacks.
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:01.680]   Right. Definitely if you have things that you're really concerned about.
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:04.320]   You know who you are if you're a target for spearfishing, I think.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:06.800]   Yeah. You know who you are.
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:10.160]   And you probably have somebody thinking about it. I know who you are. You're Jason Stell,
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:14.720]   Editor in Chief of Backworld Magazine. Thank you for being with us. It's always great to see you.
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:20.720]   It is always a pleasure, Leo. Anything you want to plug, you got plans for Macworld Expo, I'm sure.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:27.360]   And you have the end of January, macworld.com, iPad app, hopefully coming out in the next month or two.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:32.080]   We'll make that our pick of the week for sure. In fact, why don't you come on that week when you
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:37.360]   want to when that when you know it's coming out, let us know. That would be great. Macworld.com.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:42.000]   Thank you, Jason. Thank you. Go Giants. I guess we don't have to say go anywhere. They went. They
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:50.080]   went. They they cane. They saw. They want some but they went home. But I'll see you at the parade
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:56.880]   on Wednesday. Yes. I'll be there 11 a.m. Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel Core. Now here's the deal.
[01:54:56.880 --> 01:55:01.600]   Pixel Core.com is a place to go. If you'd like to know more about his guild of multimedia artists,
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:06.240]   who are learning and working together in Pixel Core.tv is a place to go for all those great podcasts.
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:08.720]   One of our members just moved is just moving to New Zealand.
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:12.560]   Oh, that's neat. It's going to work. That's yeah. What is like the company and with a
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:16.800]   Hobbit going into pre-pro? I imagine there's a pretty sight. A little bit to do down there.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:21.840]   Yeah, just a little bit. You have a you're going to rename Mac Breaker. You I don't know yet. I mean,
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:26.160]   we're just playing we're playing with you know how to brand things and everything else as we go
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:29.520]   into next year. So we haven't made a decision yet. Yeah. People have ideas that should send them
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:33.120]   to us. But yeah, but we're trying to think about you know, we're just thinking about the overall
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:36.880]   flow of everything right now. We are having by the way, Gear Media Tech is going to be covering
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:41.680]   AES. It's right next to us. I figured so AES is the big it's like the the big audio
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:49.120]   convention. All the engineering society. Yeah, sure directly. And so we're going to go over
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:54.000]   there and do our typical man on the street kind of wander around and and look at things that we
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.160]   think is cool. So that should be coming out sometime next week. I'll record a whole bunch of them
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:02.240]   this weekend. Pixel core TV to find out. Pick score TV. And what you're looking for is Gear Media Tech.
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:06.480]   It'll be on YouTube and pick score TV and iTunes. Oh, that makes it easy. Yeah, it's easy.
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:11.360]   It's all there. And your last thing was the SIGGRAPH, which was a must have been a long. We covered
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:16.640]   IBC as well. So IBC in that's the NAB of Europe. So we did a bunch of stuff in that's inside the
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:21.360]   black box. And and then the that you're seeing there. And but yeah, there's Gear Media Tech.
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:25.840]   Yeah, it's all there. And then yeah, and so there. And then the look for the big gear. And we covered
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:29.040]   IBC. So a whole bunch of cool stuff. We've gotten to the habit we used to
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:35.840]   break you with like 30 or 40 episodes because we record a lot of them really quickly. And and
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:41.280]   we've got so good. Well, now what we do is we we we we tie them up into three or four different
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:45.520]   little segments in one episode so that it's like all the things around mixers or all the
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.280]   things around. And here's the funny thing is now with Gear Media Tech, when I'm looking at buying
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:52.560]   stuff, I'm like, man, I'm pretty sure we covered that in NAB. I find myself referring back to
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:58.560]   our own videos. Very cool. Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Jason Snell. Thank you all for being here.
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:09.440]   Now get back to work. Break times over.
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:15.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
