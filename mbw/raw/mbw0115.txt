[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.040]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the time we take each week
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.200]   to sit back, relax, and bow to the altar of Steve on the phone
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.160]   with us via Skype, Mr. Scott Born from Gig Harbor.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.680]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.160]   Hello, Scott here.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.720]   Also on--
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.920]   Like well here in Gig Harbor.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.800]   Oh, they good?
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.680]   Oh, that's fine.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.960]   How's the yacht?
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.440]   The yacht is-- it's a wee bit under the weather.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.200]   Barnacles, you know.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.880]   Also here, Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.800]   Oh, la.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.440]   And--
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.280]   Can you try?
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.320]   Maybe Andy Inako will get a break away from his DMV
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.840]   health in time to join us.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.040]   We're hoping.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.600]   We're hoping.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.800]   So today on the agenda-- you know, this is one problem
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.320]   with doing a show only about Mac.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.480]   There's not always a lot of stuff.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.040]   This is our license to do a shorter show.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.440]   Shorter show.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.480]   No, we just talk longer about less.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.200]   So have you installed your Google voice search on your iPhone?
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.080]   I haven't installed it yet.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.280]   I was looking at it.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.960]   Shall I do it?
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.320]   Go ahead and give it a shot.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.840]   Now, I think you have to do dictionary searches.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.280]   So what should I search for?
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.600]   Gig Harbor?
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.480]   There you go.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   So--
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.680]   Geosynchronous.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.640]   It's smart enough to know when you put your geosynchronous.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.360]   When you put your phone up to your ear,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.920]   it seems to know that you're talking to it.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.040]   Gig Harbor is working.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   Oh, I did it.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.960]   I didn't wait long enough.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.000]   I'm going to do that again.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.640]   So, Gig Harbor.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.680]   Working, working, working.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.520]   I think there-- is there a human transcribing this?
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.760]   There is a some gig harbor.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.640]   It's now searching for Gig Harbor.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.680]   Gig Harbor's official visitor website.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.360]   So that's pretty cool that you can actually do that.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.160]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.200]   It's not officially on the Apple store.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.080]   You have to download it even though you already have it.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.920]   And it will update it for you.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.880]   Or do what I did.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.400]   I don't know over the air install where I just deleted it
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.240]   from my iPhone and then reinstalled it.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.160]   But is it interesting that Google did this before the Apple,
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.280]   long before it did it for--
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.000]   maybe not long, but before it did it for its Android
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.760]   operating system?
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.520]   You want to try it?
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.240]   I think that's the big format still.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.600]   And it's part of the deal.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.960]   So what you do is you put it up to your ear,
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.240]   and it's going to go, good ink.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.600]   And then you can say, but you've got to say dictionary word.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.920]   So you'll hear the good ink.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.040]   Geosynchronous.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.440]   He says--
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.040]   And then it does take a little while to do it.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.960]   Geosynchronous.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.720]   It did it.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.640]   It found geosynchronous.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.120]   There's got to be somebody typing that in.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.560]   I think there's somebody--
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.880]   See, if you do Alex Lindsey, they won't know what the heck it is.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.320]   No, wait, wait.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.080]   Hold on.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.040]   You hit search.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.040]   And then you just put it up here.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.080]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.480]   And then it shows the waveform, which is kind of cool.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.600]   And then it goes spin, spin, spin.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.000]   And it's kind of a cool waveform.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.840]   You know, I'm there.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.160]   You're there.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.920]   Wow.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   Let me try me.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.920]   Are you--
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.920]   Are they at the good point?
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   I think it.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.160]   Oh, I'm just having a wonderful time.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.320]   You guys just go ahead.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.640]   I'm sure our audience is pretty--
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.720]   Oh, it found me.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.720]   So this is good.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.520]   So if you're patient and you wait for the glink--
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.920]   It's faster than typing, though.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.720]   Don't you think that's-- well, it is on a phone?
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.400]   I wish that the-- you know, this is crazy, because it doesn't
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.320]   have voice dialing.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.560]   You know, the one thing that's really
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.720]   missing from the iPhone.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.120]   But it has voice searching.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.960]   Well, we know it works.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.720]   We know the voice--
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.120]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.000]   --the recognition works, though.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.960]   If I set my Google search to search the phone,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.280]   this would be close to it.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.840]   Look, it remembers all the previous searches, too.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.160]   All right.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.200]   So let me set the search to--
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.360]   yeah, I'm searching iPhone 1, but it just didn't--
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.680]   You think you could have it search for Mac news?
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.320]   Mac news.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.000]   Oh, now you made me tell it, this is Mac news.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.840]   The poor lady in India is going to go crazy.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.840]   I have to correct myself.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.400]   I said that Evernote had humans transcribing it.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.200]   Instead of this is Mac news, it got Office Max near low die.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.640]   That's-- that's darn close.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.120]   Office Max near low die.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.080]   Stuck in low die again.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.520]   Yeah, and an Office Max.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.920]   So I said that Evernote used human transcribers.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.840]   I thought it was using the Amazon Turk stuff, that kind of thing.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.040]   But apparently, that's done-- it is done by computer,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.640]   the text conversion in Evernote.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.600]   So I stand corrected.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.240]   They still-- Phil from Evernote sent me a note saying,
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.320]   no, no, we have a very smart algorithm.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   But who is now?
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.720]   Do you think this is Google is doing--
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.280]   because it's a little slow.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.240]   It must be sending back to the servers, the iPhones
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.240]   not doing the recognition.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.080]   Oh, well, it definitely has to be going back to the server.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.800]   So maybe that's why it's--
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.680]   It's very cool.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.640]   It's kind of talked to the main--
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.160]   that is the application of the week, for sure.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.320]   So in order to get it, it's not apparent.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.040]   If you look at the version number in the app store
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.760]   of the Google's local search-- what
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   they call it?
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.320]   Google search tool.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.840]   If you look for the Google search tool,
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.000]   it'll say the same version numbers is already on your phone,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.360]   but it isn't.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.120]   So they've jumped--
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.760]   Here's the thing.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.280]   I've been using text messaging, just using the Google text
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.440]   message searches.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.040]   And that works fine for me.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   Wouldn't it be cool?
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.680]   Yeah, but you don't have to type, see.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.760]   Would it be cool if you could send text messages that way
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.800]   if it would dictate-- allow dictation of text messaging?
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.960]   How long before that?
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   Well, I think it's a big difference between--
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.720]   Search terms.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.040]   Search terms and being able to understand what you're saying.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.120]   I can type faster than I can convince a thing
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.040]   to understand me.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.440]   You really?
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.480]   You can?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.400]   You're good.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.480]   I'm pretty quick on the iPhone now.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.120]   He's a kitten at the keys.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.000]   So Jerry Yang says, I'm quitting.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.360]   What's about day gone time?
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.840]   Finally.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.720]   Man, the final straw for me-- and I
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.120]   don't know what it was for the board,
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.440]   because he got to figure the board told him he's quitting.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.440]   The final straw for me was when he's at Web 2.0
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.240]   conference two weeks ago and says,
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.760]   Microsoft really should have bought us.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   What the hell?
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.520]   After the Google fiasco, Google backs off, he says,
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.640]   it would have been better for Microsoft
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.680]   if they-- better for them if they bought us.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.360]   Well, maybe I didn't understand what happened,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.320]   but it became apparent to me that the reason Microsoft
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.760]   didn't buy it, because he didn't want it.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.600]   Because that Jerry Yang.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.200]   And I think that's why he's out of work.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.000]   Co-founder Jerry Yang to step down following
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.840]   appointment a new CEO and returned to form a role as chief
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.120]   Yahoo and board member.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.360]   You've got to figure the board said, Jerry, it's just not working.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.280]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.960]   They didn't say Jerry.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   They said, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   Jerry.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.240]   You know how it goes in those boardrooms.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.160]   You've probably been there.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.520]   You've been there done that.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.840]   I've been the guy that's had to say, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.960]   We love you, Jerry, but you're just not a CEO.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.760]   But now they're going to go through a search.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.800]   In consultation with Jerry Yang, Chairman Roy Bostock
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.680]   is leading the process of assessing potential candidates
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.680]   determining fund.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.640]   Who can save Yahoo?
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.680]   This isn't really a Mac story, but--
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.600]   yeah, it kind of is.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.880]   I mean, we use Yahoo.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.960]   Do you?
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   No.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.680]   I use-- no.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.360]   You know where I use it?
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.320]   I use it on my iPhone as my chief male,
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.320]   because Yahoo's the only one that does push mail on the iPhone.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.800]   Unless you have exchange or something.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.680]   Yeah, I haven't searched on-- my wife uses Yahoo,
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.520]   and I come back when I come home, I see it, and I go,
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.880]   oh, that's so cute.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.000]   Other than Slicker, I don't use any Yahoo products.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.040]   All right, never mind then.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.640]   Forget we don't care about it.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.680]   How about this, the Mac Mall offering the new Macbook heirs?
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.560]   I don't know if they screwed up, but they're offering
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.480]   the Macbook heirs.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.960]   Did you see this?
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.520]   Mac did not.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.320]   Mac Mall.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.560]   dot com slash Mac Mall slash families.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.480]   Oops, let me pull this up.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.000]   Slash Macbook_air.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.320]   That's a very intuitive URL.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.240]   Somebody sent it to me.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.800]   Oh, Tony did our editor.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.280]   He found it.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.720]   So just look for Macbook heirs, I guess.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.280]   Is the key.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.880]   And here it is, and it says, introducing the new Macbook
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.280]   heir, better graphics, more storage, available--
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.840]   Well, actually it says in stock, usually ships
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.120]   the same business day.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.000]   Did Apple make an announcement that we missed?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.480]   Must have.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.640]   I have to admit to not paying a lot of attention
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.520]   because I'm very happy with my original error.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.560]   All I use it for basically is email and surfing the web
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.040]   when I'm traveling.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:31.960]   There may be something--
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.560]   I don't know.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.360]   The only difference is it has 9,400M graphics,
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.760]   and it's got a bigger hard drive.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.540]   For 1744, you get 120 gig moving drive,
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.560]   2 gigs of RAM, 1.6 gigahertz core 2.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.220]   Seems like it's all the same.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.960]   The only difference is video card and a bigger drive.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.600]   For the 2444, you get the 128 gig--
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.200]   Oh, 128 gig SSD.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.400]   Yeah, that's a different--
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.720]   you know, obviously all this stuff,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.320]   the SSD stuff's a lot cheaper than when they first announced.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.280]   But get this.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.720]   Blowout special, and this is at Mac Mall.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.080]   The original 1.6 gigahertz 2 gigabytes RAM,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.280]   80 gig hard drive, 1149.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.460]   Whoa.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.540]   How much did you pay for that?
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.940]   $1,149.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.180]   $1,149.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.900]   And then for what you paid for the original error,
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.380]   you can get the SSD version, $1749.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.900]   Now, I just hope that it comes out OK.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.900]   That's all I got to say, why buy in from Mac Mall?
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.820]   Is that a bad place?
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.460]   We ordered a computer that came.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.980]   It was DOA.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:36.420]   And it took us a month to get our money back after we mailed it
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.780]   back and everything else.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.140]   It was a mess.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.600]   So the error is now in the store with 24 hour shipping
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.220]   for the high end one and two to three week shipping
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.420]   for the low end one.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.960]   But let's-- where's the refurb page on?
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.860]   It's hard to find.
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.460]   You have to look for it.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.680]   Because that's probably where they'd have.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.520]   That's where I've been buying my computers lately.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.320]   And I've been scoring some pretty sweet deals.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.360]   apple.com store.applicott.com/us/brow/home/special
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   feel/mac.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.920]   That's the reason we could call that up off the top tip
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.720]   of my tongue for--
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.040]   OK, so you can get it for $1349.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.720]   That's 200 bucks more at the Apple Store for the--
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.280]   It's original.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.960]   --points out and get the one you order and then probably
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.040]   get better service.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.360]   Yeah, I'm afraid our last one, we got it primarily
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.280]   because they were bundling the bundling VMware with it.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.840]   And we've been installing VMware and Windows with every--
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.880]   with every computer.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.640]   And so we figured we'd save some money,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.480]   but it wasn't worth it.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.960]   When I returned my new MacBook Pro
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.840]   because of the trackpad issues, they were very helpful,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.960]   gave me all my money back, did everything immediately.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.760]   And then I bought the last generation fastest
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.400]   when you could get from the refurb store at 40% off.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.600]   So when you said, hey, you mean Mac Mall or you mean the--
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.120]   Apple.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.620]   Apple.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.880]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.800]   I mean, they were actually cheerful about giving me a refund.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.560]   Hi, we'd love to give you your money back.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.240]   No problem.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.720]   Pretty much what she said.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.880]   You know, that was my experience too.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.920]   Well, actually, I had two different experiences.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.640]   I went to one store, the Marin store,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.000]   and they said, where's the box?
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.200]   I said, the thing's dead.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.400]   Can't you just take it out of another box and give me the--
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.240]   and keep the--
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.040]   No, we need the original box and packing material.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.520]   Really?
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.880]   Yeah, and I had to drive all the back here.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.840]   And then so I said, well, I'm not going to go back to them.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.680]   I had a Rosa with the box.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.880]   And they said, oh, that's terrible.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.560]   Let's switch it.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.760]   And they switched it within a few minutes.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.760]   Where is the box?
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.240]   You can't come in here without the box.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.960]   I had to do mine by mail because as unbelievable as it
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.400]   may be to our audience, there is no Apple store to get caught.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   No, well, they should build one just for you.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:48.920]   Yes.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.280]   You probably keep it profitable.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.520]   I can keep it profitable.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.360]   So how many DOAs are we now?
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.920]   Maybe we've got the real story here.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.920]   How many DOAs have there been?
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.960]   Well, mine wasn't DOA.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.800]   Mine just had that weird stuff where the track pad would
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.680]   constantly be clicking even when I wasn't clicking.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.520]   So and they just fixed it.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.440]   They just didn't fix it.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.840]   They just gave you a new one.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.800]   They just-- well, no, actually I didn't want a new one
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.120]   because the lady was very forthright when I talked with her
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.480]   about it.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.160]   I just plain-- I just-- in my typical gent, T.O.E.,
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.760]   I said, you guys having problems with these suckers?
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.000]   And she said, yeah, there's some trackpad issues.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.400]   So I said, you know, I'm just not really
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.800]   going to be a beta candidate.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.800]   So just give me my money back and I'll
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.120]   go buy the last version, the fastest one I can get,
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.680]   and I'll wait till you guys sort it out.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.840]   So that's what I did.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.200]   And believe me, I was disappointed because everything else
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.120]   about it I loved.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.800]   But I didn't want to sit there and wait
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.080]   for them to figure out the trackpad.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.960]   So the next one we buy, I'll buy another one
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.160]   and see if it's working.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.560]   I'm buying one today.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.040]   Why does well buy that 24-inch cinema display, which
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.440]   is on sale today, too?
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.720]   That's about to say that's the big news for me.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.040]   That's available today.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.480]   Well, for order.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:13:59.920]   Right.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.280]   But you couldn't press the button until today.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.440]   At least I don't think so.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.680]   I wonder if they're available at the store.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.440]   They've had them to show at the store,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   but I don't know if you can pick one up.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.320]   You mean the store online store or the--
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.200]   No, the store at just like--
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.760]   The store store.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.920]   Yeah, I would have to--
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   We go into the Apple store with a cart store.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.840]   Usually when we order--
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.440]   See, unlike Gig Harbor, there's an Apple store
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.120]   right across the street from Pixelcore.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.920]   Yeah, and I know.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.480]   And yeah, we spend way too much money in there.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.800]   That's where you picked me up that time.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.000]   I bought a bunch of computers.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.440]   I did.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.560]   I remember that.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.960]   We had to do a sort of a special secret agent thing.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.640]   We had to have Apple store employee security.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.960]   That was pretty funny to see Scott
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.360]   standing on the curb with $12,000 with a computer.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.840]   And all these bums are walking up.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.800]   You got any spare CPUs?
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.840]   I'd like to borrow a cup of graphics display cards.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.880]   I was just getting a little nervous because it was taking
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.600]   a little longer than I thought.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.920]   And so then the business guy from the Apple store
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.040]   came out and stood with me.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.320]   And all these people were walking by,
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.800]   and they were literally going like this.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.360]   Smells like new computers.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:11.920]   I didn't take a while.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.480]   I couldn't figure out how to get the Bentley started.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.360]   I apologize.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.760]   Yeah, quit it.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.360]   You just-- you just brought the Lexus.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.040]   No, that was fun, actually.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   And I felt bad, though.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.360]   You were standing out there on the street.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.080]   I had to do really well.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.760]   I'm not complaining.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.080]   It was very kind of you to help me.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.000]   And how many people get Leo the port
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.720]   to pick him up with their brand new computer
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.880]   and take him home?
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.400]   Well, at least you.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.160]   At least one person.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.480]   I have to say, I'm very excited.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.160]   We have two of those 24-inch displays on order.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.120]   And I love the 24-inch display on the current iMac
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.840]   that I use so much so that I don't use the 30-inch displays.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.680]   By the way, because I mentioned that we don't use the 30-inch
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.520]   displays, we got like 200 emails in the last couple
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.040]   of months for people saying, can I have them?
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.320]   You know, I had the 30-inch display here on my desk.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.680]   And it was a little big.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.040]   I got the 24.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.840]   It fits just right, you know, the 24-iMac.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.240]   And guess where my 30-inches?
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.480]   I'm kind of feeling-- Colleen's got it up in her little office.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.440]   She's sitting there with her big 30-inch display.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.360]   And we're like, that's fine.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.320]   The 30-inch display.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.040]   Actually, my assistant, Karen, heard the show
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.840]   and barged in seconds after we were done and said,
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.560]   I'll be taking those.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.400]   No.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.440]   Colleen says, over my dead body, she's not going to let mine go.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.200]   But I do-- you know, I like that 24.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.040]   I don't know what I would do with it.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.960]   But what I do like, it has the display port at that--
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.120]   Well, it's got the eyesight.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.560]   It's really kind of one of the things--
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.200]   It's one of the things that one of our problems
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.760]   was all of our iMacs have the eyesight built in.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.200]   Our laptops have the eyesight built in.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.760]   And we've been using Skype a lot for video conferencing.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.080]   Like when we're talking in production.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.880]   So we wanted all the production computers to have those.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.080]   And we've been kind of holding off on buying more monitors
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.160]   until we could get ones with eyesight.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.840]   So we're going to bump everything up.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.360]   I don't know what I would do with it.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   I mean, I'm not--
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.120]   I'm going to have to buy some sort of adapter
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.000]   to connect that to my Octo, huh?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.240]   Your Octo?
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   The Mac Pro?
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.880]   Yeah, because you don't have a display port.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.560]   You have to buy the--
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.520]   I don't know.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.040]   There's an adapter for it.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:13.120]   So does the new 24 not have a regular input?
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.040]   It only has display port?
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.440]   Doesn't have a--
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440]   I haven't gotten it.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.600]   That's what I understand.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.800]   I don't should find it out here.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.280]   I'm looking on the Apple store.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.840]   They don't want you to know about it.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.320]   Shop accessories.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.640]   I believe in the accessory.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.040]   Shash is checking.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.440]   But he thinks I'm going to need a display port to DVI
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.040]   port connected.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.800]   Well, they sell those.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.280]   Well, yeah.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.160]   There's an afterstore.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.120]   They didn't have it when I bought my laptop.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.640]   MacBook Mac accessories, monitors.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.120]   How come I--
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.440]   It doesn't come with a DVI port on it.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.360]   So you're going to have to get--
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.920]   I'm going to have to get the--
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.400]   this is just like everything else.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   I mean, I buy the thing.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.120]   I get it home.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.960]   I open it up.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.520]   I go, oops.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.280]   Can't use it because I don't have that cable.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.880]   I was really sad when they stopped
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.080]   shipping cables with printers.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.000]   It's like so rude.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I mean, for Apple's whole deal of press a button,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.040]   turn it on, get it done.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.640]   Everything should be there.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   I don't understand.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.400]   I mean, charge me 10 or 20 bucks more.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.600]   But just give me what I need.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.120]   Don't--
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:09.840]   Especially--
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.960]   Well, especially given there--
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.720]   look, we can now admit it.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.560]   There's only Mac people listening.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.960]   Especially given that they charge a lot more
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.080]   for their hardware, right?
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.240]   It is more expensive, right?
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   It's more expensive.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.360]   I don't think it's a lot more, but I do think it's more.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:24.800]   I don't know.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.040]   When I look at a MacBook, as beautiful it is,
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   that's about twice as much as a comparable PC.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.440]   No, I think that once you spec the PC out at the same--
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.000]   Is it really close?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.600]   --at the same?
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.960]   I think it's your hard press to find--
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.200]   the price is oftentimes a little bit more expensive,
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.480]   but I value my time.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.440]   Is it the LED cinema display?
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440]   Is that what they're calling it?
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.520]   LED cinema display.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   OK.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.040]   Let's see.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.680]   That's why I'm in the display port.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.360]   Yeah, it looks like it doesn't--
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.280]   People are comparing that to other 24-inch displays,
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.440]   but they're not comparing it to LED displays.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.560]   So that's not a fair comparison.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.240]   Right.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.920]   I like LED, I have to say.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.840]   It's 900 bucks.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.800]   Connectors.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.680]   Mini Display Sport, universal magsafe, USB 2, and that's it.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.360]   You got a magsafe, man.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.160]   This is bad.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.080]   Shaftes just tell me there's no adapter cable yet.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.640]   Oh, man.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.760]   So I'll set it next to the Mac Pro and just sort of walk by.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.880]   You know, I do like it's Visa Mount compatible,
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.120]   so you could use a Visa Mount and put it on the wall
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.320]   if you wanted to--
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.240]   Yeah, but I just can't hook it up to the computer.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.320]   No, but well, you don't-- yes, right.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:30.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.320]   Sorry.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.760]   Sorry.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.640]   That may be because of HDCP.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.240]   Yeah, maybe--
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.840]   Oh, that's right.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   I'll update over that, over the iTunes HDCP stuff.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.240]   Apparently, the-- now, according to--
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.520]   this is Mac Rumor's just published
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.160]   as Story Arnold Kim wrote it today,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.160]   that the new Unibody Notebooks--
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.560]   is that where we're going to call them from now on the Unibodies?
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.400]   I don't know if that's really a good name for them.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   I like the name, but that's what he's got.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:01.000]   Incorporate HDCP, the high bandwidth digital content
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.160]   protection system.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.800]   There's also speculation that just the regular MacBook
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.560]   Pro uses that.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.320]   Why wouldn't we know this?
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.480]   I don't know.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.560]   You would think this is-- I mean, this is the kind of thing
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.200]   that usually stirs up a lot of angst and anger.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.840]   So--
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.040]   According to-- so he quotes R's Technica, who said,
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.800]   "When my friend John, a high school teacher,
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.320]   attempted to play Hellboy 2 on his classroom's projector."
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.240]   You see, that right there, there's a problem.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.480]   But we'll go on.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   With a new aluminum MacBook over lunch,
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.800]   he was denied by the error.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.560]   This movie cannot be played because a display that is not
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.160]   authorized to play protected movies is connected.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:39.640]   Why?
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.320]   Because they're not connecting any displays that are not--
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.440]   try disconnecting any displays that are not HDCP authorized.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.520]   So they put it in there.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.120]   He was using the DisplayPort to VGA adapter
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.960]   plugged into a Sanio projector.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.040]   Of course, the projector is not HDCP aware.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.040]   But maybe the adapter isn't.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.760]   Well, maybe it's just saying if the projector doesn't have HDCP,
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.320]   it's not going to let it play.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.200]   For some--
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.720]   Because once it goes to VGA, it's
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.440]   going to essentially an analog signal.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.760]   I mean, it's not going to carry any of that information.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.400]   Right.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.960]   The Apple TV also supports HDCP over its HDMI connector
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.760]   put into this article.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.240]   We didn't know that, did we?
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.960]   Well, to get HDMI, it would need to.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.440]   Right?
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.520]   Yeah, we knew that because it had HDMI.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.080]   But HDMI doesn't automatically have HDCP.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.840]   Doesn't it?
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.040]   That's part of the stack, I believe.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.680]   Oh, it is.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.680]   The new HDMI--
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.480]   I stand corrected.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.240]   1.3.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.880]   I stand corrected.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.680]   I do not aware of.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.240]   I spoke.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.800]   Discontinued the 23-inch, too.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.760]   By the way.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.560]   Bye-bye.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.600]   So why would you buy the 23 when it's--
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.400]   When you can get the 24, it's the same price,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.240]   and it's better.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:51.880]   It's better.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.320]   Except you can't connect it to your octa.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.760]   It has speakers in it, too.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.120]   It's got everything you need.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.520]   I think it's actually designed.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.840]   If you look at the way it's designed,
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.200]   it is designed to work specifically in tandem
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.800]   with the new MacBook Pros and to sort of act
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.480]   as a little mini docking station.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   Right.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.800]   That's tempting to have that maybe at home, where I use my MacBook
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.000]   Pro.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.480]   But part of the reason I use my MacBook Pro at home
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.240]   is that I have nowhere to put a computer.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.080]   But I'm sure there are others who do not--
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.280]   are not deprived of the way I am.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.920]   My wife has deprived me.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.160]   So this is the Merlin Man Honorary story.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.920]   The Merlin Man Memorial Beatles story.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.040]   A lost track recorded by the band in 1967
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.440]   and performed only once in public might be released
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.520]   Paul McCartney who--
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.640]   Liar!
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.320]   Told everybody-- Liar that the Beatles' "erve"
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.240]   would be available online by now.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.320]   Well, he has one more month, six more weeks.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.440]   He said it'd be 2008.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.280]   Liar!
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:01.600]   He's running--
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.080]   Well, he's not a liar yet.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.080]   I think you're imminent liar.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.320]   Another year to be a liar?
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.760]   May a good Christmas gift.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.120]   Yeah, it would be.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.280]   Paul McCartney told-- just every month of 2008,
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.680]   I downloaded another Beatles album illegally just
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.640]   to make them feel the pain.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.040]   So every month, Paul, that you delay another album,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.920]   another lost $1.53.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.640]   So just keep that in mind.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.120]   He says-- actually, I didn't do that.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.080]   If the RIA is listening, I would never dream of doing that.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.120]   I purchased all my Beatles music legally
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.840]   by going to a store and buying a used vinyl record.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.120]   Paul McCartney told the BBC in the--
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.640]   according to a report in the Observer newspaper,
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   the 14-minute Carnival of Light.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.200]   Do you know that song, Scott Warren Beatles' Eficionado?
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.120]   I believe that's an unreleased track.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.880]   That would be an unreleased track.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.160]   It was considered too adventurous.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.440]   He said it's too adventurous.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.760]   We can't release it.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.600]   Yeah, that's the special unreleased track
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.920]   that everybody's been waiting on.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.680]   Paul has the master.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.440]   Of course.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.440]   And he wants--
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.000]   I'm surprised Michael Jackson didn't try to buy that too.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.560]   He says, I like it because it's the Beatles free going off
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.840]   pieced, whatever that means.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.680]   What's that mean off pieced?
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.920]   P-I-S-T-E.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.800]   Everybody, thank you.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.200]   I've gotten about 20 emails plus shash chatting with me,
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.480]   giving me all the URLs.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.480]   There is a cable that will make my--
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.080]   Well, but is it available?
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.520]   Is it probably?
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.160]   Yeah, it is available.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.520]   It is available at the Apple Store or at Amazon.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.080]   All right.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.080]   Excellent.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   This is great.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.280]   I don't have to think anymore.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.880]   We just let the audience do that for me.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.120]   Two, it's crowdsourcing my brain.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.640]   That's great.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.360]   By the way, we should mention that Apple did issue an update
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.200]   for the trackpad on the MacBook Pros.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.680]   Whether or not it will solve the problem I was having,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.640]   I'm dubious, but it is out there.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.080]   Is that that update that just came out?
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.080]   I just got it.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.040]   Just came out.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.040]   The thing is--
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.120]   Yours is working fine.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.440]   No, my click is a little suspicious, though.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.000]   My click is sometimes it does.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.480]   Sometimes it does.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.360]   So here's the question, Leo.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.000]   When you click, is it that sometimes it doesn't register
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.480]   the click?
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.400]   Yes.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.120]   See, that's what that update for.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.520]   My problem was that I wouldn't be clicking.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.000]   It would come.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.040]   I wouldn't be touching it.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.520]   And it would just be click click click.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.560]   No, I think you had a hardware problem,
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.400]   because that's not usual.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.760]   But I've talked to many people, including Kevin Rose, who
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.960]   say, yeah, it just doesn't register the clicks.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.520]   It does if you do-- you turn on tap,
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.240]   because I use tap a lot.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.360]   But if you want that click to work, for some reason,
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.440]   it just doesn't seem to register it always.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.200]   It can be a little frustrating record here.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.240]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.960]   Can't we just have our dad, gum, click button back?
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.880]   It worked for a person.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.040]   It's just too much.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.280]   But I have to say, I hated the Mighty Mouse.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.000]   I complained incessantly about the Mighty Mouse.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.560]   And now, every time I pick up one of the newer computers,
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.640]   it has the old--
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.760]   you know, the old--
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.160]   you doesn't have a Mighty Mouse?
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.080]   I'm kind of disappointed.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.120]   Are you eating chips, Scott?
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.640]   No, I just got a UPS package.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.000]   Sorry.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.280]   Oh.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.080]   I'm like that, too.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.960]   I can't resist.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.280]   Ooh, something exciting.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.760]   Oh my god.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.760]   This guy's here in the office handing it to me.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.240]   Oh, OK.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.360]   So I got the new lens baby composer.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:07.840]   Ooh.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.040]   Oh, Ozzy, are you excited about the lens baby?
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.480]   Good boy.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.680]   Town dog.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.480]   Every time you say lens baby, my dog gets excited.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.160]   OK.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.920]   Out of focus photography?
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.480]   Wow.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.120]   Cool.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.880]   It's the age of a portion of a tautophobe.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.720]   Yes.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.480]   Selective.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.320]   Selective.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.880]   So 7115iPhotoUpdate improves the printing quality.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.680]   That's an older one.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.360]   They did send out some raw definitions for aperture
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.280]   and iPhoto for the EOS 50D, then D90, the DSLR 900,
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.760]   and the cool pins P6000, but not.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.120]   Not the LX3.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.640]   What is going on?
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.960]   It's just missed the cycle, and that's the way that goes.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.240]   Well, I've been reading.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.400]   One thing that seems to be--
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.480]   the silky picks that comes with the LX3, this weird Chinese
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.200]   software that comes with it.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.680]   That does do it.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.480]   And apparently, I've been reading up on the sites that--
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.120]   it's because of-- they want some--
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.320]   Panasonic wants barrel correction in the raw.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.240]   That's because they have--
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.240]   they're doing that correction.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.880]   When you see the J-Pig, they're doing--
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.600]   Or their own software.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.440]   They're quietly doing the barrel correction.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.920]   And they have some great samples online.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.040]   We've talked about that on this weekend photography.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.080]   There's some little corrections going on there.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.760]   So you think it's adobe is unwilling to do it
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.960]   or may not do it right?
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.960]   I just think it's going to take some time for them
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.880]   to figure it out.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.160]   It's an extra thing.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.000]   What is barrel correction?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.720]   When you shoot really wide open, you get this effect that some
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.840]   people actually enjoy, where the picture becomes somewhat
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.560]   circular.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.080]   The things that are straight up--
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.640]   It's been yet?
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.200]   Oh, I see.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:44.640]   It's been out.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.320]   Things that are straight up and down no longer appear straight
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:47.760]   up and down.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.640]   They appear to have a curve.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.920]   I have really good examples of that.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.000]   That's nice.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.240]   And if you were to shoot--
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.320]   if you were to shoot with Alex's little-- what is it?
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.440]   8 or 10 millimeters.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.800]   I got an 8 millimeter sigma.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.760]   Oh, you'd see it.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.240]   It's all barrel distortion.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:01.920]   But I like it.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.400]   I like the look.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.960]   Because the LX3 is a very wide angle, for a point and shoot,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.840]   it's wide angle.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.440]   So it has a little bit of distortion.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.240]   But I suspect Apple and Adobe are saying, well, wait a minute.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.040]   Maybe we don't want to correct that.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   What does raw mean to you?
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.000]   Can't you do it in Photoshop?
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.880]   Oh, there's some--
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.640]   There's barrel distortion.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.120]   There's barrel distortion pointing.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.120]   What's that?
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.680]   Here's the thing.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.000]   There's barrel distortion in every single wide angle
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.760]   lens in the world.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.960]   And I think what Panasonic was trying to do--
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.040]   Pretend there is.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.160]   --is just help people deal with it.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.360]   And that's turned into, oh, it's a great conspiracy.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.480]   And it's just--
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.560]   you can try to do something good.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.600]   You get slam forward.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.080]   I suspect this will all be resolved in the next update.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.240]   And by the way, for those who don't pay attention to twitphoto.com,
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.440]   we did do a test of the new printing service from Apple.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.480]   Banta-puru-spentacular-cool.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:58.920]   Really?
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.160]   Better than say blurb?
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.720]   In my opinion.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.520]   Yes.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.480]   And there's sash with your cable.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.460]   Let's see.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.760]   There's also security update.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.560]   And I presume--
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.040]   I don't know.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.880]   Well, it says a security update.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.120]   2008, 007.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.800]   Is this where the keyboard patches?
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.280]   No, there's some--
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.560]   I believe that there's one security update that's
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.520]   only relative to people who are using Tiger.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.160]   What is going on in there?
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.960]   I don't know.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.480]   Let's see.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.200]   Name and information.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.640]   Look at all the things it fixes.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.120]   Wow.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:33.440]   OK.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:33.920]   Here we go.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.160]   Oh, no, that's an old one.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.520]   That's October 2.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.720]   Oh, 7 is an old one.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.200]   Safari 3.2 was went out, came out 13 November.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.640]   I-Life support 10 November.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.960]   The new iPhoto security update is only for people
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.680]   using Tiger.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.600]   I know that.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   Oh.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.520]   OK.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:57.000]   And we have pretty much covered, I believe,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.480]   all the other updates.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.080]   The most important one, of course, is the track path one.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.840]   And then for me, was the printing update to aperture.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.800]   Oh, I'm looking at it.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.160]   OK.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.280]   I'm doing it on iMac.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.080]   It would probably do it.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.800]   I'd have to do it on my MacBook to see the--
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.880]   does this see that happen?
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.280]   That makes sense.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.240]   That makes-- I'm foolish me.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.640]   I'm foolish.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.200]   Let's see what other stories are in the mix before we get
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.600]   to our picks.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.720]   And maybe while I'm thinking of stories,
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.600]   I should mention our fine sponsor.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.200]   How about that?
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:25.840]   That would be one.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.680]   Fotable.com/macbreak.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   That's the place to go to get your very good deal.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.440]   Well, free is a good deal, I think.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.920]   For credit toward a free book, any book.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.520]   Now, some of the books in the Audible library
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.680]   are multiple credits.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.960]   The bigger books are.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.640]   So you get one credit, so you can make it half of a long book
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.720]   or all of a short book.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.880]   But the point is to get you to go to audible.com
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.200]   just to see the variety of amazing stuff.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.040]   They're getting more and more books on audible.com.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.600]   In fact, to the point where they're actually
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.760]   building studios to record, because not all publishers
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.480]   want to record books, but Audible knows
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.480]   you want to hear them in audio.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.880]   Now, do they have their own little studio?
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.080]   Nine recording studios in Newark.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.580]   Wow.
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.280]   Beautiful, too.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.680]   They're really nice.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   That's where I did my little golden writing hood.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.120]   It was really fun.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:14.600]   Really fun.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.240]   I don't really think it's a book until it's in Audible form.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.560]   I think--
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.480]   I agree with you.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.720]   That's why Spartans really--
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.760]   No, I was just listening to that this morning.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.280]   Have you been following the debate
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.760]   over Hillary Clinton becoming Secretary of State
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:39.680]   and perhaps getting Republicans in the cabinet?
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.200]   And frequently, they refer to a book
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:47.000]   called "Team of Rivals," which is the story of Abraham Lincoln's
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.040]   cabinet, where he brought in many of his rivals,
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.760]   his political rivals, because he said the nation needs it.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.200]   We aren't tough times.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.000]   And it was an amazing success.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.560]   Doris Kern's good one, the very famous presidential historian
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.320]   has written a wonderful book.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.000]   She's just my favorite author.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.600]   I love her.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.480]   She knows stuff that nobody else knows.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.040]   William Seward, Salmon Pete Chase, Edward Bates, and Lincoln,
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.200]   all expected to get the Republican nomination in 1860
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:15.760]   for president.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.280]   Lincoln, of course, beat them.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.120]   They ended up, though, in his cabinet.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.120]   And it's essentially like having Hillary Clinton
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.320]   as your Secretary of State or Gates as your Secretary of Defense.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.400]   It's bringing the best minds, regardless
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.760]   of previous rivalries together, because the country needs it.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.800]   This is a great piece of history,
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.280]   but that may actually apply to the present, too.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.960]   Wonderful book, highly recommended.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.320]   She's a great writer, really brings it alive.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.120]   And I read every book about Lincoln.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.120]   I can read.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.200]   There are actually quite a few wonderful Lincoln books.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.240]   Well, every single book she's ever written has been kind of--
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.320]   it's like, I can't stop reading.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.360]   I'm always sad when the book's over and go, wait a minute.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.120]   Wait, can't we talk some more?
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.160]   I didn't know you loved history.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.280]   I'm particularly a fan of history,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.400]   and particularly a fan of political history and military history.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.760]   I love that.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.640]   But mostly, it's because she does it with the kind of passion
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.320]   Leo that we do this show.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.040]   Yes.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.600]   I mean, we're not just actors reading scripts.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.680]   People come to us all the time, wants to do shows.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.320]   We have to say no, because we're not into that.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.840]   That's something we're interested in.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.080]   Doris is into this stuff.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.560]   And you can just see her face.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.280]   I was very privileged to be on a panel once with her.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.320]   And you just see her face light up.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.400]   It's unbelievable.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.040]   She just makes you want to learn about it,
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.720]   even if you didn't think you had any interest in it.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.720]   Some of you may have seen her on The Daily Show.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.400]   She's fantastic with John Stewart on there.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.080]   Team of rivals are Pick of the Week,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.040]   the political genius of Abraham Lincoln.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.600]   Listen to a book.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.720]   It is a great way to learn.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.680]   I always mention driving in the car.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   It's great for commutes, which you don't have anymore.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   Alex Lindsey, but you could listen to us.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.160]   No, I still have-- I have one on the bus.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.120]   You could listen on the bus.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.920]   But Scott doesn't have a commute.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.680]   I don't have a commute.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.160]   So I listen--
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.360]   It takes me eight minutes.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.400]   I'll have you know to get from my home to my office.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.560]   I have a 20 minute walk.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.640]   So 20 minutes is good.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.960]   It takes me about 10 minutes.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.520]   So when I walk to work, I get 40 minutes of reading that day.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.240]   That's pretty good.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.520]   I feel pretty good about that.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.160]   I was making soup this morning, which
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.200]   is a lot of chopping.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.200]   And I realized-- and I was listening to my book.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.560]   And I thought, oh, while you're cooking,
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.240]   or any kind of domestic--
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:18.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.920]   This is starting to sound like that guy that comes on
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.520]   where the oxy-clean commercial--
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.480]   Yes, you can--
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.640]   And he shouts the whole thing.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.600]   You can do it anywhere.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.800]   You can do what you're cooking.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.120]   You can do what you're driving.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.520]   You can do what you're in the car.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.720]   You can do what you're in the bus.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.840]   No, that's the great thing about it.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.440]   I feel like no moment of mine is wasted.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.680]   And nowadays, with all the information out there
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.360]   that we want to absorb, this is a great way to do it.

[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.640]   If you love history, you're going to love Team of Rivals.

[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.600]   We thank them so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.880]   Did you guys find anything while I was gone?
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.400]   For what?
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.080]   Take of the week?
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.520]   Well, we could do it with the pick of the week.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.880]   I would say any more stories.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.320]   It's been kind of-- it's a light week this week, I guess.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.520]   We hit the big ones.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.120]   The cinema display.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.400]   We talked about the updates.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.160]   I mean, strictly, the thing almost everybody's talking about
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.200]   is the stupid keypad update.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.880]   Yeah, well, thank goodness they fixed that.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.760]   HDCP and the laptops, yes.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.960]   OK, I will mention there's this very, very important thing
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.800]   people should know.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.400]   It's not top of this week's news.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:39.320]   But if you have a MacBook Pro, and you
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:46.120]   don't use it for two years, the battery will grow fat and bloat.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.800]   Do you have battery swell, battery bloat?
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.600]   There's a blog on Consumer Reports that talks about this.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.840]   This comes courtesy of my friend Shash.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.600]   I verified it.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.120]   It's true.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.400]   It's probably not just a Apple thing.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.600]   I mean, any dulphium ion battery.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.400]   And any human being who just sits there for two years.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.680]   They're also blumped.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.880]   And you see, I've been trying to conduct that experiment myself.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.400]   And I can say absolutely true that having just sat here
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.280]   for the last two years, I have grown fat and bloated.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.480]   Unrecognized clicks fixed.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.920]   That's to me that is your right.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.000]   That's the big story.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.480]   I'm just happy.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.760]   And that shows you what kind of week we have, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.960]   Where the unrecognized click error is the pick of the week.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.200]   The top story.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.640]   Do you actually have to go pick of the week when you're ready?
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.520]   The one thing that I think is interesting about the HDCP
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.720]   thing, just to go back to that.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.200]   I'm just looking a little bit more of the information
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:43.680]   about that.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.280]   The interesting is whether that will reduce people's interest
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.360]   in doing as much--
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.040]   if it doesn't work very well, it's
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.640]   going to make me much less interested in buying stuff
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.280]   from iTunes.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.120]   Copy potentials.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.200]   It's a bag of hurt.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.040]   I have to say, it's kind of a bummer.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   And every time you add that stuff, people go, ah, it's
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.400]   easier to download it off a bit, Torrance.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.320]   That's the issue is that, well, here's the question is,
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.720]   how many people know how to steal video?
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.880]   But it's just something that has to be underscored again
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.800]   and again to the studios.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.160]   There is a free, maybe illegal, but there's
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.720]   a free alternative that has unprotected high quality versions
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.760]   of every movie you're selling.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.400]   And as more and more people know about that,
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.880]   this is something you've got to consider.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.760]   And you have to give them a reason to buy, simply threatening
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.120]   them isn't going to do it.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.640]   Or appealing to their better angels isn't going to do it.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.000]   I just got the Wall-E the other day.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.480]   I love them.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.400]   And I haven't gotten-- I'm just about to download it
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.600]   because it came with the digital copy.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.640]   So I bought the Blu-Ray for it.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.360]   But it comes with a digital copy that's just putting it on.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.800]   I don't know if it's a download.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.520]   Do you have to download it?
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.280]   Is that the how it works?
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.080]   No, no, I'm pretty sure it's on the disc.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.240]   But I haven't had time to pull it over.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.320]   But it's-- yeah, it's a lot of quality in the Blu-Ray.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.400]   That'd be a very good one.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.960]   No, I'm very excited about seeing it.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.600]   But that's the kind of thing.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.400]   It's going in the right direction.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.280]   I agree with Alex.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.160]   I think that once you've paid your $60,
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.800]   they ought to give it to you every way you might want it.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.400]   And I think that's fair.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.600]   What I don't think is fair being a creative person who
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.880]   makes a living selling my creative is for people
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.040]   to use my work without paying me anything.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.680]   So I understand why people want to do something
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.400]   in a way of protection.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.760]   But I think doing something where once they've paid me,
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.840]   I'm like, go nuts.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.120]   That's why I sell a lot of my images royalty free.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   If you have Mr. MacMania 8 crews,
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.040]   there is a slideshow now online at macworld.com
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.880]   because Macworld sponsored it.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.200]   Did you go and come back already?
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.440]   No, I wish-- you know who did is Randall.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.960]   Oh, he goes on all of them, though.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.600]   The Costa Atlantica.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.120]   But I am going on MacMania 9 to China,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.600]   and invite everybody to come--
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.760]   I couldn't remember which one you were going on.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.400]   Some good pictures of David Pogue and his son Kelly.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.520]   That's a great shot.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.800]   I love the Pogue Meister.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.720]   He was on that cruise in Randall Schwartz was as well.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:01.000]   So there's a picture of the pyramids and all the Mac maniacs
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.840]   lined up at the pyramids.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.680]   Very cool.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.440]   Macworld.com has that.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.000]   Also another story, minor story, but I think
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   relevant.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.240]   Son's star office is going to be Mac Native.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.400]   Star office is kind of the basis for open office, which
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.520]   is also going to be Mac Native.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.800]   What are you doing?
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.280]   It's not me.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.680]   Are you undressing in there, Scott?
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.040]   What is going on?
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.240]   I have a beautiful model who just walked in.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.560]   It's a good thing we didn't do video today.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.120]   Oh, that was your head whipping around to the right.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   That was whiplash.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.320]   Hello, hello, pretty lady.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.400]   Hello.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.200]   I'm sorry, ma'am.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.680]   It's not quite time for you to just robe yet.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.040]   OK, so we've got 15 minutes before we
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.680]   have to let Scott go and take pictures of pretty people.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.360]   Oh, no, are we?
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.040]   In fact, did we go over time on you?
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:50.760]   We're fine.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.600]   Are you sure?
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.360]   We're fine.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.520]   She's not going anywhere.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.920]   Would you tie her up?
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.160]   No, I did not.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.000]   But I'm getting paid to do this, so everything's fine.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.680]   Let's get your pics of the week, Scott Bourne.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.760]   You can start in that way.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.440]   Should anything come up, you can address it.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.280]   It's not that critical.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.080]   My pick of the week is about an Alex.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.160]   And in fact, it's the actual Alex metric.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.520]   It's Photoshop CS4.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.080]   I have to say that I don't automatically
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.840]   think all these upgrades are worth it.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.320]   But this one, if you're a photographer,
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.520]   I absolutely think it's worth it.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.320]   There's some very cool new features
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.280]   that going forward are worth the pain
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.400]   you're going to have to put in to learn things now.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.960]   Because there is a little pain associated
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.080]   with a new interface and a little learning curve.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.880]   But it's the way everything is going to go,
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.680]   because all the Adobe apps now look and feel the same.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.800]   They all work the same.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.120]   They all have the same interface.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.520]   They're all very interchangeable.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.600]   And CS4 has adopted that interface.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.280]   Doing things like masks are so easy now that my Aunt Fay
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.640]   could do them.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.760]   There's cool new features that allow you to do content
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.640]   or scaling.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.880]   That's a very cool feature.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.760]   And my favorite new feature is that we've
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.920]   got the ability now to do the equivalent
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.880]   of high dynamic range tone maps only for focus,
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.080]   not for exposure.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.920]   So that means if you want to take 20 pictures
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   with different points in the picture and focus, you can choose.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.760]   You can do that.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.560]   And then all--
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.760]   And CS4 will merge the layers and identify
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.520]   which points need to stack on top of each other
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.200]   so that the whole photograph front to back is in focus.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.440]   And I have a video, by the way, on Vimeo,
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.680]   where I demonstrate this.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   If you all search for that, you can see it in real life.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.360]   It is very cool.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.280]   Yeah, it's a really--
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.920]   a lot of times when you're taking product shots,
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.920]   it can be very hard to get just what you want
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.880]   and keep it all in focus.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.520]   And so especially for stuff like that, it's very, very useful.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.040]   Yeah, it's a great update.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.280]   If you do macro, for instance, this is a real problem,
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.880]   trying to get any kind of depth of field in macro
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.880]   is almost impossible.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.520]   So this solves that problem.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.560]   The content of our scaling thing is a little gimmicky right now,
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   but I see it having a ton of applications they develop.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.760]   And all these new things that Photoshop always introduces,
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.480]   you know, at first, you wonder what they're for.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.240]   But then, you know, by the time they've
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.960]   been in two or three versions, you're like,
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.920]   how can I live without it?
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.200]   I think that the interface is also a really big story.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.680]   And if you do have a good computer, the OpenGL stuff,
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.080]   Leo, being able to sort of flick the picture around,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.160]   sort of like you can toss it around on the screen.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.680]   I don't know how to accurately describe
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.000]   what that looks like, but it's very cool.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.200]   Huh.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.040]   That is cool.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.280]   That's pretty neat that they built that in.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.720]   They said when there is 64-bit just
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.440]   going to have to wait till CS5.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.040]   No, 64-bit printing is available.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.960]   64-bit as far as the--
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.880]   Oh, I've got the software, not the--
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.720]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.600]   I haven't heard anything from it like that.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.000]   You know, it's not a big deal.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.560]   It's a minor thing.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.760]   Well, you know, those things PC guys can lord over us, you know?
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.920]   Well, but see, here's the thing.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.840]   The OpenGL means that they are getting some real significant
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.080]   support from the GPU.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:13.520]   And the net effect is 64-bit like speed.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.720]   This thing, it just boots up instantly.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.000]   It's fast.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.600]   It's noticeably fast on a really big machine
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.760]   with a lot of RAM.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.440]   And I mean, normally, you know, I read these reports,
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.120]   some guy benchmarked something using some software,
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.520]   and it's 2.9, you know, tens of a second faster,
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.400]   and everybody gets excited.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.880]   This is one of those deals where you don't need any fancy
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.680]   Smancy software.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.720]   You just look at it and you'll, wow, that is fast.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.880]   I think that's sufficient.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.720]   You know, speed is what we care about.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.480]   I guess 64-bit means you can access more RAM,
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.600]   but you can access enough RAM, right?
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.800]   I know that there is-- actually, one person
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.520]   we're going to have on the show soon,
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.360]   Greg Downing on this week in photography,
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.440]   he uses the PC version specifically
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.960]   because he uses so much RAM that he's actually
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.280]   unable to open his files.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:03.720]   So it is.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.560]   He's doing gigabit images.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.160]   Really crazy large images.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.080]   But I think for most people listening to this show,
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.600]   people want to see what he's doing.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   It's Greg Downing.com.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.760]   But if outside of that, I haven't heard anybody running out
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.120]   of RAM.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.800]   Well, I'm using some pretty big files,
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:30.080]   sometimes taken off of digital backs that are generating 40,
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.480]   50 megapixel images.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.600]   And I'm using just a 4 gigabyte RAM on an iMac,
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.360]   and it works fine.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.480]   Cool.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.120]   So that's my pick, CS4.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.600]   CS4, Alex Lindsay.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.120]   What is your pick?
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:49.600]   I hesitate to pick this application.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.040]   He's pulling it out of his pocket.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.520]   It must be a small application.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.360]   It's on my iPhone.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:53.720]   OK.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.480]   What is it?
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.960]   I hesitate to tell people about this because I have to have
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.040]   a warning label.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.920]   Is it addictive?
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.760]   It's not addictive.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.240]   It is.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.120]   It's not desktop tower defense for the iPhone,
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.440]   because that's what I've been waiting on.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.360]   But that would be awesome.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.160]   And a problem.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.360]   And a productively--
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.080]   No, but this one's becoming a productivity problem for me.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.360]   I'm hoping to get through it.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:13.880]   Oh my gosh.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.640]   OK, so I'm warning everybody.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.440]   Don't do this.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:17.160]   Don't do this.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.080]   Just listen.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.720]   Don't be careful.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.720]   Don't listen.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.360]   This is bad.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:20.880]   This is bad.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.920]   You're warning.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.240]   Aaron Mayler, who's our producer for TwiPS sent me this.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.520]   It's all his fault.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.720]   And it is called Touch Physics.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.560]   Oh.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.160]   OK.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:31.760]   Oh, cool.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.760]   OK.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.280]   So--
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.080]   That's a show.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.000]   You're giving it a brand over here for those of you
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.080]   who are watching it here.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.920]   I'm going to go to it live feed.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.440]   You could play it.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.920]   If you play it right there, they'll see it.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.560]   OK, so--
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.000]   You know, I've wanted this--
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.160]   I saw this like a YouTube video of it.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:45.640]   Is it on there?
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.840]   Whoops, let me--
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.320]   And I've wanted this for some time.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:49.280]   This looks so cool.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.880]   So what you have is I can go--
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.680]   I can draw a little circle, and I can go--
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.320]   Oh, look.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.000]   And it has physics.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:55.800]   So it drops.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.960]   And now it makes something else go.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.240]   Are there puzzles in this?
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.800]   The whole puzzle is you have to get the little ball
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.360]   to go over the little star.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.640]   And at the beginning, it sounds easy.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.000]   I'll just drop it out of their ball.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.680]   Have it--
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.640]   Oh, you missed it?
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.280]   I missed it.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.480]   So then you go-- we'll do one little closer.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.240]   Boom.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.360]   That's just like pool.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.160]   That's easy.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:13.960]   It gets harder.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.760]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   Here's the thing is you get ones.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.120]   Like that one.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:18.120]   So--
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.920]   How do you get to that?
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.680]   Now, can you draw things besides balls?
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.240]   This one--
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.520]   So you drop it--
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.480]   Do you draw supermodels?
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.840]   So I just hit it hard enough.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:28.920]   So a bigger rock.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.400]   Bigger rock.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.240]   You know, force it to go.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.720]   But then you get ones like, OK, so now what do I do?
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.040]   So this one, this one is-- you know, I draw a little--
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.160]   and you know, so I drew a little--
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.160]   whoops, there we go.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:48.040]   So you can draw a little like little pieces.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.000]   But the thing is you get ones--
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.120]   this one took me a little while because the--
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.720]   Now remember, most people are listening.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.560]   They're not watching.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.040]   So what you have here, though, is with each one of them--
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.240]   here's essentially when you're listening to this,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.160]   what happens is that you see something--
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.640]   the first couple, you're like, oh, this is easy.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.720]   And then by the time you get to level five or six,
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.080]   you just see images like--
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.760]   I have-- there is no way I can get that ball to hit that star.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.680]   You know, you're just like--
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.080]   But is it always drawing a little ball that
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.920]   falls out of the sky?
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.280]   I mean--
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.480]   No, the ball comes with it.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.840]   So you have to draw objects.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.800]   You draw it with your hand.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.960]   Well, can you draw things besides--
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.360]   I mean, does anything--
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.720]   But you can draw like sticks.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.240]   So like, I could build a--
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.720]   Oh, you could build a lever.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.440]   Yeah, you build levers and little patterns.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.360]   You could make a seesaw kind of--
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:31.860]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.560]   It's-- you can get into the air catapult.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.080]   You could build a trebuchet.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:35.720]   Exactly.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.220]   I don't know.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.760]   Trebuchet might be complicated.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.160]   But it was one of those things that I was like, oh, this is
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:40.760]   kind of cute.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.840]   And now, it's just like every time I have a little time,
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.800]   I'm like, oh, I'm looking down and kind of working
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.960]   through the--
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.040]   What's the name of it again?
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.320]   It's called Touch Physics.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:53.240]   So I'm kind of embarrassed because I have a very similar pick.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.440]   But OK.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.360]   And this is related--
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.600]   How much is yours?
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.640]   99 cents.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.560]   Well, that's close to--
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.160]   So the--
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:00.680]   You search this--
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.520]   It's very similar.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.660]   It's fine, my pick right next to it.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.300]   It's so funny.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.660]   Oh, is it because you have yours is--
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.860]   Mine's Jelly Car.
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.060]   Have you seen Jelly Car?
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:07.620]   I haven't seen Jelly Car.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.220]   All right, well, I'll talk about that in a second.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.540]   There's also roller coaster physics.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.660]   Now, if you don't have an eye--
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.780]   if you don't have an iPhone, one of these things,
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.340]   you know, these phone things, this is very similar to
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.180]   crayon physics.
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.100]   That's the one I want it.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:21.540]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.260]   So crayon physics will work on your Mac.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.020]   But this is very, very, very similar.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.060]   And then there's crayon physics deluxe, which I come out--
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.100]   That's the YouTube--
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:28.820]   It doesn't come out yet.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:29.620]   OK.
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.360]   That was very exciting when that was--
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.000]   Outrageous.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:32.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.000]   That's really fun.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.080]   So the idea is it's really crumbled piece of paper,
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.400]   and you're just drawing stuff.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.200]   And the thing becomes an object as soon as you draw it with--
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:39.680]   With physics.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.560]   With real physics.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.280]   So it drops, or it does.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:48.000]   And it reminds me of one of my favorite little software
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.200]   from OS 9 was a little program called Interactive Physics.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.520]   And I used to--
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.760]   because you could build all kinds of little apparatuses
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.120]   and stuff like that, and then launch it,
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.400]   turn on the simulation.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.280]   And it's just a training-- it's an educational game
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.460]   for kids for schools.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.360]   But it is fascinating.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.160]   So this is getting going down that path.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.400]   That's 99 cents.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.120]   It's called Touch Physics.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.560]   It is an iPhone game.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.800]   Painfully addictive.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.560]   And I can see I'm downloading it right now.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.600]   I can see how addictive that would be.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.960]   I guess, in a way, the Google Search, the voice search,
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.920]   is really so cool.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.640]   I think really should be a pick.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.800]   We started the show with it.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:24.920]   But I'll make that one pick.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.800]   But then the other one, which I think maybe as addictive--
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.480]   it's very similar in some ways.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.360]   It's another game.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.600]   I'm sorry to do this to you-- is Jelly Car.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.360]   Now this is free.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.800]   And if you search for Jelly Car one word, you'll see this.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.760]   And it's a kind of a silly little game.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.240]   You can pick-- everything's kind of jelly and squishy.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.320]   So you pick a level to play.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.360]   There's your jelly car.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.760]   And you drive it by touching the screen, goes right.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.040]   Oh, I just fired the Jelly Car off into space.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.320]   So let me try that one more time.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.480]   And then it's squishy.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.080]   The accelerometer works.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.480]   So I'm trying to get on this thing here.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.400]   Whoa, oh, I got squished into-- oh, no, oh.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.040]   So you can see there's some physics involved in this as well.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.200]   It is really, really addictive.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.280]   So it's also on graph paper.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.320]   It's almost like these are a genre of stuff, right?
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.040]   You get timed as you try to complete the levels,
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.160]   getting onto the various things.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.080]   That's very hard to do.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.440]   That's why you're doing a radio show.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.400]   So I'll stop right now.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.760]   But it's quite a bit of fun.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.600]   You go backwards, forwards, and then you
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.480]   can tilt the car by using accelerometer.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.640]   And sometimes you have to tilt-- you
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.560]   can even turn it upside down if you play with it enough.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.160]   Jelly Car.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:49.360]   So Scott picks CS4 for the job.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.400]   I take a grown-up application.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.400]   A real serious application.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.200]   And Alex and I pick the toys.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.240]   We like toys.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.640]   I will mention Trism if we're going to talk games.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.680]   Trism is like Tetris kind of.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.560]   All I know is it made the kid that built at 125 grand
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.040]   a month since he launched.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.560]   Oh, that's right.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.000]   I saw that, yeah.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.640]   He's happy.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:10.600]   He's happy.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.920]   The thing that Apple's even saying at this point,
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.840]   forget the PSP, we think the iPhone I
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.960]   touch is a better gaming platform.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.360]   And I have to say, in terms of just the sheer variety
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:25.360]   and ingenuity, I mean, even things like Solitaire and Chess
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.160]   and Sudoku and things like that, this
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.200]   is a really great platform for that.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   The touch interface is excellent.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.400]   So I have a feeling that this may--
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.760]   ironically, the iPhone's real--
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.560]   And the reports are, I think, it's easier to develop for
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.400]   than the PSP.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.320]   Well, they were really smart going with the OS X model
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.000]   instead of some weird OS.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.520]   Because look at the difference between the games developed
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.680]   for the iPod platform and the games developed for the iPhone
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.200]   platform.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.480]   It's like night and day.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.640]   You can really write good games.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.320]   Well, it's a short show today, but that's OK.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.280]   There wasn't a whole lot to talk about.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.680]   We're glad you joined us.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.960]   Alex Lindsay is the head honcho of the Pixel Core.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.040]   You can catch his podcast at pixelport.tv.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.080]   And that includes a Twip, the Sweden photography.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.960]   Scott.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.480]   Sorry.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   The cards run off with the Supermodel, but someday he'll
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.680]   be--
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.280]   I have lots of people competing.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.480]   This would have been a really great day to do video.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.480]   We tried.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:28.480]   We tried.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.360]   I will send you a photograph of what I'm about to get paid to
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:31.680]   do.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.440]   And you'll understand why I'm just a little--
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.080]   Now you're making everybody jealous.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.040]   Is she actually putting lingerie on now?
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.720]   Well, not in front of me.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.560]   OK, never mind.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.200]   But she'll be taking it off later in front of me.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   Oh, stop it.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.400]   Bad, bad, bad.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.720]   I get paid to do these.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.080]   Yeah, sure, sure.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:49.840]   You do it for free.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.080]   We know it.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.360]   I would like to mention that I have started a new blog, not
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:57.120]   a new podcast.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.880]   Alex will start the new podcast when he's ready.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.640]   But I started a new blog called consumervideotips.com.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.920]   Great idea.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.320]   And it's already been somewhat popular.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.400]   Mr. Guy Kawasaki stuck it up on all top already for me.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.200]   Wow, that was fast.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:18.360]   And so we're covering some of these things like the change
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:23.000]   that's coming when you take a look at a D90 with video in it
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.840]   or a 5D Mark II video and how people are going to start using
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:28.040]   this.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.640]   But at the consumer level, knowing that Alex has already
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.480]   got all the Star Wars level people kind of tied up
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.920]   in some kind of show of his.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.360]   If you don't know what the word "node" means related to video,
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.800]   you want to look at my blog nerves.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.560]   It's not for nerves.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.840]   No, if you already know what a node is
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.520]   as it relates to digital compositing,
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.520]   go see something like Alan.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.800]   Yeah, and we're definitely going to get this blog off.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.960]   I can get the podcast off the ground.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.280]   I'm also writing for a blog called
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.160]   provideo coalition.com.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:01.720]   You mentioned that.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.440]   That sounds like fun.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.800]   Yeah, it's a whole bunch of guys--
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.520]   Chris and Trish Myers and a whole bunch of other folks
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.720]   that I've been working with for years.
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:09.080]   And they all started putting together.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.240]   And I kind of watched it build up.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.480]   But now it's really moving.
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.680]   And they asked me to put up my two cents in every once
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.400]   in a while.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.760]   Now, I figure-- we didn't spend any time on Scarlet and Epic.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.760]   And I figure you probably talked a lot about it on Twitch.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.360]   Or did you?
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:21.680]   We did.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:23.360]   That's all we talked about.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:24.280]   That was the red joke.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   Are you kidding me?
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.320]   Yeah, so--
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:29.520]   So anybody wants to know about these new cameras from Red,
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.040]   the Scarlet and the Epic, the cameras that they say
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.920]   will put DSLRs out of business.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.520]   This week in photography is the place to go.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.680]   TwpPhoto.com for a full discussion on that
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.000]   in barrel distortion.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:41.840]   Barrel distortion.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.520]   I can't miss that.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.440]   We had a very long discussion about barrel distortion.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.160]   It's riveting.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:46.680]   Riveting.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.320]   It's very abstruse.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.520]   Yeah, if the rat holes on these subjects weren't enough
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.720]   to completely fill your appetite,
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.880]   then feel free to come listen to ours, which
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.920]   are even longer.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.840]   So at Pixelcore.tv, the podcast, Pixelcore.com
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.960]   is the place to go for the Guild of Multimedia Artists,
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.120]   where you get trained and then get jobs.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.960]   A good time to do that nowadays.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:05.880]   Oh, yes.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.560]   That could be a better business to be in right now.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.640]   And of course, Scott Borne does all those other things.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:15.240]   We've just mentioned and is the mayor of Gig Harbor.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:15.840]   I am not the mayor.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.680]   You should run for mayor, Scott.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.160]   I absolutely have no interest in being the mayor of Gig Harbor.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.560]   You put Gig Harbor on the map, dude.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.440]   Gig Harbor is plenty on the map.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.480]   And I'm fine just being a schmo.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.840]   I just hang out and do my thing and nobody bothers me.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.200]   Chief schmo of Gig Harbor.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:38.520]   I'm happy to just be a person who resides here.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:42.760]   Although I will say that it's a nice little place to live.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.560]   And everybody, all the children above average.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.480]   That's quite true.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.440]   Yes.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.920]   In both income and--
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.680]   --and I had a possession.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:57.160]   It's mostly because we spend $2.7 billion per child
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.680]   in our public school system here.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.320]   That's as it should be.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.040]   I mean, when you try to go past the school here,
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.400]   you can't get past because of the line of Bentley's
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.000]   and Rolls Royce is dropping the kids off.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.440]   And I'm wondering, where is my tax money going?
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.960]   Mintaro says you own the local bank, however.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.520]   I do not own the local bank.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.280]   In fact, thanks to the last couple of months,
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.440]   I might be visiting the local bank for a loan.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.840]   Oh, oh.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.520]   Don't get me started.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.200]   Well, I'll match my losses for yours and tell you what.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.200]   I won't even-- you don't even have to tell me what your ours.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.560]   Yours are, I'll trade.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.760]   I'll trade side on seat.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.480]   No deal.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.840]   Another Mac break, and all its hosts are broke.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:42.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
