[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy Renee and Laurie are all in the show today.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.720]   And boy, we have a lot to talk about, including that Johnny Ive article from The Wall Street Journal.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.760]   Tim Cook's hopping mad about that. We'll talk about what Johnny I've meant to Apple.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.920]   We'll also bring back the newest member of the iPhone family, the iPhone OG.

[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.720]   This is Detroit.

[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.320]   With our three great Apple prognosticators, pressed the digitators,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:33.840]   perspicacious prognosticators. I don't know what you all are. I'm more as Renee Richie is here.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.400]   Hello, I'm more Renee Richie.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.200]   Asio Mac Break, expecto Laporda. I knew you were away because you're playing Wizards Unite. I knew it.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.040]   I don't actually have a confession to make. I declared Pokémon bankruptcy a while ago,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.720]   so I only do the events. Harry Potter is too much of a game for me. I just don't have enough time
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.960]   for it. I'm only on level three, I think. I was doing the Pokémon event yesterday instead.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.880]   It's all yours, Leo.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.040]   We got a Harry Potter event coming up next tomorrow. It's very exciting.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.840]   Excuse me. I have to say hi to Laurie.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.400]   Laurie Gillis also with I'm where she's managing editor there. You're playing Harry Potter,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.880]   I hope. Yes, I am. I'm very excited about tomorrow's event too. I need a lot of the
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.240]   restricted books for my profession. I'm a professor profession. I need like 100.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.360]   You need like 100 restricted books. Tomorrow is where you're going to get the books.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.040]   We're doing our skill tree. We're building up our skills. I know we're nearly smart enough for
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.280]   this game. It's a much more elaborate game than Pokémon Go, but as we've mentioned before,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.840]   it's on the same platform. I'm a toddler. You guys are in university.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.200]   What level are you? That was a nice trace. That was a good job.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.840]   I'm getting better at these. Practice makes perfect.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.240]   It's still pretty bad. The wand chooses the wizard, Harry.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   Is that baby Groot? Are you attacking me?
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.560]   It looks like Groot. Isn't that funny? It's not a Groot.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.240]   This game is highly addictive. I can't stop playing it. It's a lot of fun.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.280]   You're right. It is much more complicated. There's lots more to it.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.880]   I didn't even realize. I noticed all the ins looked different, but I didn't realize what they
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.080]   were. They're all real ins from the books and so forth. There I got Groot.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.440]   It is baby Groot. It looks great on that screen, Leo.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.480]   Edge to edge to edge.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.080]   Can you think of what phone this might be based on the screen?
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.000]   I can't tell if the camera tilts up at an angle or flips all the way around.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.680]   Oh, you are so smart.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.680]   Yeah, that's the giveaway watch. Well, actually, let's do it in Harry Potter.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.200]   If I decide I want to change my wizard's appearance here and probably should, given that
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.320]   that is my picture, I have to turn on the camera and whoop, it emerges from the top.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.760]   Isn't that so? It's not an Asus Flipo.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.320]   It's a little periscope camera. What I like about it is that as a result, the screen
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.920]   has no holes in it. It's edge to edge. It's great for Harry Potter because there's,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.600]   as A.V.E. would say, it's got a choo-chir what lifts up the camera.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.560]   A choo-chir?
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.480]   Come up. A choo-chir what lifts up the camera.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.840]   What lifts up the camera there?
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.160]   Anyway, so what level are you at, Ms. Gill?
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.480]   I'm a 10.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.360]   Professor Gill.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.440]   Actually, I had to stop playing for a couple of days because I went over my
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.160]   cellular limit three times. Here's a pro tip.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.560]   Download your assets on Wi-Fi. Do you know about that?
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.920]   Yeah, I do.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.920]   Because if you don't do that, it's really at the bottom here.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.280]   Download all assets.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.920]   Seriously, the best of you feature in iOS 13 is it goes into low bandwidth mode when you're
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.840]   tethering now. I have shapes.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.560]   Very cool.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.280]   Yeah, if you download your assets, that also speeds up networks and networking and all that
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.400]   stuff. I noticed they haven't had the problems Pokemon goes ahead.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.320]   So far, yeah.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.800]   Even Pokemon goes still having them, which is sad.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.760]   Either that means nobody's playing this game, which is possible.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.120]   I don't think it's quite got the uptake Pokemon go did in the first week.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.800]   They had a massive outage in Europe for the event on Sunday.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.600]   Oh, they did?
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.240]   The Pokemon.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.040]   Oh.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.480]   They had to raise and start for 15 minutes and then people were getting network errors.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.680]   Well, we'll find out our first event is tomorrow, but it's a week long event.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   It's not actually not our first event.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.480]   There was one last week, but anyway, it'll be fun.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.600]   It'll be fun to play.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.200]   We'll get Andy playing that everyone will be happy.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.440]   Andy, Andy, Andy Inako is also here.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.080]   He wouldn't be playing the silly child's game.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.400]   No, no. I've actually have become addicted to this hot new collectable card game.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.680]   It's called Mule Born.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.560]   Road racing.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.760]   Actually, I love your born.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.640]   Apparently, it's just been.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.600]   It's.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.240]   I love it.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.840]   No, no, it's from Milton Bradley.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.760]   1954.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.240]   So it's been.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.520]   Although there are no digital versions.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.680]   There's a there's a Tantan version that's really fun to play.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.440]   I just see.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.760]   I actually just remembered it from my childhood and it bought like a set a few days ago to have
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.800]   run the house just in case.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.280]   Yeah, it's fun.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.560]   But yeah, but you know, recently I figured out the thing that takes the place of gaming for me,
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:28.320]   like like phone games and stuff is like coming home from like just a day out with like 500 pictures
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.600]   of which three are kind of okay and then trying to make the three of them that are kind of okay.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.200]   That's a good game.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.720]   That's a grown up game.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.560]   No, no, no, it's not better.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.080]   It's not where it's just I realized that that's the that's my oh god.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.600]   I really don't want to work.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.320]   What can I do to kill a little time before I really have to work?
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.720]   I know.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.920]   I'll try to fix that picture of the the the the natural gas shipment.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.240]   Portal containers at the Boston Harbor that I saw from the ferry coming home on Sunday.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.040]   Yay.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.840]   I'm actually.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   I'm actually.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.200]   And I don't like a joke about them being being kaiju eggs and posted on this.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.320]   Actually, actually at the it sounds like something he actually did, folks.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.440]   I could tell and he doesn't make no, it's it's it's on the side.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.160]   Did you do that?
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.840]   I don't necessarily grab this morning.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.080]   Including the comment the crack about the kaiju eggs.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.040]   I am actually of the opinion now with the with the new iPadOS features,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.680]   the ability to import directly into Lightroom pixel mator photo, which is the
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.920]   the five we talked about last week, the bomb program for photo editing.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.440]   I am now thinking that I can on my trips not bring a laptop.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.280]   I can bring my iPad pro and I would mark has could travel together so nicely.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.960]   Now he did a whole thing on living with the iPad and he finally conclude.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.440]   That's the right way to go or I did mine to and everything except for final cup pro.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.800]   I'm perfectly happy on and I think his was the same thing as he does.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.400]   He edits he won't even edit on a Mac book.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.240]   He edits on a yeah, I'm a pro but everything sort of final cup pro.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.760]   I'm doing on an iPad pro these days.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:04.880]   And for the kind of editing I do frankly, I could easily use iMovie without a problem.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.760]   There's other good choices.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.160]   What is that?
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.880]   Luma.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.360]   Luma.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.160]   Yeah, Luma Fusion.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.360]   Really good.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.840]   Jonathan Morrison edited a whole his full iPad video on the iPad using Luma Fusion.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.440]   It was better than anything I ever made in my life.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:24.160]   I'm thinking it's the it's it really is going to become more and more the choice for creation
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.080]   as well as for content consumption.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.040]   I'm really I'm so excited about iPadOS.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.440]   Let's start though with the big story of the week.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.200]   And it's a little old by the time we got around to it because this came out after the show last week.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.320]   They waited.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:38.960]   They waited.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:48.640]   Johnny Ive is leaving Apple and the hot take from John Gruber I think to me remains the best hot take.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:55.280]   His last sentence of his piece is I don't worry that Apple's in trouble because Johnny Ive is leaving.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.200]   I worry that Apple's in trouble because he's not being replaced.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.040]   John has walked that I got him on my show and he got Ben Thompson on his show on Friday and he has
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.160]   he has I think he said his words where he regretted that part of it.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.240]   He's walked it back a little bit and in fact that the Wall Street Journal article that said Johnny I was
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.600]   leaving because he just didn't get no respect is apparently.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.040]   It's a very bad knock-out article.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:30.160]   It's apparently really irritated Tim Cook. Tim sent a message to Dylan Byers from NBC News
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.280]   saying hi Dylan hope you're well talking about I guess Dylan must have asked him about the Wall
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:41.200]   Street Journal story. The story is absurd. A lot of the reporting and certainly the conclusions just
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.960]   don't match with reality at a base level. I always worry about this exact problem with our coverage
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.320]   too at the base level shows a lack of understanding about how the design team works and how Apple works.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.000]   We who are not inside Apple have a very different view of what's going on inside Apple than those
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.600]   who are there of course of necessity and that's true of every organization that's just an inherent
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.840]   flaw in reporting. It distorts the email then you can tell me it distorts relationships
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.400]   decisions and events to the point that we just don't recognize the company it claims to describe.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.960]   The design team is phenomenally talent as Johnny has said they're stronger than ever and I have
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.240]   complete confidence that they will thrive under Jeff Jeff Williams who's now the COO now in charge
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.480]   of the design team. Evan's Hankey who is also a design team member and worked closely with Johnny
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.120]   I've and Allen's leadership. We know the truth. We know the incredible things they're capable of
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.480]   doing the projects they're working on will blow you away with every with every with every
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:48.400]   things that last sentence which is kind of classic Tim Cook marketing speak. I would say this is
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.440]   very credible this this sounds yeah this reads right to me which is that the journals reporting
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:59.200]   wasn't wrong but that it's hard to understand what it's like inside a company and how the structure
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.720]   is when you're looking from the outside. Go ahead Renee. Yeah no I was gonna say is because I had
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.520]   the exact same thing is you and I happen to know some people on that team and as soon as that came
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.120]   out and I'm sure you can speak to other people who know people at Apple who tell you the same thing
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.040]   it just didn't jive with what I'd heard from them over the years and I asked you said you know
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.960]   these stories didn't happen and I'm like sick to my stomach right now and I don't know how I'm
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.720]   gonna spend my weekend and that's like a horrible position for that and they can't go on record
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   they are not allowed to go on record unless Apple PR allows them to an Apple PR I don't think we'll
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:35.760]   let them do that so what I did was I talked to Miley Quo who was at Apple until a couple of years
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.480]   ago and she was on the design and prototyping team and I put live 30-minute interview with her
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:47.360]   this morning where she actually describes how those teams work and why operations is so essential
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   and I think the key part that both the journal missed with their flippant exit thing and some of
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.640]   the early analysis missed is that Jeff Williams isn't running operations at Apple anymore he's
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.760]   been replaced in that role by a new senior vice president Jeff is now effectively helping run
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.560]   Apple like the way that Tim Cook used to help Steve run Apple and Jeff is way more interested
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:13.600]   in the day-to-day product development process than Tim's time allows him to be and so you have now
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:20.000]   a vice president of industrial design who is amazing and Miley talks about how I'm a she just
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.800]   says that you know Evans gets s stuff done and you Alan Dye has been leading human interface since
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.240]   iOS 7 these are seasoned leaders Apple doesn't just give away SVP titles I wouldn't be surprised if
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.120]   one or somebody got that title but for now putting them with Jeff Williams makes a lot of sense to
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.240]   anybody who understands how Apple is running design these days and it gives you two separate
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.440]   heads which is what people were complaining about for years under Johnny yes I mean that's
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.880]   I can't improve upon that but I'm going to talk anyway because I'm bored
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.520]   but that's that's that's exactly my reaction to I don't think that my contacts inside the design
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:06.320]   team are nearly as rich as as as Renee's but my immediate reaction was none of what I've seen in
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:13.520]   this article corresponds to what I understand the situation inside the design team to be none of
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.640]   what none of what I've seen this jibes with what I've heard about Johnny Ives relationship with the
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.400]   rest of the executive team and so I was when I saw this come out I was really waiting for
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.000]   either they've totally got it wrong or they got it right which means that over the weekend we're
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.080]   going to hear from a lot of former members of employees of Apple who are now safely outside of
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.280]   Apple and no longer restricted by NDA or anything who will who have been had who will almost certainly
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:47.360]   have had pent up feelings about this that they wouldn't just simply make a medium blog post just
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.000]   to air dirty laundry but hey if there's a Wall Street Journal article that's finally blowing the lid
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.120]   off this big problem that's when you see lots of other people suddenly raise their hand to say yeah
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.840]   let me tell you a story that I've been holding on to for a few years that really shows the problem
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.560]   that the Wall Street Journal finally thank god for the journal has illustrated and we're really
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.880]   not seeing that and I can and I absolutely and knowing about the how passionate things are
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.720]   people are inside of Apple I can absolutely believe that there's a lot of heartbreak
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.000]   going on to see this article particularly because as when I said you can't then go on to Twitter
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.720]   and say hi I worked for Apple hi I've been working intimately with this team for years and boy this
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:32.320]   is a no you can't because you have to go through Apple PR and given that this was supposed to be
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:40.080]   sort of a valid victory for one of the if you were to come up with a list of five let's make it 10
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:46.720]   names of Apple employees including founders who are critical to Apple being in the position it is
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:52.880]   today Johnny I was definitely on on that list of 10 people and this really should be
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:58.480]   like a lifetime achievement award sort of thing like of the we're going to it should be like David
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.880]   Letterman's last show this should be let's just tell stories about how how wonderful not only his
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.480]   work but his work with the design team has been and but now it's been sort of tainted by well now
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:17.680]   we were kind of now we have this really big intestinal gaseous emission that's now clouding
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.280]   the room that we have to now ventilate before we can get back to wishing Johnny I have well and
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.800]   talking about how design works at Apple so I could I'm I kind of feel bad for people inside of Apple
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.840]   having to deal with right now and again if it turned if if this if all the people who have similar
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.960]   stories from experience at Apple have been waiting almost a full week to talk about them
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.760]   I'll apologize for having jumped to a conclusion but yeah I don't think this this doesn't seem
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.600]   credible at all Laurie I think that's the problem with the nature of the internet
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:55.280]   and the immediacy of reporting these stories that this this is a editorial piece or a sort of deep
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:01.360]   research piece that would have needed a week to get done and to get done right and to get all the
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.960]   right voices in because I'm sure there are a lot of people that either do work for or used to work
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:13.440]   for Apple that have certain sentiments but this didn't have enough voices outside of one directive
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.400]   and because of the immediacy of trying to get this out there to the public because you know we're
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:26.000]   constantly digesting this information like immediately it lost the opportunity to have deeper voices
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.640]   even the opportunity to speak with with Apple PR to sort of like negate some of these these
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:38.960]   statements and some of the things that were said so you almost can't blame news organizations
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:46.160]   though you can blame news organizations no you can't do it wrong what I'm saying is like it
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.680]   it's almost not a surprise to me that they got it wrong because they're they're trying so hard
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   to do it fast that they're not doing the work to do it right you know you're not you're too
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:03.120]   young to remember Time magazine but this is a I'm not but thank you well the old not the current
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:11.280]   time in my age in my era 40 years 30 or 40 years ago this is a style that was created by Time magazine
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.120]   of the of the birds I view inside the organization style and you could tell as soon as you read the
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.080]   lead from the Wall Street Journal as the deadline loom for the 10th anniversary iPhone software
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.800]   designers gathered in the penthouse of an exclusive San Francisco club called the battery they've been
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:32.400]   signing goes on it's the fly in the wall reporting that's very compelling for readers because it
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.080]   puts you inside but it has that flaw no matter what and I don't I'm maybe I'm sure they had many
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.120]   sources for this but it has that flaw no matter what that you really can't be a fly on a wall that
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.240]   organizations are complex understanding them from within that requires being within and nobody on
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.800]   the outside can really get enough information to tell the right story so I think that that's
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.560]   where I would blame the Wall Street Journal worry because they're they're adopting this fly in the
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:05.200]   wall style whereas I think I would stand by what John Gruber wrote even if he won't and and what
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.000]   we've said because we're not observing we're not trying to think of what's we're not saying
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.080]   what's going on inside of Apple we're observing it as Apple customers and Apple users and Apple
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.880]   journalists from the outside here's the impact from the outside and what's been apparent from the
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:27.040]   outside for many years is that Johnny I've I don't know how many times he shows up inside Apple Park
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:33.760]   but it's been apparent he's kind of been distant from the whole process you don't see him on stage
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.800]   well you never saw him on stage but you don't see him in the videos you don't
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.920]   you know you don't see him in the you saw him at the event at WWDC with Tim kind of looking at the
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:48.480]   computer but it's not the same involvement as in the Steve Jobs era and so it doesn't and nothing
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.920]   I read in the journal surprise and it can't be the jobs is gone it's Lenin and McCartney man and
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.200]   and Lenin died the one thing though the one thing I really want to talk to what both you and Lori
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.400]   said is that the journal said they spent a year on this and I don't doubt that they did I don't
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.800]   doubt that they work really hard on it but it hits me like that big hack story hit me which
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.840]   not coincidentally is the only other time Apple so far has seen fit to really publicly hit back
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:17.520]   against a publication and that is it seems like like I'm sure there are people like Lori said that
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.400]   are not happy with how things were how things are how things will be there always you can never make
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.160]   everybody happy but it seems like this the events and the narrative were specifically constructed to
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.680]   match what the journal wanted to say and it wasn't there wasn't a bigger representation
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.360]   and the journal for a while now when you read what they actually write it's the beleaguered
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.400]   iPhone 10r doesn't matter that apple says selling iPhone right now it's beleaguered the
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.280]   appra the apple watch isn't a isn't a good product even though it had the second fastest ramp up
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:52.320]   since iPad and is selling more than iPod did it as high everything is presented in a negative light
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.840]   there's very there's very little other and I know people who were at those meetings and said that
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.920]   some of that stuff just absolutely never happened yeah and if I can find that out
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.480]   and the thing that bothered me the most is both with Gruber's story and with this article
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:10.080]   people in tech media were so fast to retweet it and say must read I think this is 100% accurate
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.880]   and it's literally our jobs to be skeptical and say can I like when one source publishes
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.280]   you're supposed to go and find corroborating stuff and either back it up or disprove it
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.080]   that's it's but it's not that it's like Gruber would have something negative about apple amplify amplify
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.240]   this is negative about apple and like the and the stories that are positive don't get anywhere
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.040]   or even just balanced or neutral or informative don't get anywhere near the amplification and it
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.600]   creates a real disbalance I think for for the entire market so yeah but but let me so so we
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:45.680]   don't have to dissect this it was a okay fine it was a bad piece uh i'm more interested in
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.040]   well for instance uh you mentioned Alan Dye has been in charge of human interface design since
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.960]   iOS 7 do we blame Alan Dye for iOS 8?
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.640]   I mean it depends on how you want to blame it if there's issues with human interface like I
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.280]   blame them iOS 8 was a nightmare human interface you couldn't tell if a button was clickable or not
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.600]   there was all sorts of issues I think seven was the was the big problem they've been walking it back
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.320]   seven they did in a very short schedule and they went way too far they're like iOS 6 was
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.760]   way too far in photorealism and the reaction so they went way too far in different authenticity
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.680]   and ever since then they would try to fix that but they killed usability I mean they actively I
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:30.240]   mean they really made it they made it up it was a a botch up and at the time I thought this is why
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:36.080]   you don't make Johnny I've responsible for all for hardware and software which is what apple had
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.720]   done they need attention you need to like and the more minimal you make the hardware the less
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.920]   minimal you're allowed to make the software because people need compassion they need consideration
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.640]   and you have to fight like the more you take away the more glass you give people the way more
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.280]   your software has to do to help them I think that's exactly right so that was one issue and then
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:02.720]   the other issue that I don't know if I blame sir Johnny or not but this drive towards thinner
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:10.880]   has really I think created dysfunctional design you pour battery and the blood butterfly keyboard
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:17.600]   so in all honesty when I hear Johnny I was leaving I'm thinking okay sir Johnny knobs on everything
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.720]   sir Johnny is a great designer but let's now give us a chance to give us a new keyboard a
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:28.560]   thicker design with battery battery life and ports and maybe we went too far down the design path
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:35.200]   let's go back to baroque revival just nothing but like cupids and flowers and gold leaf on every
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:41.120]   single surface yeah but that's see the the way that apple works and it's it really works with
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.080]   teams and there's a very very visible face leading these teams and those are the ones that get the
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:51.680]   video in front of the the white void or get the slots during the keynotes so I don't think that
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:58.320]   will be quite as radical a shift as we as some of us might hope in terms of people who again hate
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:04.320]   super super super thin three thousand dollar laptops but it would be I think I we talked about
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:11.840]   this a few weeks ago where I really do hope that this that the attitudes of the design team are not
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:18.640]   so homogenous that you can't have someone say okay you know this idea of having a red apple logo
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:24.400]   in the corner of every laptop that I got shouted down on every single time guess what we're ordering
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.360]   pizza burritos and vegetarian salads we're gonna stay in this conference room until somebody beats
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.440]   me senseless and makes me stop trying to revive this idea I would I would love to see that kind of
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:42.560]   a revolution in design because as lovely as the macbooks are aesthetic objects I do think they're
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.040]   kind of boring they're not as exciting as they as new designs used to be there certainly not as
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:53.360]   exciting as a new mac pro has been over the past two iterations but I don't think we're going to
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   see that kind of revolution because it was a team the team has sort of a group aesthetic there's a
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.720]   reason why when you see a new coke logo it doesn't look that far away from the old coke logo it's
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.160]   because this is this is our design language this is our theme and you don't just throw it away if
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.680]   it's working as it is I think there's also a risk this great man psychology which is we're all as
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:22.720]   humans we're we're very focused on human psychology so it's a natural thing but you see it in history
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.960]   as well as in journalism and everything else in any attempt to understand human affairs
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:33.600]   it's the it's the person it's the it's the johnny ives but but everyone knows a company as big as
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:39.440]   apple it's many many people in this many many factors and it isn't it isn't uh you know it's
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:44.480]   not just johnny and tim deciding what to do right there's something that's johnny and jennie
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:53.440]   of death by committee though that you know if i think rene had had talked about previously that
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:25:00.640]   a an android color and help me remember this conversation blue that there was like an eternal
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.560]   voting on on the color scheme and they came up with something google google uh had a hard time i
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.800]   think paying the painlessly yeah yeah and then remember but remember steve jobs calling up uh
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.760]   eric schmidt or was it eric schmidt or was it larry page i think was eric schmidt no it was what's
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.600]   his name on the guy who left and went to the chinese company um the guy who said that steve
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.680]   jobs was a tyrant who couldn't be allowed to control the future of phones right called him up at
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:32.880]   church and says uh you know this color that in your app on my iphone on my iphone is wrong yellow
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:39.680]   so i completely agree with you there is a good point to be made lory that designed by committee
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.080]   just as a movie by committee or a novel by committee is is going to be bland and nothing
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.320]   it takes a vision or it could be it does it doesn't mean it is it just means that it could be and
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.920]   you like being a part of like the music industry where you know there's there's incredibly creative
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.440]   people that by themselves right the beginning middle end and all the parts to songs and some of
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   those are some of the best songs that have ever been created and then there's groups of people
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:11.120]   where the band decides as a group whether or not they want to sound a certain sound or you know
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:16.560]   if they want to throw in a third chorus and and they together decide that and sometimes that leaves
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:22.000]   that creativity flat where what would start it out to be something great gets washed away because
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.240]   too many people get to participate in the decision of it yeah that's the the kind of argument to
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.880]   uh say that sort of stuff as always you mentioned that you would mention that casablanca when the
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.400]   best films ever made was he very much a studio production where there were 100 hands on it and
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:44.960]   100 opinions going into it and it's not it's so it's not necessarily that the decision by committee
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:51.840]   is a terrible thing also as much fun as we've put as we've been poking at uh certain things that
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.320]   we don't like about maybe the new Mac Pro certain things that the entire universe didn't like about
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.960]   the previous Mac Pro you can't say that those were boring designs those weren't cookie cutter
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.760]   wrote designs even when and even when they were challenged to say okay the Quaker
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.080]   Roats content concept did not fly for anybody except for the people who threw it through the
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.800]   window because they couldn't upgrade it after three or four years so we were going to make a box
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.760]   that is filled with spaces that people can upgrade themselves even when tasked with the problem of
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:25.280]   let's create a box that people can fill with drives and ram or whatever they want let's make a really
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:33.520]   cool double wall cheese grater new design with spacecraft feet on it I don't so I don't if that's
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.920]   designed by committee that shows that they can design some pretty cool stuff with a bunch of
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.360]   intelligent people all focused on the same goal they've got a great team Ben Thompson also a big
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.280]   difference go ahead Renee I was gonna say there's also a big difference between what happened with
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   iOS 7 and now basically Steve Jobs loved the photorealism stuff and Scott Forestall was amazing at
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.800]   at implementing that for him but Scott and Johnny and Scott and other people did not get along and
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.600]   the company just could not contain both of them could not continue with both of them so ultimately
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:09.600]   Johnny won out and Scott left and Johnny took over and he and Alan died comes from a graphic
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.400]   design background like I think like print style graphic design and they both went a totally
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.040]   different direction as far as I know you know Tim has never said minimal minimal minimal and
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.880]   Johnny was just implemented to get in everybody else at Apple was like no it must be maximal and
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:28.320]   now that Johnny's gone they're like maximize maximize we probably won't see you know a ton of like
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.120]   we won't see like a Nokia phone bubble up out of Apple design immediately but it's like children
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.320]   you'll have some children who rebel against the taste of their parents and some children who
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.760]   want to make those parents proud and hopefully because you know the person took over Evans Henke
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.560]   she is much more of a manager and Richard Holworth who had taken over last time but ultimately decided
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:52.000]   he much preferred the design part he is very much a designer and to me you know she's super
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.520]   practical he did the iPhone 10 he's only got the chops that is a really good team until and she's
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.840]   a really good leader to get them not just where they need to go but where they can go in the future
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:08.240]   so I don't so I'm now going to indulge in exactly the thing I said we shouldn't indulge in but I
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:15.280]   but I'm going to point to a Ben Thompson it's indulging yeah Ben Thompson's trajectory article
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:24.640]   in which he says I saw this coming four years ago he said there was a series of PR strokes master
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.840]   strokes by Apple including a profile of Johnny I have in the New Yorker a Wired article this is
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:36.080]   in 2014 about the design of the Apple Watch which is just emerging and then the promotion of I have
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:46.320]   to Chief Design Officer giving Hawarth and Die managerial duties he wrote then this is in 2014
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.400]   taken as a whole this entire episode as a masterful display of public relations
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:30:00.880]   basically starting to usher I've out the door he said you can't you can't be half in half out
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:06.240]   I was half out so that means he has to be all the way out now that was 2014 he wasn't right as
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:13.680]   terms of the timeline what do you think of this compare this profile of I've by Ian Parker
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:21.200]   it's so good I thought it was quite good this is 2015 New Yorker to what the Wall Street Journal
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.880]   wrote they he apparently they got a lot of access right they he spent a lot of time with Ive and
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:32.000]   so forth and it's a bit like the the only thing like I think Ben has done like both Ben's podcast
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.080]   with Gruber and the article he wrote that one and I think the follow up our great the only thing
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.880]   I'm not sure of is whether it was once Stephen John Steve John's passed away if it was it was
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:45.200]   probably inevitable that Johnny was gonna leave but I don't know if it was active in that we have
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:49.600]   to figure out how to get Johnny out the door in five years or it's let's do everything we can to
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.440]   help Johnny's day even if we know that's might not work that makes more sense like let's give him
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:00.400]   fewer duties let's pay him more a lot more yeah let's let him do that 17,000 watch that's good Johnny
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.040]   over yeah that book is fine yeah and then but even though you know in your heart it's not gonna work
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.160]   yeah yeah and not only that but remember the project red projects auction items he did like the
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:17.280]   table and the the gold air air broads it was that if I would not have predicted this because that's
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:22.160]   a mugs game but the thing that I think I said a few years ago when he changed titles when we he
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.400]   we started seeing him doing these other projects is I just noted that there are a lot I know I
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.680]   think we all know people who are very very very high functioning in their careers where you can
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:37.280]   make it to the very very top at Apple you can make it you can become an astronaut you can become
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.640]   the greatest artist in the world you can become you can work on like all of the Star Wars movies
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.760]   at ILM and be considered one of the critical people in terms of design and special effects but there
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:53.360]   is something about certain kinds of minds that you just get ants in your pants where it's I've I feel
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.760]   as though I've done stuff I've made I've done lots of really great stuff at ILM but now I really
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:05.680]   want to do other stuff that ILM doesn't do or yes it was it was great doing like three spacewalks
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.000]   but now I kind of I kind of feel like well I'm not going to be able to do this for another 10 years
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.400]   and I'm kind of interested in painting right now just like Alan Bean he was an astronaut he
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.200]   quit being an astronaut more or less to become a painter there are kind there was kinds of creative
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.720]   brains where no matter it's not as though I'm gonna I'm gonna stay in this one place and keep
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.600]   doing this job that I've been doing for 20 years until the day I die and that at that there was a
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:33.200]   point a few years ago where I thought that I wonder if Johnny I was going to have is changing his role
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:39.200]   so that he can use his brain on other design projects would be this the idea of him doing a
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:45.680]   design studio is fascinating because I just want to see other things that he designs I really want
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.240]   to see him do like a silverware pattern yeah he might be tired of technology might say yeah I
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   want to do something different yeah I don't and it's a great send act a great children's author the
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.320]   guy wrote where the wild things are yeah told once told me that you should change your career every
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:04.400]   10 years he did he became an opera set designer uh ramsies looked upon his work right Leo yeah
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.520]   he's looked upon his breadth of his empire and wept yeah Alexander reached the sea he repped
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.760]   wept where there were no lands left to conquer yeah it's sometimes you just it's good you know
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.640]   that's why I just want to announce I'm going to become a potter uh Harry pottery
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.720]   pottering around you're marrying into the potter family into the potter family yeah he means we farm
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:33.040]   everybody he's just to polite to say it go ahead Larry it's so Johnny I was transitioned this this
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:39.520]   is like what we all want to do right like we want to become the absolute best at that one job that
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:45.040]   we've done and be so good at it that we can easily just drop it and move on to something else and
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.160]   and we're so known for what we've done that we can do anything yeah he's just doing perfect you know
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:57.600]   are we envious of of him just doing exactly what is the perfect thing to be able to do in life is
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.400]   move on because now you can because you did it all and you're ready for something new and because
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:08.160]   you're so good at it everybody wants to throw money at you to continue what you're doing in a new way
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:14.240]   you know that nobody wants to just like quit their high paying job to start an unknown business not
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.040]   knowing whether or not they're gonna make a dollar at it and and he's able to do something like that
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:26.080]   because of obviously having a lot of money to begin with but also knowing that who he is is going to
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:32.720]   help forward this this new endeavor no matter what so it's it's really kind of a great situation I
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.280]   think all of us wish we could be in yeah and he was so burned out after the watch like he just by
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:43.040]   all accounts that was the hardest thing you ever had to ship makes sense I mean these things are
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.520]   these products are big pushes there's a lot of work it's a hard thing to do so he'll be missed but
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.680]   I think also new blood is always a good thing and I think maybe we'll see I would love to see
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.520]   some new directions from Apple and their hardware design not necessarily we're saying Corellian
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.200]   like something like the Millennium Falcon that would be a great design language to explore
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:08.320]   but I mean the Macbooks haven't been redesigned in four years right they could use a radar dish yeah
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:14.640]   the and a tour it a couple of tours iPhone is is pretty close to the platonic ideal of a smartphone
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:20.080]   everybody because everybody's copying it but maybe there's somewhere else to go with this and
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   getting some fresh eyes on it's not a bad idea and for other companies it's almost it was that
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.920]   running joke that Apple was sort of he was the unofficial design lead of almost every electronics
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.600]   company at one point or another sort of like Peter Rams or you know this there's just some
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.960]   people that their stuff is so influential he created and it would be nice if people were like oh
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.960]   like let's see what we can do in a post-iv era we're gonna be first this time Apple screw you guys
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:46.800]   let me let me take this iPhone out of its case so I could just show you this is the one plus
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:55.600]   seven pro this is the iPhone 10s Max those colors are almost identical it's it couldn't be I mean
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.160]   it's clear that and I should get out the galaxy as 10 same thing if I put these on a table side by
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.400]   side I'd have to really look closely if you didn't work in the industry yeah I mean I know the
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.680]   difference is because one has a pop-up camera but I mean let me let me put this next one one has a
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:20.320]   notch other has a hole punch yeah I mean honestly this these are there so it's kind of done well
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.440]   playing devil's advocate once you get to the point of we've removed all the buttons from the front
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.560]   and the design aesthetic is to not is to make it a rounded rectangle with a front that's all
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:35.200]   screened and has some cameras in the back oh and by the way whenever material you build the
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:41.920]   back out if it has to be invisible to radio waves so that it won't interfere with the with the antenna
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:47.440]   and it can also it can also do wireless charging I'm not necessarily sure they're doing the command
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:56.880]   C command V oh no I'm not but yeah but clearly the design look look at the the side bezel you know
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:04.320]   the the rims there's no engineering you know magic there they're identical so yes of course
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.840]   Andy you're driven by design is driven by engineering but to the degree that a designer
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:15.280]   could influence that Johnny I was the king so I think I think the better example is after the
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:20.320]   bond I blew I'm at came out and after when the second generation came out and now there's they
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:28.720]   bank the same translucent half case that has multiple colors I I'm not kidding to attention
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:34.240]   youths who are listening to the show I'm not joking here I remember going into like the
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.560]   appliance department of an apartment store and their work their were department stores back then
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.520]   and seeing you could get like a George Foreman like kitchen good like I'm gonna stop you head
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:51.200]   I'm gonna stop you there because I know in fact this is 1998 when we got that bond I blew we went
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:58.480]   out and bought a vacuum cleaner we bought a dozen different appliances that predated the iMac
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.880]   and put them side by side so I don't think they were copying the bond I blew iMac there was a
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:11.120]   design ethos in the air and you could just as well say that that bond I blew iMac copied a vacuum
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.480]   cleaner I will kill vacuum club remember that a vacuum cleaner has a translucent component to
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.240]   begin with because you know you don't you don't justify the expense if you don't see all the all
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.120]   the junk and hair and dust and stuff going in there I'm talking I'm talking about but what how do you
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:30.160]   make and this is I do remember this after two years after the original iMac why do you make a
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:37.440]   countertop George Foreman grill that has a translucent plastic component to the top of it that are
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:44.800]   available in like four or five lifesavers colors I do think that they were influenced by by the iMac
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.600]   even though they didn't I certainly didn't invent translucency and bright colors but i'm telling
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:56.400]   you I think you had a dozen uh home appliances that okay free dated that mac so I don't I don't
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:03.120]   I don't this maybe George Foreman did copy it but I could there was already a design trend that
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:09.760]   that Johnny very much was influenced by I would like a copy I could I could be wrong because this is
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.640]   this is the same fallacy that all consumers tend to fall into but their designers are looking at
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.960]   everything whereas consumers are just looking at things that they see on shelves this this is this
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:25.040]   is why I'm always my my usual like humorous rebuttal to people especially during the Samsung trial
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.480]   about say you see you can't deny that they have the unique the iPhone was a totally unique thing
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.880]   with you know rounded a square of rectangular device with rounded corners and a centered home
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:40.080]   button and then I just simply had to go into that drawer in my office and pull out like palm
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:46.800]   pilots and windows CE devices that were all the iPhones with rounded rectangles with one big fat
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:53.760]   home button in the middle so much brawn isn't so much apple yeah yeah and what was what was the
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.480]   the pocket radio that seemed to have inspired the the iPod but that but that but that was more of a
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:05.520]   specific quote that the design team was making there as opposed to like being influenced there's
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.440]   there's there's between doing a specific homage saying this is a really great idea let's do this
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:15.200]   in a modern context I wish I could find an image of our set because we oh and someone was posting
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.760]   mark new sums stuff that looks exactly like the mac pro you know the 2013 macro that you have
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:26.560]   it's the cylinder for mark new sums collection nobody's working in a vacuum right so to speak
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:33.680]   maybe they're with the vacuum but there's you you have to you have to keep in mind to the hardware
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:41.840]   design it it works with the software design there might be you know a galaxy phone that looks almost
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:47.360]   identical to an iPhone but the software that goes into the iPhone is also what makes that aesthetic
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:53.440]   feel a lot better to those of us who are iOS users versus Android users and Android users probably
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.320]   feel the same way and Leo you're you're someone that that goes back and forth between both and
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:03.360]   I'm not sure if you prefer one aesthetic over the other but those are all taken into consideration
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.560]   to not just the hardware design but the people who do all the work to make the software that works
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:14.640]   with that hardware you know need to need to get their recognition to absolutely actually that's one
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.920]   thing that one plus has has done really well because they don't use stock Android they have a
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:26.400]   version of Andrew Coloxigen and it is very clearly designed to go with the phone this phone is kind
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.960]   of interesting because it is a 90 Hertz refresh rate and so yeah and it has a very high res screen
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.840]   and very nice I would say it's actually I had for a long time said the s10 plus is the best screen
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.160]   I ever used because I like these OLED screens and Samsung probably keeps the best for themselves but
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:47.200]   somehow one plus got a got one up on well wasn't there a company that took Samsung's technology
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:52.960]   and started refactoring it in China I forget the name probably probably this is stolen Samsung but
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.840]   that but that's you're exactly right Laurie it's a whole and that was one thing that I think
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.280]   Johnny said from day one and one of the reasons they put Johnny in charge of all design and Apple
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:09.840]   including software design was it should be a whole it should be an entity yeah and Apple is and is
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.000]   particular is a very particular case amongst tech companies so that there are very few companies
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.560]   that I'm where I have really real knowledge of that they really do integrate as one whole team
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.920]   where the every single every single person of high responsibility is very aware of everything
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:32.720]   that everything everybody else is doing and and so that's why OS works very well with hardware
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:38.000]   which works very well with APIs which works very well with services because you don't have a
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.880]   different you don't have different divisions that seem to be competing each other competing with
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:48.160]   each other for budgets and for the CEOs attention and for marketing money I'm sure that there's
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:54.080]   a competition inside of Apple but inside I've never seen a company that seems to have a
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:43:01.200]   collective version of focus that is as finally highly tuned as as Apple so
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.760]   let's put a point in this conversation because I'm starving and I think my door dash is arrived
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:12.080]   if you don't want to know I'm starving tip your delivery driver always tip your delivery driver
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:20.080]   door dash awesome we are very happy oh look go ahead you let me give you a let me give you a tip
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:26.800]   young lady for bringing me that thank you very much she's not my dasher but hey this is really
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.360]   exciting a brand new sponsor on the show and and it's I always like to have sponsors with products
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.960]   that we use all the time I know door dash very well for a couple of reasons one because at least
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:43.200]   here in Petaluma door dash has the largest number of choices for restaurants door dash's job is to
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:48.320]   connect you to your favorite restaurants in your city and they do a hell of a job but the other
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:55.280]   reason I know door dash well is because of my mom back in Cranston road island it's see uh mom's
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.400]   86 she told me a while ago I just don't have the energy to cook anymore she was a great cook man
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.960]   I grew up with the best food in the world and I just kind of broke my heart and I'm so far away I
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:11.360]   wish I could cook for her but I can't so I said mom I put door dash on her phone I put my credit card
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:17.280]   in the door dash and I said anytime you want order door dash get whatever you want from the best
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:23.520]   restaurants in Providence and you know it's a great feeling every time I get the charge comes
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:28.080]   through on my card and I see it I see all mom got something good in fact she loves it because it
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.880]   gets a grandkids over social order pizza I know I know when will engraider you're visiting because
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.120]   she'll get pizza I went you know and then when she she'll go get Italian when she's not this is uh
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:42.400]   this is good this came very fast it's still hot this is from our local Italian suco but

[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.760]   want to see you i thought about it i would have ordered door dash early too i would have just went

[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:32.000]   you door dash is awesome and we thank him door dash would deliver to the library i'm guessing right
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.760]   anywhere yeah uh i'm not see the thing is i like this conference room i'm not sure if i if i filled
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.960]   it with delicious burrito smell they may not like it again it might be that might be a problem but
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:48.320]   there is a yeah i will i will demand you share i will definitely look into door dash in my own
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.200]   community because yeah i would but there there is there is a picnic table outside the library i'm
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:59.600]   sure they would deliver to the picker you ordered a seared scallop risotto a chopped spinach and fig
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:05.920]   a chicken artichoke pakata oven roasted beets and a grilled filet menu and all for me that was so nice
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:12.640]   of you uh so sweet no i don't get all i have a feeling as big as mine the staff the staff is eating well
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:19.920]   thanks to door dash uh all right thank you door dash for support and mac break weekly and for feedin
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:26.240]   leo yeah that is that that's that's there isn't very often this tim cook email ripping into the
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.960]   journal report that doesn't happen very often that's a big deal that he responded to that and it
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.520]   makes me think that must have been it must have really got it wrong yeah that's right but i want
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:41.360]   to eat that right can can you just pass that over to me so put it in front of poor lorry
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.400]   take a look at smell it really mean
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.800]   operate operate in lorry here give it to me and i'll put it down here yeah
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.200]   asio vial pakata oh good i get the salad all right
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:59.040]   anyway to the tenset anything it would have just been a story that we went on to the next
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.280]   story the next day would have all forgotten about it this significantly raises the stakes and they
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:09.120]   don't do that lightly no but you know what i think it was be out of respect for the man it wasn't it
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:15.600]   wasn't that apple was but hurt by bad pr at all it was that out of respect for johnny and the team
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:22.560]   tim i think this is tim saying yeah i can't let this stand this is not this is disrespectful
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:29.920]   and and it's not true and i believe him when he says that so fine uh apple has decided we were
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.200]   wondering when they announced the new mac pro which man i wish i could get dor das to bring me that
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:43.680]   wait what's your tip on a 35 000 workstation so much money for a couple of bucks yeah
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:51.840]   they have announced that they maybe not announced the wall street journal has learned
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:58.880]   that they are not going to make it in the uh in the austin texas uh factory where they were making
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:04.560]   the old mac the oatmeal box as you call it anti mac pro they're going to make it in china it's going
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.360]   to be made by quanta computer which is a time when he's company they are ramping up production at a
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:16.400]   factory near shang high according to people with knowledge of the story uh and it does make sense
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:21.280]   it's a lot easier to manufacture something in china because they have the facilities
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:28.000]   uh thanks in great part to apple and the iphone uh they also have the suppliers and the suppliers are
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.240]   right there which makes it much easier to do just in time production of a computer you're not going
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.560]   to sell very many a huge amount of metal workers which we really lost and i can remember my grandfather
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.960]   moved here from germany and he was in his 60s and he got a job like that in a metal plant because
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.360]   they're they were desperate to hire people just nobody here was training in the kind of metal work
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:49.600]   that they needed and it's apparently the same for apple like you've got a champ for edges you've
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:56.560]   got to do all those drill and they have an incredibly deep trade school program there that we just
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:03.200]   we've allowed to atrophy there was a great uh a kind of series of comments on reddit i'm gonna
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:10.560]   see if i can find it about the how they made speculation complete speculation on how they made
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:17.520]   those holes in the mac pro case in the video isn't it in the video do they show how they're doing it
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.280]   i think in one of the videos they show like the different punching that's going on there
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.200]   see what we can find they were talking in this uh in this thread about you know and it was a
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:31.360]   bunch of machinists exactly as you say a bunch of highly skilled machinists saying no you gotta use
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.640]   i think you gotta use a cylinder drill i mean it was really interesting that uh and now i with all
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:43.120]   probably with all likelihood date apples building a custom machine that can crank those out i would
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.280]   guess they almost always build the machines that make the machines and then they lease they
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.680]   lease those to the or the companies lease it from it it's a very complicated yeah because then we
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:58.000]   but not that this is going to be a high volume product by any means um anyway the somebody was
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.040]   asking on twitter on sunday well what happened to the flex plant in austin uh according to the journal
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:14.240]   as the demand for the mac pro taper tapered off in 2014 flex began laying people off several
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.800]   former flex employees said by last year they were down to a skeleton crew working just a quarter
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   one quarter of one of the assembly lines and refurbishing mac pros um so it's you know and then
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:36.400]   that flex plant is also doing doing other things for other people so it's uh the mac pro doesn't
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:43.840]   sell in enough quantity to keep a entire assembly line busy either in austin or in china so while
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:49.600]   it's a loss of jobs it's not a doubt it's a significant loss of jobs i think nealy from the
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.080]   verge is is camped outside those fox compliance and wisconsin trying to see if anybody's ever
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.200]   gonna move in to them where they're gonna take them over anyway.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.960]   They broke ground almost two years ago right i mean it's been a while and they announced
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   other ones and i think he said like there's many malls in those places still because it's
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:10.720]   also bizarre yeah i mean that's pretty apparent that that's fox conchering favor with the with
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:15.520]   the white house and and saying yeah we'll spend 50 billion here just give us some tax breaks and
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.520]   they'll make us have to do anything but we'll just keep it right yeah yeah we'll do that it's
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:24.080]   remember uh president trump said apple was going to be build three big beautiful plants in the
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.640]   united states and there's deafening silence from apple after that statement.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:34.800]   yeah well they're human plants they filled with humans somebody said yeah it's a really nice
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:42.320]   ficus uh yeah see that's that that's the other upshot of uh of promising that you're going to
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:48.080]   create jobs and economically depress part of the country because the real real estate is super
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:53.280]   super cheap back there even if you're not getting any tax breaks and so what if that's like table
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:58.160]   stakes uh for company like fox conch so why wouldn't they make agreements to do to build
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.720]   plants that hey what do you know maybe maybe a meteor will strike uh the the earth will shift
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.280]   enough on its backs is that will become economically feasible to manufacture phones inside the
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:13.360]   united states of america uh but if they don't again that's just table stakes you can get rid of that
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:20.640]   property very very easily uh and though the upside is just so gigantic it's it's unfortunate that
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:27.360]   fox con decided to play this game as as ably as they did a couple of uh recalls apple we mentioned
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:34.800]   i think last week that 2015 macbook pro is uh has a battery problem you will be contacted by apple
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.480]   or of course you go to the apple site there's a serial number checker and now we're learning
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:45.680]   that some macbook heirs are having trouble with the the motherboard uh it affects 2018 macbook
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:51.440]   heirs with the retina display and touch id i have one of those but i think according to your article
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:58.960]   and uh i more that you should just go to the apple site and enter the uh serial number or
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:08.240]   how would you know yeah apple yeah you go ahead ranny see when i said your article actually i was
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.280]   talking to danny zapata but uh since he's not with us
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.080]   i did the previous one i think and then he did the next one
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:23.680]   you would you would go to the apple site and enter your um uh your your id number for your
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:29.360]   computer to find out if it's within the time frame of the of the recall okay so you're the replacement
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:35.600]   so basically you go to support dot apple dot com slash exchange underscore repair that's the link
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:41.280]   danny put in in the article they haven't yet added it to the list of exchange and repair
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:48.160]   extension programs uh here the 15 inch mac pro is macbook pro though is and so you click that link
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.560]   some people were wondering like why some of these things which seem like niche issues get so much
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:56.720]   attention like but you have to consider what it is like if apple has a battery supplier that says
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:02.240]   we've discovered a problem with a run of batteries those can fail critically and you can't mess
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:06.400]   around those like we know exactly which parts here which machines they're in you please stop
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.080]   using those bring them back to us we will fix it there is there's no wiggle room and that kind of
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   stuff other stuff there's a whole bunch of different criteria that's to me but batter nobody messes
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:19.760]   around with that yeah and that's why they're repairing a 2015 macbook pro well out of warranty
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:24.720]   yeah because it's just dangerous now these macbook years are uh probably still under warranty i don't
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:31.200]   know uh they say a very very small number of models are being affected yeah but they said that about
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:36.480]   the keyboard yeah it is i mean that's the game because they're not 100 million cost numbers it's a small
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.400]   number one percent of a hundred million is you know it's a small percentage but it's not a small
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:46.720]   number so this would be an argument for registering uh your macbook uh error or your any apple product
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:52.320]   because they're going to email people with affected macbook errors so make sure they have a current
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.920]   email for you i think if it's the current one and that's october and you would have you would have
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:01.600]   regular apple care up until october anyway okay good apples documents list symptoms as issues with
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:10.880]   power but don't say what problems users are having so thank you danny thank you i'm more as always
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:19.840]   uh for writing that so i don't know enough about oauth two and the issues involved uh to understand
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:26.800]   what the issue with apples single sign-on is but an open letter to kreg federie from the open i.d
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:33.840]   foundation they're very happy that apple is kind of under you know scoring the importance of their
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:40.480]   work the open i.d foundation applauds apples efforts to allow users to log into third party module and
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:46.000]   web applications with their apple apple i.d using open i.d connect but there apparently are some
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.640]   differences appears apple has largely adopted open i.d connect for their sign-in with apple
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:55.920]   implementation offering at least intended to but there are differences and they're tracking the
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:03.280]   differences the open i.d foundation is asking apple to address the gaps between what open i.d
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:09.120]   connect does and what sign-in with apple does and to it there is in fact a test suite to to certify
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:16.960]   interoperability and then join the open i.d foundation yeah which i think is probably a good idea this
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.680]   this kind of stuff this single sign-on stuff works best when it's cross-platform and compatible
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:29.920]   with other people's implementations well apple if i'm not mistaken said that that will be
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:38.560]   signing in with that with apple i.d will be um well at least cross-platform amongst apple related
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:43.520]   things like it'll work with safari it'll work with your mac and your iphone and ipad so
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:50.720]   it's a great so it'll work in chrome it'll so yes okay so it'll work with chrome so it seems like
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:59.200]   they're they're doing that so the the letter from open i.d from the open i.d foundation at first to me
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:06.640]   read um a polite way of saying you copy catatus no no no no no it's a standard they want no no they
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:13.120]   want it to so here's the spec violations there's you know i i can't judge how important these
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:22.000]   particular spec violations are but some of them could have security impacts right so that's the key
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:29.040]   for instance they say the code i.d token response type returns the response parameters including i.d
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:33.280]   token and code is query parameters and not in the fragment that means it could leak
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.640]   through the referrer it could leak personal data information it's a privacy problem
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:46.960]   so of course apple doesn't want it to be a privacy problem and uh remember that this well is it out
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:52.480]   already are people using it no it's i don't even think it's you can't upload apps with it until apple
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:58.000]   starts accepting ios 13 submissions so you can probably do some sdk testing with it but i don't
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.760]   think it can be in the wild yet so a number of these uh spec violations have to do with privacy and
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:09.840]   security so that's the key the code i.d token response type doesn't include a hash so attackers
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.800]   could insert the authorization code they've obtained things like that so these these are important
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:21.200]   uh there are also some peculiarities i think these could be fixed easily and i bet apple wants
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.240]   to fix them and i think this is i only bring it up just to put more pressure on apple to do it do
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:33.760]   it right yeah also these yeah especially not that happens to me for five seconds but
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:43.040]   uh do you're sort of platforming that's that's that apple id sign-in is somehow more secure than
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.640]   you know using google or facebook then you better you know do something to make sure that it actually
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:54.800]   is as secure as you claim it is and uh you know just not sharing your data with a bunch of other
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.880]   marketing companies doesn't mean you're more secure if you're leaving these big holes in the in the
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:07.840]   operating of the feature that could allow um access from from other parties i can all wait to
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:12.960]   your apples response because i i'm not qualified to judge the security or insecurity of their
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.560]   implementation but you're that's that nails it lory which is uh it should be at least as secure
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:25.600]   as the others yeah or or you haven't really accomplished anything um yeah and the other
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.520]   problem is that when you have deviations from when when you have us when you have everybody piling
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:35.040]   on to the exact same standard it means that whatever edge cases there are in implementing
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:40.800]   this look and you're just one team trying to get your one product to uh to have have authorization on
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:47.200]   it uh you will find a situation where oh but we we have salespeople on our on our sales force
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.480]   who need to be able to connect around this proxy so we're going to create a situation so that we
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.440]   can still validate them even though technically we are skipping over something that is part of a
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.320]   of a standard every every single every single implementation has these edge cases in it and
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.440]   when you have a real real standard it turns out that everybody is if there's been enough people who
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.720]   have had that same problem there's going to be at least a standard way around it uh that everybody
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:18.320]   can sort of anticipate and plan for when you have uh when you have an alternative to something like
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.360]   OAuth and now you have people trying to implement an alternative to this they don't really have
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.040]   the same library of excuses in the library of edge cases to rely on and so you wind up with a
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.520]   at best a certain amount of chaos in terms of how things have to be implemented and how things have
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.880]   to be accepted on the other end and at worst you wind up with a lot of new security holes as we've
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.320]   been talking about that could have been easily easily handled if they just simply piled onto
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:50.880]   an existing uh and useful and and and battle honed uh standard yeah we've seen this and this is kind
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:57.920]   of a regular refrain on security now which is coming up later today is that uh uh
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:05.760]   crypto and security in general designed in a silo is never yeah is never going to be as good as
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.200]   stuff that's vetted and shown to other people and you let experts look at it um it's always a
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.560]   mistake to try to do it yourself and and famously there's a there's a reason why it's trivially
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.800]   easy to uh crack the crack the uh DRM on a DVD and converted to a video file and that's because the
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.080]   video the the motion picture association decided to not show their encryption standard to anybody
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.920]   because that would have that would have met that would have made it weaker because people would
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.400]   have figured out how to crack it and of course all these cracks be a high school students in a month
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.480]   yeah and then you also have to evangelize it or you get open SSL you got to make it open and then
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.440]   you got to force people to look at it yeah yeah no that's a good point to open SSL had a horrible
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.200]   flaw in it for years and years and years because nobody was looking so you got to make them look
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:55.600]   got to make them look major luck uh well and and Andy it's not just uh as far back as DVD
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:02.320]   WEP encryption right then WPA encryption then WPA to encryption all were created in a vacuum
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.480]   and as soon as experts were able to look at they never were able to look at the code but they were
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.360]   able to find the flaws and uh the same thing is happening by the way with the Wi-Fi coalition
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:17.920]   they've got a new WPA 3 spec which you know must be able to vet which always it's problematic so
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:24.000]   I have to ask you uh about this I don't know it's Danny's article again but maybe Rene or Lori
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.680]   can compliment on it we knew that back to my Mac was being removed in the in Catalina but
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:36.640]   apparently they're turning it off for all versions retroactively yeah well this was announced that
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.320]   oh it was I misheard it I thought it would just be for the new version yeah they said they were
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:48.800]   sun setting the program as as of the end of July or end of June and so today's July 2nd so I
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.520]   don't think they actually shut it off yesterday but today it's it it is so so in other words back
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.840]   to my Mac to do Nat traversal how to go through Apple's servers was that the point and they're
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:03.200]   not going to have those servers on anymore Apple would you talk to the IP address for you yeah
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:09.680]   which I found really handy I love that feature um or IP DED it's it's kind of necessary because
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.320]   if you don't have a Nat that traversal is always the problem so I mean you can do it there's other
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   services it's just super geeky and this was so easy this was Apple at its best it was making what
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.840]   was a geeky service I loved it. It was probably available in accessible to the mainstream. I use it
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:27.040]   all the time so do you have to now go to a third party lorry for remote access or what?
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:33.360]   Um so you know I've never actually used back to my Mac before so I don't know the details about what
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.960]   makes what makes it perfect and what makes it usable and so Renee might be a little bit better but
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:45.360]   there are built-in apps in your in your Mac that let you access some of the stuff I know okay um
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:51.520]   so it's it's just a matter of sort of transitioning the way you do it but Renee you might be able to
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.760]   speak a little bit better about some of the features that it has that maybe aren't built into Mac.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.840]   Like I mean the sharing stuff there's a lot of the sharing stuff that's still there but it's like
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.600]   you can share your files what was nice about back to my Mac was literally your Mac popping up in
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:08.560]   front of you. Yeah you could use your Mac yeah yeah yeah yeah I use screen now because screens is
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.680]   magnificent Luke uh Vondol makes screens and it's a beautiful app but you know it's it's a proper
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.440]   VNC app and it costs 30 bucks and it's worth I think it's 30 bucks might be cheaper now it was
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:22.560]   when I bought it worth every penny um but it was nice to have at least it was like the same thing
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.800]   Apple does the baseline version and then if you need more features you get like the big boy version
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.760]   the big girl version uh and I I did and it's a wonderful wonderful app but I'm more in that Apple
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:35.600]   is no longer doing the baseline feature. See I don't use any of usage numbers like the thing
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.160]   that kills me like I know they can't just make features for me and I remember once the people
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:45.680]   were complaining that there the Bluetooth keyboard support in a new version of tvOS wasn't fixed yet
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:51.360]   and Apple's like literally everybody uses that feature is here at WWDC right now we have a week
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.440]   to get it working before anybody goes home and actually uses it because no real people use that
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:01.600]   feature and I'm sure they have usage stats for all this that says you know like 0.001% used it
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.440]   but I would still like them to keep all the personal services that I use a live result as possible.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:13.920]   Just you right? I do think that's a little like saying so few people are willing a couple
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.200]   hundred years ago so few people travel west from the east coast it's really no point in building
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.680]   railroads or the thing is that the people who are doing these who are using these features are
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:29.200]   oftentimes leading the way for the mainstream users of a couple of years from now and if you're
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.120]   not willing to accommodate people who are really trying to get the most out of your platform
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.240]   you will never make the most out of the platform that you're trying to develop.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:49.120]   It was a bad month last month for Mac Malware. Six threats came to light. The most recent
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:54.880]   published Friday by Antigua which again I mean there's only this issue of
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.760]   Antigua's an antivirus company selling an antivirus for the Mac and yet that's who's doing
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:04.720]   security research in many cases and that's who discovers these things because often they find it
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:10.880]   because their customers find it and send it on to them. They call it OS 10 Crescent Core
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:18.400]   according to Antigua the team has observed it in the wild being distributed via numerous sites
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.960]   Mac users should be aware they may encounter it even via seemingly innocuous sources like Google
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:29.280]   search results. They're signed with certificates belonging to an Apple trusted developer
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:35.200]   which is always worrisome because that bypasses PES as a gatekeeper.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:45.520]   Earlier this month there was OS 10 Linker that was a zero-day vulnerability in gatekeeper.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:53.120]   A cryptocurrency miner called Loud Miner was discovered by ESET and Bird Miner by Malware
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   by
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.760]   the same miner just different names. They were discovered that independently it was found in a cracked
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:08.160]   installer for the high-end music production software Ableton Live. OS 10 New tab injects
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:16.800]   tabs into the Safari browser and back doors called Netwire and Moax installed through in the wild
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:23.680]   attacks using that zero-day in Firefox it was pretty nasty. In both cases these were installing
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:30.480]   this is the hot thing now cryptocurrency miners on your machine. The current one the new one
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:36.560]   often poses as an updater installer for Adobe's flash media player.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:44.560]   Please don't run that. Please you don't need it. Is it weird that I'm like proud of Mac for
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.880]   being important enough to... It's good news. People want us.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.920]   It's an economic crime right? So we've been an economic crime.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:57.520]   Yeah nobody ever cared about Mac before. There wasn't enough people using it and now
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:03.600]   more and more there's viruses and malware that comes out and it's sort of dedicated to Mac and
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.960]   I always think we need to go. We need to run the things off.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.520]   Is it not the scrappy little newcomer you used to be?
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.280]   Yeah. Our target matured. What's that Zafud beable Brock's line from the
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.560]   Hissher's Guide to the Galaxy when the ship is being attacked as they're trying to get to a
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.920]   treasure planet? Wow we must be really onto something if they're trying to kill us.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:29.440]   I mentioned these not to scare people well maybe to raise awareness but also to remind people
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.240]   that that is outdated that notion that I'm on a Mac I'm safe I don't have a worry.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:39.040]   I'm not saying you should install an antivirus I don't know if that's the solution. Actually I'm
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.240]   curious what I don't normally say installing any virus Renee do you put an antivirus on your Mac?
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:50.400]   No because often I find the behavior of the antivirus to be sort of virus like in itself.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.440]   But if you're not going to do it like there's some cases where you might need to for example if
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.520]   you are part of a corporation that mandates it as part of their security policies you might
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:04.480]   have no choice in it. I don't but I also like I'm not a kid anymore Leo I'm not going around
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:09.520]   really nearly like links gone wild tapping on everything on the internet. So tap on anything.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:17.120]   I download most of my stuff. I really know. Yeah. Yeah no I mean I download from the Mac App Store
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.840]   because it's so convenient and I realized there can be attacks on the Mac App Store as well but I
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.200]   try to keep my target as small as possible and so far I've been lucky but there might come a day
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.800]   when you know that that changes and I hope Windows Microsoft Windows Defender was phenomenal
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.600]   because it was built so close to the actual operating system and Apple's doing a ton of stuff if you
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.280]   watch the WWDC session on advances in Mac security like they're isolating the kernel they're
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.800]   creating driver kits or drivers aren't in the kernel anymore they're also getting rid of
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.600]   KEX and DEX and that's all operating in user land now and not in the kernel level and they have
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:57.440]   malware gatekeeper which used to run malware only on quarantined files which means first run files
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:02.640]   launched by the GUI is now doing it on GUI and terminal and bundles launched by the terminal
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.960]   and they're also doing it every time an app launches not just the first time you launch it
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.280]   because apps are being modified while they're live on your machine now so they're doing a ton of
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.960]   stuff and I'm hoping that they're at least keeping up if not to if not being greatly outpaced yet
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.400]   and that's the direction I'd like to see it go because I feel like that stuff always performs
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:26.240]   better in the long run than third parties Andy do you use the antivirus or any Andy malware?
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.520]   No and for the reasons that Renee says I just don't have I've never seen an antivirus that doesn't
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:37.600]   create more problems than it solves on the platform of Macintosh where so so it's really the
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:44.560]   on a Macintosh the best the best defense is just simply good hygiene don't don't pay for
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.320]   pay for Photoshop if you can't afford to pay for Photoshop buy an app that you can't afford
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:57.280]   that is Photoshop like or download a open source app from trusted repository because if you think
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:03.280]   that you're saying oh wow look some guy has a has a cracked version of Photoshop yeah it's been cracked
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:09.280]   to do lots of bad things to your machine so just just don't do stuff like that and all and the
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.880]   the amount of it's I'm glad that Apple is taking security so seriously and not just simply saying
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.360]   hey no one no one writes stuff to attack max we don't have to worry about this if they might
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:26.240]   they might be going a little bit far I was I'm trying to like write a write an app that uses
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:31.520]   JSON content from someplace and so downloaded some like example source and I just tried it's a
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:36.880]   text file and I try to open it and BB edit but because the dot extension that looked like it was
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.240]   like scriptable code it said I'm sorry this text file does not come from a from a known
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:47.760]   certified developer so I'm not going to let you open this and BB edit and I was like to a
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:54.160]   really a file BB edit you've never heard of BB edit really
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:00.640]   and but I could still open it after going into security but it's like yeah I never I've never
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.520]   encountered this before okay I suppose it's for like like most things that make me curse the name
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:10.560]   of Apple computer I suppose this is for my own good it's for your own good Andy how about you
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:17.600]   Lordy you use any I use I use malware bytes and it works great I haven't ever had an issue which
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.080]   is good because that means I'm I'm taking care of my back in a good way but I use it I think
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.160]   it's great to have in the background if you ever do come across an issue like the nature of my
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:31.600]   what I do for a living you know I get developers that approach me all the time and if they have a
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.760]   Mac app that's not in the app store I don't necessarily dismiss them immediately even if it's
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:40.800]   someone I've never heard of I will sometimes give them a try after you know doing a little
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:45.600]   research on the company and making sure that they seem like they're a legitimate developer
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:51.200]   but that also you know that's my Mac is at risk whenever I download anything that's not directly
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:55.600]   from the app store the Mac app store so having no robots in the background just kind of you
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:01.440]   know makes me feel a little safer we had I had a call a couple weeks ago from a woman Bonnie she's
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.920]   in her 80s had a Mac and she she said Safari keeps crashing and I'm starting to worry that I've
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:13.360]   got something on here and I we kind of spent some time looking and found two at least two different
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:20.080]   I wouldn't call them viruses they were browser hijackers they were adware basically yeah on
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:27.440]   her system and she was by the way not an unsophisticated user I found out she used to work for NASA
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:34.560]   writing code to detect high energy or to determine how much damage could be caused by high energy
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:43.920]   particles hitting the space station a program she wrote in Fortran so she was no novice but I
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:50.080]   ended up recommending malware bites because it was specifically called out that it would remove
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.440]   that particular adware I'm not normally a fan of that kind of stuff and like you Renee and
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:16:00.240]   Nandy I don't like to keep antivirus stuff running in the background but you could download malware
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:05.600]   bites and use it to scan and then remove it I guess yeah that yeah it's it actually they even
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:11.680]   have like a free version that that's you just just scanned so you know if you're you're feeling that
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.480]   there's something you know a little bit wrong with your Mac it's to me malware bites is the best
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:23.440]   option for you know somebody who doesn't want to necessarily go all in on a antivirus software I
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.880]   just don't want to run it in the background all the time I think that's what they and they don't
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:32.000]   like either they're gonna have to use the new process like the part of what's new in the system
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.360]   extension architecture is specific things for antivirus which means they'll no longer be allowed
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.880]   to run at the kernel level either they're gonna have to run in user land and I'm hoping that that
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.360]   also means that they run more efficiently yeah that's an issue with the Microsoft because antiviruses
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:50.320]   like to hook into the kernel and of course that means they really are a security risk because if
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.440]   if they have a flaw and we've seen it happen a couple at least several times then that just it's a
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:00.160]   straight shot for the bad guy right in the right in the kernel there's no rules because you get
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:04.880]   to write the rules yeah yeah so yeah maybe just run something like malware bites to scan don't run
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:11.680]   it in the background um I don't yeah or and there are online streams I run it in the background
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.720]   and it's fine I think maybe some of it has to do with you know how how much you use like what you
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:21.280]   do on your computer right so you know I think if you're not running heavy processes running
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:27.040]   something like malware bites in the background isn't as intensive as it might be for someone like
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:33.840]   you who might be editing video software or something like that right right uh she also we discovered
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:40.080]   she had grandchildren teenage grandchildren uh uh and she went over this girl's drop back she
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.360]   she said maybe I shouldn't let them use my account on the Mac I said no create a guest account
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.440]   let them use the guest account it's wiped every night it's wiped every night and and that way
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:56.720]   even if they do something chances are you'll be safe um yeah that's an it's actually a question
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.240]   I haven't asked it's in some time what do you recommend uh guess what grandkids I bought you
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.440]   your own laptop use it's called it's called a Chromebook it's a Chromebook you're gonna love it
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:17.920]   this is this weekend was the 12th anniversary of the shipping of the first iPhone January 20
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.160]   June 29th 2007 is announced in January but it came out in June uh and I thought it'd be kind of fun
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:30.720]   that that by the way of Johnny I've designed Johnny I've joined um do you remember Renee how did you
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:37.120]   now you're in Canada so you didn't have the I had to wait until it was jailbroken to the extent that
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:44.000]   you could unlock it and then I smuggled one into Canada and had to run it on Rogers and because we
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.120]   didn't have the great Canadian riots of iPhone 3G yet it was if I remember correctly two hundred
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:55.840]   dollars for a hundred megabytes of data wow yeah I brought Amber MacArthur at jailbroken iPhone yes
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.520]   because because I wanted her to have it and she said no I'm not gonna use that but it would allow
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.720]   her to use it on Rogers how about you Lori do you did you get an iPhone the on day one I I was
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:13.920]   a late comer to the smartphone oh wow I I think it was the 3GS was my first I thought the whole thing
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:20.480]   was a joke I really didn't have any clue I thought why would anybody want to carry around
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:26.880]   something like that I was also late to the iPod game too so it took me a while back then to
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:34.320]   get over my sort of technological chromaginess I wanted to be you know vinyl records are the best
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:40.880]   and oh you're writing letters to each other you know so I resisted at first until I realized how
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:46.640]   incredible they were and then then I was on board credit to Walt Mossberg he uh he tweeted his
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.120]   review his original review and he spotted it right away the key
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:58.080]   element of this little computer that didn't have cut and paste it only had 2G it had a 3 and a half
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:04.480]   inch screen but no apps no app store no apps but he saw it immediately the headline is the
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:10.320]   iPhone is a breakthrough handheld computer and that was what was key about the iPhone it was it was
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:14.400]   it wasn't about being a phone and of course we've all learned now and this was the beginning of the
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:21.360]   of the smartphone era and I think people will look back honestly and and say that they'll say 2007
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:26.480]   watershed moment in technology the beginning of the smartphone era look how much it's changed
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:32.880]   our lives if you had told me in 2006 that we would all be running around with some flavor of
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:37.680]   Unix or Linux in our pocket running some version of the KHTML browser and it wouldn't be windows
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.240]   and explorer just everywhere in this universe I would have thought you were nuts yeah now looking
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.640]   at it I can't believe the world we live in where most people are are now using some flavor of
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:52.400]   Unix and some flavor of KHTML as their daily computer Andy when did you get your first iPhone
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:59.280]   I'm trying to remember I don't you don't ever forget when you get your first iPhone I'm saying
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:07.840]   I remember like being being assured and not in an in the apples way of letting you know that you'll
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:15.200]   definitely be getting one for review but not confirming it and my wanting one anyway so I bought one I
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:22.400]   definitely pre-ordered one as a matter of fact I had a huge blow up with AT&T was my carrier back
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:29.520]   then and I had a huge customer service blow up with them like in 2006 because they don't they
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:35.280]   did they did something so they I was off contract and I bought a new windows phone that I really really
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   loved and I wouldn't get data and because it was because my my ancient sim didn't have enough memory
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:46.240]   on it for the new network so okay by the way we'll send you out a new sim we'll cost 15 bucks
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:51.120]   that's fine oh and and we'll be on a new one-year contract say well I don't want to be on a contract
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:55.600]   or send me the sim well we can't send you a sim unless we put you on a one-year contract and I
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:01.280]   fought and fought and fought like it was so I going to getting finally to the point where I said to
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.960]   whatever level of customer service I finally made it to and say that I have been a customer of AT&T
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:13.920]   since the first time it was AT&T through the time it was singular and I am so and I know that you
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:18.480]   are not doing this because there's a technical reason you're doing this because you feel as though
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:23.360]   it's good it would be so annoying for me to switch to or the carrier that I'm not willing to do that
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:28.640]   just because and so you can you can hook me on a one-year contract and I you're willing to lose a
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:36.320]   customer based on this sir madam and they say yes yes we definitely are and I was so close to
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:42.320]   saying all right well scurvy I'm going to Verizon or whatever and then but then like I calmed down
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:49.680]   and realized that remember that apple did not apple introduced it in January of 2007 but everybody
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:56.000]   knew it was coming and at that point I think which was August or maybe even June the information that
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.960]   I had made me really really believe that AT&T was going to have an exclusive on it so I really had
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.600]   to talk myself down and saying are you really willing to because you know you're going to want
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.400]   to buy one of these iPhones you know you're going to have to go back onto AT&T like just for this
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:16.800]   iPhone anyway are you sure you really want for empty hollow and meaningless gesture that will
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:24.880]   give you 10 seconds of of satisfaction and and I had to answer myself no I guess not so that's why
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:33.680]   I'm a programmer but yeah I did buy did get the first day I will say that I did get to actually
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:39.360]   I got 45 minutes of play time in a briefing room like right after the announcement on January
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:45.040]   with whatever was functioning at the time and I'm telling you this was for those like three or four
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:50.640]   months it was like let's invite Andy to our dinner party because he's he's one of the 12 men who've
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.960]   walked on the moon he'll tell us stories about walking on the moon that no one else has and I'm
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:01.360]   saying oh yes the screen really was as fluid as as can be and when I loaded that New York Times page
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:06.880]   it was it was fluid and lifelike and tapping was like yeah it was like tell us again above
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:14.080]   how about tell us again about how the how the icons bounce and move and jiggle like oh child
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:19.280]   such jiggling such dragging and dropping as such you've never seen so yeah there was so much
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:25.200]   excitement for if there's there was so much excitement for that first iPhone on the first day of release
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:30.320]   it oh it's I don't think there is anything that's similar to it within technology every
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:38.480]   every single day of launch line and and hysteria after that was just a pale copy it was like the
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.520]   another version of Woodstock if you weren't there for the first one you don't understand that there
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:50.240]   was the only one just like it it was great here's Steve Wozniak in line to get the first you don't
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:56.240]   have my audience Steve it's a great day isn't it hey it's Friday the 29th of June I can hardly tell
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:04.560]   you I've had so little sleep like all those people there right I have a shower or change my clothes
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:11.520]   or even change my underwear seriously I'm sure getting ready for this serious people are waiting in line
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:17.120]   here where is Steve for three days he might come he might come right here to the store to this
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:24.800]   store yes you let me know you'll see okay they're gonna be here all day okay we also we also talked
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:31.600]   to was I can't remember who it was who was it John that we sent out to talk to Woz and I was
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:38.000]   myself waiting in line but I was smart enough not to go down to San Francisco or to the Palo Alto
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.200]   store where Steve was but just our local AT&T store over here and the line wasn't super long but it
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.880]   was a but that those were the days those lines were fun two people sitting in front of me were
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.480]   Googlers who had come up from Mountain View because they thought it'd be easier to get it at the
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:26:01.200]   AT&T store in Petaloma for some reason and they were right they were ahead of me they got them and
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.280]   they had said they told me yeah we were up we were pulling all nighters last few nights getting
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.000]   Google Reader ready to work on this three and a half inch screen which is pretty cool this is the
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:18.800]   iPhone I got oh it was $4.99 for four gigs of storage but I opted for the massive eight gig
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:24.400]   version for $5.99 yeah it still works if I had a 30 pin connector I could charge it up I've done
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:30.160]   it before and I remember like all my old contacts are on there my apps there weren't apps there were
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:35.840]   websites right you didn't get apps and my music collection which seemed to heavily favor Britney
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:41.760]   Spears at the time but it's fun to still have this I mean this is this is historic and I'm
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:49.440]   I've owned every iPhone since then at great expense I don't even want to add it all up but
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:55.360]   honestly this sure I mean I had a blackberry pearl before this I was using blackberry since
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.080]   the early 2000s so I was texting and oh here comes a 30 pin connector maybe we could
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.960]   maybe we can plug this in why do you have a third yeah you got a weird dongle man
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:12.560]   you got a weird answer Leo you can't the younger younger people have never used an i a first iPhone
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.200]   if you have if you have a friend who has one in a drawer I can't recommend highly enough you charge
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:26.960]   it up and say wow the screen is so rough and with so little oh my god scrolling is so slow
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:32.560]   and transitions from one app to another my god it's like the frame rate is terrible and but it was
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:38.160]   so it was it was a miracle at the time at 2007 yeah it was you can't appreciate you
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.960]   pointing them side by side and realizing that this was just only it was only like five or six years
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:47.040]   later that we have the sort of performance that you come to expect from an iPhone it really
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:53.680]   does seem miraculous now we're getting images of a phone a living nice guy it's got this
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:58.800]   well it's got this cumberbund at the bottom Leo this yeah cumberbund for the radio yeah yeah
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.680]   yeah and yeah compare it I mean look at the two together uh this is the I live that little phone
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:08.960]   we've come a long way baby like I used to say this could kill this and call inside it like a
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:17.680]   tonton for warmth and it's and it's a harbinger of things to come stupid apple design decisions
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.480]   that seem to make no sense and inconvenience everybody hey let's give it a standard headphone
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.680]   jack but let's make the hole for the headphone jack so tiny that you can't use any headphones
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:33.760]   with it unless you add a dongle oh yeah that's right it's so deep yeah it's because otherwise
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:38.960]   we'd have to like take a little tiny little bite out of the casing to make it fit and we'd much
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:45.360]   rather inconvenience everybody using this phone than have a tiny little crescent bite out in this
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.720]   section well I think we borrowed from Patrick Delahanty his 30 pin dock so I've got I've got
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:56.320]   it plugged in and if it charges up in time we can we could see what Leo was listening to in 2007
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:04.720]   the new uh iPhone 11 xi we don't know what it's going to be called uh will we pretty sure have this
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:12.320]   bumpy camera on the back of it these are uh CAD designs from slash leaks probably intended for
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:18.640]   case manufacturers but I don't know um expected to have probably made by the case management yeah
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:25.360]   maybe they're guests right five point eight six point five inch uh 10s and 10s max successors triple
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:32.880]   lens cameras um though then there'll be a third LCD maybe we don't know that we'll have dual lens
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:40.000]   does look a lot like the renders we've seen of the pixel four so maybe this is the the new the new
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.800]   thing I don't I don't normally squares other than you notch squares in the new notch I don't
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:52.880]   normally do that but always says you're welcome yeah yeah um maybe I'll change the line when I see it
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:57.840]   if it's gold like if the whole thing is gold with like three little black dots it's going to just
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:03.520]   look like an emoji surprise face to me but if the whole back is black I mean that that is going to
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:08.720]   look way better like I've had I've had lumiophones that had huge black like they're like like alien
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.960]   face huggers on the back of those phones but they were amazing cameras so I'm not going to judge it
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:18.960]   until I until I use yeah yeah as a public service we need to spread the word on social media that
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:26.240]   we you have until let's say July we'll say August 2nd uh to continue to make fun of uh android
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:31.120]   phones that have that square bump out and call it stupid and unrealistic and impractical because
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:35.840]   after that you're going to have to start preparing your argument for how apple it's okay for them to
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:40.560]   do it because they did it right they did it thoughtfully they did it intelligently I have to point out
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:46.240]   by the way uh you know one of the issues of course is face ID fingerprint reader so forth this one
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:55.520]   plus seven pro has a um it's um not optical like the samsung s10 it's a it's a um what is it what
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:01.920]   is it what are they using it's uh what's the opposite of optical sonic sonic and watch how fast it is
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:07.520]   there's the there's the little image that pops up for the fingerprint reader it's as fast as a
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:13.760]   physical fingerprint reader it's it's really really good and much faster than the s10 so I think it
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:19.760]   is possible to have a beneath the screen fingerprint reader or get there yeah this this thing is as
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:24.400]   fast as it's understandable why apple didn't ship it two years ago with the iphone 10 but we're
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.840]   getting to the point where it's probably fast enough like why don't why don't you have one now I
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:31.920]   mean this is this uh you could see it's as fast everybody's as fast as anything we've ever
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:38.080]   used before it's gonna but we have to make sure we we have we're in to see if it's going to be
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:43.280]   as reliable as the old dedicated sensor was well I wonder if it's as human and reliable but I don't
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:48.640]   know if it's as sure it's been very reliable can it can it be faked with with scotch tissue
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:55.360]   which is the usual usual test yeah anyway just thought I thought I'd throw that out there um
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:02.240]   apple news plus according to mac rumors is not a huge success couple of publishers they
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:09.120]   talked to anonymously said apple had promised us 10 times the revenue from texture right now it's
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:14.320]   one 20th of that in other words half as much as we were making from texture which wasn't much
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:20.400]   to begin with news plus of course is texture reskinned apple bought the magazine company
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:28.000]   and then put it into news some publishing executives uh say that they aren't pleased
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:34.880]   with the layout the magazine centric layout for news content many say they don't they don't make
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:41.600]   much money on it um I have to say I did not renew my subscription I know a lot of people didn't
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:49.440]   I wonder what the issue uh is I wonder if there's a way to save this or if they need to I think a
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:55.760]   I think a user face redesign would help a lot that's I did not get rid of my subscription I kept it but
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:03.520]   I find the the navigation of the news app the news plus section of the news app to be really
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:09.120]   lackluster it really seems like it was thrown together last minute and a lot of things didn't
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:15.680]   weren't taken into consideration um so I think if there were a better design interface I there's
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:21.840]   there's a couple of things it's you can find other services that either cheaper or for free
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:26.560]   can offer very similar things so it's really difficult to convince people to spend 10
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:31.200]   dollars a month on a magazine subscription service when they can get it cheaper or even
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:37.760]   free somewhere else um especially knowing that in this in the very near future we're going to have
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.280]   even more subscription things coming down the pipeline and that we're going to have to be
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:49.280]   worrying about um but I found it to be the content even if the user interface wasn't wasn't designed
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:53.520]   well I found the content to be worth the 10 dollars a month that I was paying I use the
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:34:00.240]   news plus app all the time I love reading magazines so it's it keeps my house free of stacks of magazines
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:06.560]   it doesn't use a paper and I still get to read a plethora of articles from all different kinds of
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:12.800]   of categories and not worry about how much money I've spent on each individual magazine yeah maybe
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.880]   I'm foolish because what I notice on news plus is since I already subscribed to the Atlantic the
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:23.360]   New Yorker and wired I still get those in news plus even though I don't subscribe to news plus
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:29.600]   so it's the stuff I kind of really want I've got but I don't know I but you know what you're
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.960]   missing out on is the things that you didn't know that you didn't know that you loved it all the
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:39.600]   all and I loved texture but I but I just I noticed I don't use it that much so I don't know Lisa's
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:45.360]   mad at me she said you should have told me because I use it all the time so um I you know I don't
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.160]   find myself opening app and Apple News often because frankly I find Apple News to be
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:57.280]   uh kind of oh I don't want to show the team USA score sorry uh case you're that was nice of you
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:04.000]   case you're taping it um but see these are like the first story is a Hollywood reporter story about
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.320]   Carly Claus I don't know why they thought I cared about Carly Claus and then I mean I just it's I
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:19.760]   feel like Apple doesn't do a good job of telling me uh showing me stuff I want yeah that that's that's
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:25.440]   where Apple's putting a lot of work into proving their point about saying we can collect a minimal
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.800]   amount of information but give you the maximum amount of personalization it is still a very new
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:36.560]   field for everybody and so they haven't locked it yet and they're meanwhile they're competing with
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:43.760]   Google News which for me it is it's a great superb yeah because and because I am using the Chrome
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:50.960]   browser I do give I do give Google permission to look at a lot of my life that means that it really
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:57.120]   does continue to surface lots and lots of stuff that I would never have heard of or found unless it
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.640]   just simply appeared in my newsfeed like that and they also make it very very good when it when a
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:05.920]   carteache and accidentally appears in my newsfeed I can say no we've had this discussion no
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:11.760]   and it just doesn't happen so it's but I feel as though Apple is going to get this right because
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:19.040]   they really have stake their reputation on the the viability of being a high privacy company that
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.680]   still provides the same level of service as other companies that are in the advertising business so
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:29.120]   I'm sure that they are working on this and I I'd be shocked if it weren't or as good and too as much
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:34.080]   improved in two years from now as Apple Maps was two years after its release they seem to really
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:38.400]   maybe it's because of Apple's bias towards music they think I want to know a lot more about the
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.800]   music industry that I really do although you know I am happy to see this Britney Spears article so
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:51.760]   maybe they do know you were just giving up they do know what I like you might be too young to
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:59.280]   remember this but when I was a kid they had newspapers what was the newspaper Lori get things
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.600]   you didn't get things curated so your personal taste you just flipped through the newspaper and
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.840]   something found what you wanted read and you know it you probably read an article that you didn't
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:14.160]   think you'd be interested in because it wasn't curated for you so having having things presented
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:20.720]   to me I feel having things presented to me that I never would have sat out providing me with
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:25.600]   information that I never would have thought to look for and when we get enclosed in those google
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.760]   bubbles like that it's it's dangerous because we we get to that matrix level of am I being
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.200]   presented this information because the world thinks it's important to me or because the world
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:42.640]   thinks that this is what I want and how do I know what I want if I'm not seeking it out at all if
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:48.160]   it's always being presented to me so I like you know having things in there that I'm not interested
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:53.440]   in just so that I can be reminded that you know the world exists beyond what I'm interested in
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.560]   well I forget what it was it was I think veritasium and they were talking about
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:04.400]   for a while subscriptions were the thing on youtube on rss and you basically followed publications
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:08.720]   and that meant that publications could count on your views and they didn't have to try to fight
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.160]   so hard for your attention all the time and you would just see what they put out during the day
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.080]   and you would click on the stuff that interested you but a lot of platforms made the conscious
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:20.080]   choice to change to algorithms because you weren't clicking on everything and they thought oh we
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:23.920]   can do better than you clicking on only some things so now youtube and news and all these
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:29.120]   services are algorithmic but that means that the publications can't count on you subscribing it's
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:32.720]   meaningless just because you subscribe we're not going to show you the content that's silly
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.680]   and so now we're back to sort of like the newspaper kid on the thing like here yay
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:39.120]   someone's dying on the corner someone's dying and they're just fighting all the time for your
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:44.560]   attention and I watch one video about something and I have 30 of them in my feet suddenly and you know
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:49.440]   to Laurie's point like there's got to be some middle ground where you're not making everybody make
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.520]   everything the most sensational thing ever but you're also not trying to be a bunch of stuff I really
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:39:03.040]   don't care about so I have booted up my original iPhone it thinks it's December 1999 for some reason
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:11.120]   and I'm now trying to get on Wi-Fi which I think might not oh look at that interface look at the
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:18.480]   music and work as a yeah actual buttons it's not really seeing any uh any Wi-Fi but
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:24.000]   and this has obviously been up to date updated because I do see an app store on here I wonder
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.520]   I wonder where I see the uh here let's go to general about
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:39.600]   um yeah uh version ios 3.1.2 and that's why probably I can't get on Wi-Fi at all
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:46.000]   even though there's a million Wi-Fi signals around here I'll turn off the uh yeah it's I mean that's
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:52.080]   kind of cool to see it again let's see what the camera looks like it takes a long time you want to

[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:49.200]   those days everything's uppercase just like a typewriter thank you apple he had a hook a wire
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.400]   from the shift key to the game port to uh simulate upper and lower case wow okay there's the i- oh wait

[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:10.560]   amazing wasn't there a um wasn't there a calculator bug that's probably still in there
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:16.800]   because this is the old calculator nice 3d buttons there was a version that you could jailbreak by
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:22.880]   going to a tip an alform tip file those were the days those were the days on in safari uh
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:28.480]   eddy q says we watch a lot of tv but that doesn't qualify us as experts
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:35.600]   sunday times and by that i mean the british times which means i can't get into it because it's
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.600]   paywalled but there there that's all i know is that quote

[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:29.200]   best they don't want to do Netflix they said it's not a bad model it's just not our model we're not
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:33.680]   gonna make sense of model is expensive yeah what is Netflix spending eight billion
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:39.120]   billions yeah so is amazon yeah but isn't apple also spending well i guess
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:45.760]   already one billion billion yeah billion just one they're cool like that laura just one billions
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:52.000]   that we only need one one billion one b uh they did say though that they have 60 million paid
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.520]   subscribers now in apple music that ain't bad compared to a hundred million on spotify that's
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:07.440]   that's pretty good all right i'm gonna take a break and uh if you will get your picks of the
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:14.320]   week ready i know you and you and and rene were negotiating apparently with some overlap which
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:19.920]   we have avoided my pick now none of us are doing it is this hot new iphone three and a half inches
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:25.040]   eight gigs of ram of storage you'll never never run out you wanted my phone s e
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:32.400]   looks to be an iphone og og i love it because it's so small so cute i knew you would yeah so cute
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:38.080]   it's tiny packable lorry you would you go back to three and a half inches if you could oh absolutely
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:44.640]   really yeah though you know i i take that back i used to say hands down absolutely but the the
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:52.720]   ten ten s is actually kind of great i i am now sort of in the in the middle i still love the
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:58.320]   smaller phone but i do really like the way the form factor of the of the ten slash ten s
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:04.400]   phone i like how skinny it is it's still a little too tall for me though so i might go back if you
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:09.040]   said if you presented me with a three and a half inch phone i might jump jump on that i might
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:14.960]   have said the twelve will be smaller again oh interesting it might be yeah that's my argument
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:20.800]   is that you know it trends they all come back around and so you know there there was a trend at
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:25.440]   some point to have the smallest phone you could possibly have and you know maybe it'll come back
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:28.720]   it's gonna have the bottoms and a hang light or collar you're gonna love it
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:34.480]   and the other nice thing about the iphone 12 lorry thanks thanks the Wall Street Journal

[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:22.640]   just and show today brought to you by express vpn uh vpn is an important way to protect your
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:28.080]   privacy and your security when you're online in a public Wi-Fi hotspot just read a great article
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:35.760]   uh was it uh bloomberg our business insider where they uh they sent a team of white hat hackers
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:42.960]   to break into a hotel and how insecure the hotel everything at the hotel is especially the open
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:48.240]   Wi-Fi they talked about ways bad guys could see you on the internet see you on the network
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:53.840]   actually attack your computer through the hotel Wi-Fi that's why you use a vpn i think they even
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:59.040]   said any anybody traveling outside the united states ought to be using a vpn and i'll tell you
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:06.080]   what my choice is express vpn here's the reason with a vpn a vpn provider you're really just
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:10.800]   kicking the can down the road the security and privacy can down the road sure your isp can't
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:16.080]   snoop on you can't see what you're doing the the bad guy in the hoodie in the corner of the coffee
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:21.040]   shop can't snoop on your traffic but at some point in order to use the internet you have to
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:26.880]   emerge on the public net and that's where you emerge at the vpn server but you've got to trust
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:31.360]   that vpn server got to trust that vpn company they're not logging you not keeping track of you
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:37.520]   some vpn companies leak your information with poorly configured software some vpn companies
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:45.120]   even inject ads into your internet traffic that's a reprehensible express vpn doesn't do that they
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:50.720]   do not log they do not keep track and we know because of recent court cases they know nothing
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:56.800]   about what you're doing and that's exactly what you want a vpn provider you can trust and man is
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:01.760]   it affordable seven dollars a month thirty-day money back guarantee they've got something new
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:08.160]   they just started it's a cutting-edge technology called trusted server that makes sure there is
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:14.960]   there you leave no trace online you are there are no footprints in the sand to follow back
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:20.480]   that's why i love express vpn stop hackers stop big brothers stop internet companies from
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:26.880]   grabbing all your data take back your online security and privacy use the vpn the only vpn

[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:05.280]   internicing warfare and go straight to lory gill for her pic of the
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:10.800]   well i was actually so distracted by their pic of the week that i forgot about what mine is but
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:18.960]   earlier this week i fix it launched a new phone case that i just found to be so adorable i would
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:25.680]   make a case immediately oh it's really cute it looks like the inside of your iphone they have
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:30.880]   two different versions for each one there's a solid version and an x-ray version
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:37.520]   yeah there it's just it's such a fun little thing that i decided i i needed to get one so i
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.240]   mine hasn't arrived yet but i ordered it uh two days ago or three days ago i'm first here
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:48.320]   so let's see i have a ten s max ten dollars to they're very affordable and you said there's color
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:54.560]   uh but what's the x-ray it was completely oh so i get it so it looks like it's an x-ray
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:58.800]   oh that's so cool i don't know which one should i get
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:04.080]   i thought about getting the x-ray because i actually like the way it looks better but then i thought
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:09.840]   people aren't going to look at the backside of my phone and see an x-ray and believe that but they
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:15.280]   will believe that my that i'm actually using a clear see through phone with that one
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:22.080]   this is so great thank you lori what a great recommendation we should mention i fix it's been a
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.240]   sponsor of our shows we love them and it's nice to support them if you can because
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:32.480]   honestly they're uh they're doing the work of the of the angels helping us repair our stuff and
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:36.960]   fighting for our right to repair our stuff so uh ten dollars it can't be making a lot of money on
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:41.440]   these but that is that is really great you know if you got their tear down wallpaper on the other
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:48.080]   side people would think you had an invisible phone you wouldn't be able to see but you can't see my
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:53.520]   phone can you i'm ordering this right now what a what a great pick rene your pick of the week
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:51:00.080]   so um the the interesting wars have been settled and he won of course but he's been nice and old
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:06.800]   to let me pick something else and this i stole shamelessly from the guys at the accidental tech
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:12.560]   podcast i think it was marco armont uh who mentioned it and it's called mono draw and it takes me back
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:18.080]   to my early days of the apple two plus because this is so cool it lets you draw an asky art yes
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:24.080]   it's just so much fun and there's this that was everything that was i mean because pixels if you
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:29.440]   use low res graphics on apple two plus they were huge um and just and doss and you know all those
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:36.240]   days i just spent so much time drawing in asky art and this lets me recover just also old days of the
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:39.520]   internet you know when browsers couldn't really display that much reforms couldn't display that
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:45.040]   much asky art was just everything and this lets you sort of use real real grown up computer
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:51.360]   sophisticated tools to make real real early days of computer artwork and it's just you can shade it
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:52:00.480]   with ad signs or spaces or asterisks or twos it's so good let me ask you this do you're gonna get
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:05.920]   actually an asky output from this yeah you can like just paste it into anything you want oh man
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:13.200]   oh you look they have a command line version oh it's so good so i could do this on the command line
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:19.200]   oh man this is a back app um and it's a paid back up i think it's worth every penny but i also put a
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:24.480]   link in for the other one they recommended which is a website um that lets you do it's not quite as
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:29.280]   sophisticated because it's not an app but it's a website it's free uh and it just lets you pick a
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:35.440]   tool and start drawing and it's again also just all shades and yes you can tediously go there and
[01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:40.000]   laboriously lovingly with craft make it character by character if you really want just like the
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:45.920]   old days but this will let you get a lot of the heavy lifting done magically quickly and then
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:50.320]   you can go through and painstakingly address it character by character later if you want to this
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:56.960]   is really neat it's so good this is so good yeah so if you just need it once in a while use that yeah
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:03.520]   and then uh oh this is so cool but if you have heavy duty asky art needs yeah then for your heavy
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:12.960]   duty needs so this yeah this is askyflow.com askyflow.com and then mono draw for macOS they have a free
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:18.960]   trial uh it's only ten dollars oh come on buy it that's uh they for the work they put into that
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:23.440]   that's a great deal it's just a it's a labor of love and it will make your soul happy like there's
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:26.720]   few things in this world that actually make your soul happy the way that asky art does uh i love
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:32.720]   asky art and actually if you think about it asky art is going to work everywhere i mean that's that's
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.080]   that is of course you have to have a mono mono space fuck but well what was funny is that like
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:42.640]   in one we had a really boring set of uh meeting threads in mobile nations that Laurie will
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:47.760]   attest to and we started trying to decorate them with like gift gift ifs whatever you want to
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:51.360]   pronounce it and other things and there was just they took up so much space after a while they were
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:55.600]   such heavy attachments that i started sending asky art it was so much better it was so much fun
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:54:01.040]   yeah it takes up in those space yeah on a mail server yeah very cool yeah um
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:09.280]   Andy Inako won the battle he chose the short straw what is your pick of the week yeah uh
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:17.280]   my pick of the week is the marvelous app by the maker of uh p-cal James Thompson uh he created the
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:23.200]   he created a dice rolling app it's called dice by p-cal can all it does is roll dice
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:29.680]   but it does it it does it every single way you would love to like if you're going to spend a
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:36.000]   buck 99 or 299 on a dice rolling app this is what you want first of all it's visually magnificent
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.720]   it it'll do like all uh every kind of gaming dice that you have visualized and modeled perfectly
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:48.880]   using real physics uh the randomization i i assumed that like as with other dice apps that
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:54.240]   i've used that they do that he would use a randomizer to decide okay he's rolling a d20 the randomizer
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:59.840]   size is going to be 17 so now let's use the let's let's model what let's let's use uh
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:04.640]   physics based for the dice rolling to have it come up with that number no what it does it random
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:11.200]   mind it it really works the way that a real die die would in real in the real world so he's using
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:18.320]   a randomizer to decide the the velocity the angle that's the role and so and whatever whatever
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:24.160]   number it comes up with is the number that it reports back uh oh absolutely and of course
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:30.800]   and it's optimized for uh for tabletop gaming rpg so that you don't have to simply get a pop you
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:35.520]   get a pop up maybe to choose what kind of die you want no you've all the different dies that you uh
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:39.840]   that you would be able to use our in a gutter on the on the left it's configurable there are
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.560]   different styles of dies and remember that the one of the reasons that makes uh peak elk so great is
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:50.800]   that yes it's not it's uh he realizes that there's no new way of adding two numbers but what if every
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:54.880]   couple of weeks you come up with a new design for the calculator a new skin or something so he's
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.800]   going to be coming up with is there already like four or five different dice designs he's got to
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:05.360]   be coming up with more uh and uh if this is it's it's it's also has uh another feature really really
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:11.840]   was impressed by it supports uh it's for the iphone and the ipad on the ipad it supports slide over
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:20.240]   so you can have your dice roller on the same screen as your like ios uh rpg game so it's just
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:27.600]   fantastic and he built it based on uh based on like slack chats uh on uh the incomparable podcast
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.560]   uh uh total party kill so i already came went through a lot of suggestions and a lot of betas
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:37.520]   and uh as soon as he announced it lots of people can start coming up with additional like great
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:42.480]   ideas that i hope he follows up on the one that i want is that there's a game that one that we were
[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:49.200]   talking about the the first iphones and the there's a game that disappeared that i've missed ever since
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:55.520]   a company called motion x uh came up with the first uh real physics dice roller for uh for the iphone
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:01.520]   uh called poker quest and i got to tell you for it was um this was this is around the time that i was
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:06.320]   taking care of my mom full time and there's a lot of time where like i'm looking after her but i'm not
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:12.080]   interested in the tv show that she's watching this game got me through hours and hours of like judge
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:18.320]   judy and matlock because you get into the sense of like meditative flow i really want him to do
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:24.080]   like a yazi game or maybe even better if he works you're simply license out this technology so that
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:30.160]   anybody who wants to make a dice themed game can use uh his dice roller on it uh but in any this
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:35.600]   this was definitely one of those uh apps where it's like i just want to give you money to thank you
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:42.400]   for creating this i don't even care if i use it or not this is such a cool thing so yes excellent
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:50.320]   excellent excellent stuff as usual this is where you really go ahead it also has um it feels it has
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:55.040]   tectile feel to it so when you roll the dice you can actually feel your phone kind of click a little
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:01.440]   but it's really fun wow this is great this is where i just sent it to my dnd group when somebody is
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:09.280]   a good programmer this is where you really appreciate it because uh yeah boy that's that's really cool
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:13.920]   oh and one of the suggestions that he is definitely moving on or at least he was trying to do like
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:18.640]   but he didn't have time to do an ar kit version of this so you can actually like roll the dice on
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:24.480]   the table in front of you and i i'm kind of hoping he he makes me buy a new copy for that because
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:29.600]   that's another two or three bucks i really want him to have i want i want him at some point to be
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:34.960]   buying a coffee and him for that three dollars that he spent on that coffee do have come from me
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:40.960]   to basically say aims you are you are i like the cut of your jib young man i shall follow your
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:48.320]   future endeavors with considerable interest uh james uh if even if you're not a dice fan or dnd fan
[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:55.040]   james was using this uh to play with catalyst so he's got a mac uh version i guess he says it runs
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:59:02.880]   really well in an i-mac pro uh yeah but it does you put throat 10 cores or something like this you
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:07.680]   never know anytime apple creates a new technology he figures out a way to put it into p-calc and then
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:12.800]   make a delightful addition to it well p-calc always had a had a dice roller in it right so but not a
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:17.200]   physics simulation and an AR racing game which i think is not what you expect not when you'd expect
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:24.080]   when somebody is as a really uh great coder you can see it they get there they they flow because
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:28.800]   they they get an idea they see something they can do it and they can implement it and it's just
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:32.880]   he's an artist he wants to pay you know like whatever the new dollars are he wants to paint yeah there
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:37.920]   are there are so many people that you can tell that they just have this massively powerful creative
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:43.840]   engine inside their heads and they simply attach the drive shaft of that engine to various things
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:48.480]   for him it's programming that if they were a hundred years ago he might be a sculptor and be
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:55.120]   one of the most amazing and weird sculptures ever uh or one of the pb-b-b-b developing spacecraft that
[01:59:55.120 --> 02:00:02.480]   would be oh that actually will get our astronauts to the moon much faster and much more safer because
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:07.280]   we would never have thought of taking out the seats that was a good idea all right awesome yeah
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:14.240]   he he he is a god whatever whatever whatever the MacArthur genius grant is for developers i
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:18.320]   i would definitely want to give him a couple yeah and one for the car one for the house one for the
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:24.000]   RV Jason's well you know what everybody can do that just buy a copy of p-cal exactly you know that's
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.840]   the way to do it subscribe it's one of those apps i tore up my promo code and just went and bought it
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:33.760]   because damn it that meant it's coffee yeah absolutely absolutely uh and Jason Snell thank you Jason
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.480]   tweets i feel somehow responsible because i am and of course it was on the incomparable his podcast
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:44.480]   that this uh that this all came up so they get up to mischief those two yeah i love it i love it
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:48.800]   that's kind of mischief that is that is the best kind of mischief we were talking about security
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:54.480]   and somebody in the chat room pointed out uh the uh website i forgot to mention patrick wortles
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:01:03.520]   rate website objective c dot com o b j e c t i v e dash s e it's kind of a pun on objective c the
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:11.200]   coding language mackintosh uses he has a number of free security tools uh that you might find
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:18.240]   useful free and open source so wortles well known in the security community he's a great programmer
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:25.920]   and uh he says as max become more prevalent so does o s ten malware and uh he doesn't you know i
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:30.720]   think i support him because he doesn't necessarily believe that you should make money on anti-malware
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:36.560]   stuff so he's he's giving this away uh if you go to the product page free max security tools at
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:46.240]   objective dash s e e dot com from the great patrick wortle so now i think it's time to wrap it up
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:52.880]   you agree i got i got everyone it's an everyone's personality i got some dordash dude i got i
