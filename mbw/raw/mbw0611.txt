[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.160]   Renee Richie from Montreal and imore.com hello Renee. Hello you've got a yellow
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:07.720]   just Mac break assembled. I'm just playing along also Andy and I go from
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   the beautiful in Otco.com I H N A T K O dot com and the celestial waste of bandwidth
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.640]   that is his website and from the pixacore it's Alex Lindsay. Oh I like the shot this
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.880]   is nice you've got our stuffed armadillo behind you. Well you know it's it's it's
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.880]   it's important for most shows to have a stuffed armadillo of any kind it's
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.720]   a very popular here in Virginia I'm in Virginia. Yeah I'm at Sweetbrier College
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.960]   visiting Aaron Mailer a friend of mine. Oh nice he's anyway he's got the armadillo.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.560]   He collects armadillo apparently. I don't know if he collects armadillo but he's got
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.720]   one. He's got at least one. Welcome gentlemen. On this fine day as we prepare
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.160]   just two weeks from WWDC we're kind of trying to figure out what's going to be
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.160]   happening at dub dub DC. Just the beer bash this year they're just going to do
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.960]   the beer bash. Just the fun just the fun the press has been invited. Good news.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.240]   Did you get your rights? Yes sir. Yes of course you did. Tim Cook calls you
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.000]   personally. Said we would be very disappointed if you know. Does he know this
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.280]   earlier does he not care about WWDC until he has to take the stage? That's a
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.800]   good question. They don't worry Tim with his little stuff. That's probably true.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.760]   June 4th I'm hoping it would be by the way 10 a.m. will be the live stream 10 a.m.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   Pacific we will as usual be talking over it. That's a Monday and a second
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.640]   around here. Yeah and whoever whoever's not going is glad as welcome to join us.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.760]   San Jose, California at the McHenry Convention Center. That's where the WWDC
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   is. I'm hoping we all are hoping that we will see new MacBooks there. We'll
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:16.720]   certainly see iOS 12 Mac OS 10.14 TVOS 12 watch OS 5 and Siri predicted a new
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.400]   brighter series as well. 90% sure that's the same Texas last year. Oh really is it?
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   What you might think it was probably the next 10 years do it's like well
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.960]   series is gonna get a little smarter. I mean with all of this stuff every year.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.640]   What should I ask Siri to demonstrate this? When's WWDC or what are we going to
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.560]   see at WWDC? What are we going to see at WWDC? I'm so excited. You can find out
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.760]   all about Dub Dub Dub Dub D site on Apple's website. She changed it. The PR team got to
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:59.120]   her. That's what happened. What can we expect at WWDC? I'm so excited. You can find out
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.400]   all about Dub Dub Dub Dub D on Apple's website. A few days ago she said something
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.000]   like I'm going to be smarter right? Yeah and she was going to get a new home
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.600]   in a nice mesh house which sounds like that was the actual home pod release not
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.440]   the WWDC thing. But why do you think they took that out? Because it was a long run.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.400]   No I'm sure we'll get a whole slew every year they put up a whole slew of
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.680]   them. Some people were probably just poking around before they were ready and
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.640]   then we'll get like the WWDC app with its hilarious fake session names and all of
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.880]   series. Oh yeah that's right that happens too. According to SINNA in the Apple
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.800]   Supply chain the company's preparing a less expensive $199 home pod under the
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.840]   Beats brand. That would be a good time. That sounds totally likely. I absolutely
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.280]   have that's I don't know. Yeah that's it. I tell if we're reduced to rumors at
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.760]   this point that's all we can do. Well yeah well it's because Apple if Apple were
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.440]   another company they could definitely do that. They could simply build a pretty
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.760]   good Bluetooth speaker add an ASIC. Add enough smarts to it to just give it
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.720]   like the iPhone 5, iPhone 6, CPU and take it off from there but they're not
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.640]   going to do that. They're not going to at this point they're still I don't think
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.000]   that they're ready to start devaluing the cost of like entry into the home
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.720]   pod system. Plus why wouldn't they do it like in the if they're going to do it
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.280]   they're going to do it like in the in the fall or the or the winner and try to
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.440]   get some of that Christmas money that they were supposed to get last year with
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.080]   the home pod. According to strategy analytics you know Apple doesn't say
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.800]   how many home pods are sold. They don't break that stuff down but according to
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.000]   Stratton other other others doing quite well sick they say more than half a
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.840]   million home pods sold during the first quarter. That's only about 10% of the
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.880]   smart speakers but still the supply chain stuff is so tough like it could
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.120]   just be a next generation beats pill coming or it could be a beats pill that
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.880]   has the W1 chipset the way that all the beats headphones now how the W1
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.080]   chipset like you see a bunch of schemat or you hear someone talking or you
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.120]   see and then suddenly it's this huge rumor but most of the time they extrapolate
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.560]   99% of it and not all of them know Apple is a company very well so your
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:20.000]   value can vary. Plus is Apple ever like given a beats release like primacy of
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.760]   presentation. I don't think they mentioned usually they ever have even
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.320]   mentioned beats on any of their events. I mean when they when they had the W2
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.440]   chip they mentioned that oh there's gonna be there's a new version of a
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.480]   beats headphones that will pair as easily as AirPods but oh okay it's still
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.560]   but it's best best not the it's not the you don't bring somebody out onto the
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.120]   keynote stage to show off something with the beats logo on it. Yeah yeah.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.560]   Well thanks for joining us on Mac break weekly this week next week. No I mean
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.480]   speculation about what will happen in two weeks. The rumors are that the Mac
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.680]   book Air replacement has been pushed out you know like that's that's the
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.200]   W.C. is famous for that they were gonna launch the Apple TV at W.C. but it wasn't
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.280]   quite ready. So went to September they were gonna launch the Macbook pros at
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.520]   W.C. and they weren't quite ready so they went to October so it's all and
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.800]   especially with the Mac's Intel is having so much so much trouble with 14
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.920]   nanometer never mind 10 nanometer and now I think I fell asleep and I woke up
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.280]   and there was a whiskey lake somewhere between Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake and
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.320]   I can't even keep track anymore but if the Macbook pros are ready for Cannon Lake
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.160]   if the iMacs are ready for a Cannon Lake we could see all those spec those
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.680]   spec boots come that's that's not an unusual device. With the Apple TV you know
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.240]   when it didn't come out it ended up to be a much more developer-centric you
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.920]   know developer conference so I think that there's there might be some
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.320]   advantage to having it be something that you know if they don't have a lot of
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.360]   the big hardware to release so there's some advantages to for the developers
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.040]   to have it much more focused on on them. Some years there's no new hardware they've
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:00.080]   done that several times right yeah well also there's the WWDC starts at the
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   as soon as they start stacking the chairs and the in the first keynote
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.200]   them the developer start the developer keynote starts all these sessions start
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.440]   the first half hour and a half of the show is really just for media analysts
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.760]   fans and the public after that that's when the entire show becomes about
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.520]   about developers and that's why we really want to talk about all the
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.640]   different updates to operating systems because every it's it's it's hard to
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.480]   come up with another year when Apple had so much in play at the same time they've
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.280]   already there already been saying that iOS excuse me the new version of Mac OS
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.960]   is going to be pretty much a let's get the fit and finish right and let's go
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.240]   into the back of the drawer to get as opposed to let's roll out huge new
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.560]   features as opposed to every previous WWDC when they have brought Mac OS the
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.640]   love and the attention and the engineering and the advanced engineering
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.680]   that we've come to love and expect but watch OS needs all the new hooks all the
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:08.240]   new hooks for for health the iOS has to there's iOS TV OS all this sort of stuff
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.360]   that needs to like have it's I believe it's all coming towards a convergence
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.600]   point sometime next year or the year after that where as opposed to being with
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.200]   the same logo and having shared features it really seems like Apple is trying to
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.520]   build towards like the one the the one ring to rule us all so to speak so this
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.680]   could be a really big WWDC for stuff that people are that developers are
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.160]   gonna have to know about if they're gonna have a good time developing Apple
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.600]   hardware and software over the next two years good well said Andrew just want
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:48.880]   calendars on my home plot OS update so was it just so I'm just to clarify is it
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.440]   the same thing series that last year you were making a joke no I think I think
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.080]   serious as she's getting smarter for several years in a row I don't think
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.280]   that's okay so really isn't it okay no but they almost always like a week or
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.560]   so out they put a whole bunch of serious responses I just have fun with I was
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.080]   just not getting I wasn't getting anything interesting also remember the
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.000]   series series isn't like any of the other OS releases new features just
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.560]   simply show up there's nothing to install this and also dangerous for
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.760]   Apple's if they really want to get people to understand how good this thing is
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.560]   there is no like new new dingbat on the screen to know when they restart
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.280]   their when they restart Siri for the first time a screen to hello Siri is new
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.160]   would you like to let's spend some time getting you used to the brand new series
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.400]   features no you just hear from you just you're at somebody's house and you hear
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.640]   them give a command that you've never heard anybody give Siri before and
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.040]   that's how you learn that Siri now knows how to like warm butter for the
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.200]   waffles it's also make you my Apple TV and I think that I think that that's
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.400]   actually one of the thing I think one of the one of the genius things that Apple
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.720]   did with Siri read more recently was what was the quote unquote ad with the
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.400]   rock which was really a training on how to use Siri yeah you know because
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.760]   everything that he they showed in that ad was was all the stuff you didn't
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.840]   know you could do yeah exactly and and that was you know making sure that
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.760]   you're getting the full value out of the product which I think is you know
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.000]   what you know there's I think a lot of a lot of companies don't take this
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.640]   seriously enough you have software development and then you have hardware
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.760]   development and what most people skip over is wetware development that's a
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.880]   training the users on how to use your product you know most of us don't and we
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.480]   get a microwave and we don't know anything about what it can actually do
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.360]   I mean I just want to know how to put the time in and then I move on but if I
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.520]   knew how to do that and how to make it I might think that it was twice as
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.000]   valuable as it is and so it's actually one of the cheaper ways to do
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.400]   development is wetware and I think that that was one of the great things about
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.560]   those ads and I think they could probably afford to do a lot more of those to make
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.240]   sure that people are really getting how useful it can be.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.560]   The rock is so like you come to the kitchen.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:05.440]   Okay and even then then then they're running. I'll jump in and mediate.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.600]   The rock Renee said that the rock is likable and then Andy what were you
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:21.120]   gonna say? No I'm just all I was gonna go off on is just that I forget it's
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.640]   probably. Oh geez Louise. Oh my god.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.240]   I already said it. No. This is so much room for basic stuff like I remember
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.400]   before you say Siri take a selfie it would turn on the rear camera and that
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.840]   was just not helpful. Now it at least turns on the front facing camera but like
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.120]   Siri turned on my Apple TV it doesn't now Siri is yelling at me but it doesn't
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.000]   do that like there's Siri turn on the flat layer there's so many but I would
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.680]   call low hanging fruit that they could just round out the existing feature set
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.560]   and of course you know do everything they can to get that one Siri know that
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.800]   must be living in eddy cues closet that's never updated and gets one 20th of all
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.040]   my requests and doesn't doesn't answer them. So anyway to answer the the query
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.680]   about whether these are new or old these according to Chance Miller I missed
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.680]   this yesterday in nine to five Mackey said these this is series summary from
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:14.320]   2017's WWDC so it's not if you ask it about 20 WWDC 2018 you get what I got
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.280]   which is nothing so yeah so they probably fixed that now which is why
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.240]   that's what happened they fixed it yeah oh never mind I missed this story but
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.840]   that's but but even when they write these jokes remember that these aren't just
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.840]   engineers and their downtime adding little quips no I imagine to have to
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:37.080]   get them again they have no they have writers who just like just just like
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:42.240]   the late night comics have like have monologue writers for them Siri has
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.480]   writers for them. Do you think that's a job there's like a job? Yes.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   Writing and that whips for Siri?
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.400]   No absolutely it's part it's part of it's part of making Siri sound a lot more
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:01.080]   human so that you'll want to interact with if interact with it a lot more I
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.680]   mean there's the Google zone voice was synthetic voice was darn good three
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.120]   years ago but there's a reason why they kept working on it to add more
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.600]   inflections to add more context when it needs to tell you something but a
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   human would probably up inflect at the end the reason that when they started
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.640]   programming it to to speak wrong because humans speak wrong which means that
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.560]   you're more inclined to want to talk to your virtual assistant as opposed to
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.480]   just simply setting an egg timer and that's what oddly enough that's one of
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.680]   the little subtle things that makes separates a really really great
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.520]   personal system from a very very good one or simply adequate one.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:44.840]   Oh my god 2013 courts job description we're looking for a
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.520]   uniquely creative individual this is from Apple on the Apple site help us
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.480]   evolve and enrich Siri our virtual personal assistant
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.880]   Siri is known for quote her quote wit cultural knowledge and zeal to explain
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.160]   things in engaging funny and practical ways the ideal candidate is someone who
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.800]   combines a love for language wordplay and conversation
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.920]   with demonstrated experience and bringing creative content to life
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.320]   within an intense technical environment so this is yeah I checked they filled it
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.400]   this job is no longer available I'm bet you there's more than one
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.120]   I bet you're right you know the the one of the ones that's always like
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:26.920]   open the pod bay doors is it used to get used to elicit probably five or six
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.560]   different responses you know ranging from you know that's an insensitive thing to
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:37.560]   say to a to an intelligent agent to I can't do that right now to you know
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.760]   and if you kept on asking or she would just get more
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.200]   you keep on getting more responses and so but my kids love those times of
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.760]   things and they'll sit there and and I think that it's important that you
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.680]   start they start talking to them and and very subtle things as Andy was talking
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.280]   about you know when you call in if you call into a hangout and you use the
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.120]   phone connection into the hangout the there's something about the Google
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.560]   voice it's like you're the first you know you you've called the right number but
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.200]   there's no one here yet and and there's like this confused like subtle confusion
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.400]   that happens that's funny every I don't know for me it's funny every time I call
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:14.440]   in I just a little touches like that do make a difference yeah yeah yeah it's
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.520]   it's when you do a side by side by side comparison between these voice assistants
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:24.840]   it's not just it's not just okay this one was able to tell us the the year of Don
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.160]   Naughts's third movie and how much money it made in Canada
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.000]   okay that's kind of nice but really the really something as simple as
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.120]   do I need a jacket today or is it going to rain tonight
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:42.600]   that these three systems the Shlomo, Alio Shah, and Guillermo
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.840]   they all have a different way of way of responding to you Guillermo
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.920]   Google will the Google Assistant will say nope you know you won't need to
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.880]   it won't it's not supposed to rain tonight it's not good it's gonna be cloudy
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:59.000]   when better to them but it might be rain tomorrow so that's as opposed to
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.200]   the weather the weather for Boston, Massachusetts is moderate with
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.760]   chances of cloudy I'd so this is the whole new job category I would love to
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.000]   be the writer for Syria I am 30 convinced that Andy and Akko programmed in the
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.560]   response for can you rap to Syria really is it really is it okay no because
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.480]   I don't because again that job lift I found out about that job lifting after
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.720]   it was filled and nobody you know said hey Andy by the way here's a job where
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.960]   you just basically train a train a robot how to be a wise ass
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.400]   a job that you've been training for all of your life I think I think we get
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.760]   18 years as a younger little brother to sisters
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.520]   I think I think we get Andy and Akko we get Merlin Mann get a couple other
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.160]   folks and start throwing them the questions that they need to build
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.200]   responses to and I remember that Syria would be a trip
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.760]   yeah but yeah but Andy Andy and Merlin in two in the same room answering
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.000]   you know writing up about five or six answers to something would be
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.480]   the key key to the us got one on all the water
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.680]   let's go on the window okay here goes I wrote this one myself
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.840]   apologies in advance to the sugar hill gang I said a hip hop saved me from the
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.640]   clippy the peak peak and pop and you don't stop
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.240]   space rocket to the pong pong a doogie stay up jump the doozy to the rhythm of
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.160]   the game he wrote this this sounds random
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:23.480]   I couldn't say it once again this is this is finer this is finer
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.400]   points the finer the the finer points of writing something like that would be
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:32.280]   he could Syria cannot say that like in a robotic tone it has to be
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.640]   I don't think Apple has the same skills at prosody that Google has shown
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.080]   with the go up and all that they're not down with the streets as I are
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.600]   who did that's the job I want to to to do to teach it voices and
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.560]   inflections and things like that that'd be kind of cool
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.920]   well there are several hundred job openings I just checked
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.200]   for a Syria engineers but I didn't find one for writers so maybe they've got
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.840]   the team team they already have the team let's take a little break when we come
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.760]   back
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.280]   I don't know we'll find something
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.560]   there's gotta be something north or
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.600]   campus for Apple we could talk about that
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.360]   Apple's bought new pants recently let's talk about the big function of our
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.960]   pants yes uh tax we could talk about taxes tax
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:27.880]   news yawn uh jason snell seven phone features I'd like to see in ios 12
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.760]   why not it's a it's a little it's a little
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.520]   apple pulling apple pulling call kit apps out of china that's probably the
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.880]   biggest story we'll talk about that and lots
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:48.040]   having contemplative week this week how long is it before we get we'll be
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.160]   wishing for this at the second week and up to weeks two weeks from
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.640]   yesterday uh our show today but we got a welcome back slack
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.000]   love slack collaboration hub that lets you organize your teams working
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.720]   easily searchable channels so many teams use slack i'm sure your
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.600]   team does if it's not why not whether you're organizing them along
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.360]   projects you know because you want to keep a team working on the project
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.000]   together and in touch or interests or by office or
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.280]   you know always what the point is all the right people are always in the loop
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.600]   relevant information it's all in one place
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.640]   so the history the search is slack is phenomenal
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.720]   new team members can easily get up to speed it's so much better than email
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.760]   that's why every big company now is using slack
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.560]   they connect the tools and services you need in one place they just announced
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.800]   by the way slack buttons one so now you can if you've got you know a panoptic
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.880]   alert that's showing up in your slack you can respond to it right from within
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.400]   slack which is awesome you can organize your team with real
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.920]   time messaging and video and voice calls and group file sharing and searchable
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.400]   archives all in one app that looks gorgeous it's beautiful
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.840]   slack saves time improves productivity no more switching across multiple tabs
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.680]   and platforms to keep updated with your work and of course it works with all
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.760]   of the tools you need jira and salesforce and zendesk and google drive
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.000]   more than a thousand apps and is it mobile heck yeah
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.840]   mobile apps for iOS and android that sync seamlessly so you always
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.960]   know what's going on you're never in uh in a mysterious way
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.680]   you can pick up where you left off no matter where you are
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.960]   and your data is absolutely secure
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:39.000]   slack it's where work happens learn more at slack.com slack.com
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.440]   we use it we love it hey leo this is this is my oops
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.000]   hold on i was going to show you my what we were looking at the slack this is my uh
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.680]   yeah oh look at all those groups holy tamoli
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.880]   see that's part of the challenge though is figuring out uh
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:01.240]   how to break it down right well what we what we do uh so we're on the whole
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.760]   company on slack so um well there you go and uh you
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.800]   break up we basically build private a lot of private channels we don't have a
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.520]   lot of public channels and so all those private channels so one
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.000]   event that we might be doing what we've broken up in there'll be a
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.560]   there'll be an overall channel there's a producers channel that's only the
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.040]   producers there's a technical channel for the technical guys
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.400]   there's oftentimes a stream channel and so there we build those channels and
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.120]   then you know some people will share the channels i see all of them
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.360]   but uh but generally keep everybody in the same just in the conversations they
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.160]   need and then there's general channels that we build almost everything again
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.480]   and for us because for security reasons is
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.880]   is all uh everybody's in only the channels they need to see and then there's
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.840]   general company channels that we put into it that are
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.480]   things we're trying to improve or big projects we're working on
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.240]   um and you get used to it and you know at the beginning it was always like
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.600]   like i don't understand my producers got into it and i didn't like it
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.480]   and i was like but before you then you start using it and
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.280]   you can't live pretty soon you can't live what happens but you can't like you have
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.880]   to have it then you start sending me short emails and i'd be like why are you
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.720]   sending this on email and so uh and it just your email
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.200]   becomes you know your internal email becomes not
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.240]   existent and you just really have it all in there and it's just so much more
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.680]   sane than that it was before and then you can always always add external
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.880]   clients you know into channels or or other people that you're working with
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.840]   into single channels or or multiple channels and it's just
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.680]   it is no one's out no one else has figured it out as well so far
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.880]   yeah i think that someday somebody will write a business school study on how
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.240]   slack has actually changed how organizations work i mean how that
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.720]   it's really literally changed how how they're organized
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.440]   you know they just got the right mix you know that a lot of people uh you
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.800]   know there was jabber there was chatter there was
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:49.000]   everyone knew yammer yammer and and and and you know
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.520]   messages and everything else and and it was just there's some kind of magical
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.520]   mix of uh of technologies that came together they
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.400]   you know and that's the kind of the magic of twitter or the magic of of
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.080]   slack is they had just enough complexity to solve the problems people needed
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.800]   and not too much complexity that it was hard to learn and
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.080]   and it just you know there's a lot of people that were trying to for years
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.600]   trying to to skin this and they're the first ones that really just
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.880]   got that magic mix right i wonder how much it has to do with stuart
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.600]   butterfield because he of course was the his story is fascinating he started a
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.200]   game company which ended up being photo the photo
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.520]   sharing website flicker and then sold that to yahoo and then
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.720]   did slack and in both cases i think he has some
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.400]   some magical touch in the design that makes people just very uh excited
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.000]   about using it did you see i think this is very good news that
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.760]   oath slash verizon has sold flicker to smug mug yeah yep it's good
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.240]   yeah very happy the macaskals uh don and chris macaskill run
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.960]   it's kind of like a family business at smug mug
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.760]   uh i've used them for years to share my photos it's kind of
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.000]   you know my preferred photo sharing site but it's not free
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.400]   and i've always you know i've felt like flicker has been neglected for years
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.480]   and is still despite the neglect i mean you if like you want to do a flicker
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.200]   slideshow you have to use flash like that's like nobody's looked at this in
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.440]   five years but uh it's still the best one of the best places to get people
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.240]   commenting and we use flicker for our tech show so
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.280]   i feel like i'm thank god uh the macaskill the good sense to pick it up
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.760]   i mean i don't i i you reason why i'm still using flicker for like my long-term
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.680]   storage and when i'm posting photos and photo albums that i kind of want
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.880]   people to see is that it's the only service that
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.800]   understands that maybe you want to say more than one sentence
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.680]   about this photo yeah maybe you maybe you've got two paragraphs of stuff to say
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.440]   about the aliens who landed on top of the washington monument
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.600]   and started teaching cows how to tap dance maybe you can't just simply say
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.120]   who what a day in dc today huh question mark it's
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.080]   you know and so their their time should i i'm yes it
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.160]   it's blogging is kind of one of the many things that flicker was
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.160]   doing very very well but they weren't able to react fast enough when
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.920]   tumblr gave you a faster way to do a bloggie sort of thing
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.040]   and they were all set to be instagram before instagram figured out that well
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.120]   what if we did flicker but quick and fast i know you have to feel like that's a
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.960]   fumble on yahoo's part they they could have done instagram yeah
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.480]   yeah well i mean you know i'll yeah could have done every every
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.440]   everyone's a genius with access to a time machine but right
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.240]   but i think i think that's hard to get somebody
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.320]   oh go ahead go ahead Andy don't i was done i just think that's you know i
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.920]   would listen to there was a i guess uh there was an interview with that i was
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.240]   listening to i don't know where i was listening to it with the instagram
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.520]   founders and it was just it's a it's an amazing
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.160]   uh you know process of a lot of these these unicorns or or these companies
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.720]   come out of this kind of someone experimenting with something and they
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   just happened to hit the right thing you know the
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.000]   founder was saying that he had this idea that people could share it and his
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.480]   wife said well i probably won't use it because i'm not very good at photography
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.400]   and that's when you you know you should add some
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.440]   film you know then then that's when they started adding the filters which
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.800]   you know that is what made instagram you know what it was at the beginning
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.680]   people felt like they kind of covered their fourth on this whether it's
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:20.760]   just luck you know serendipity or there's some there's some skill involved
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.880]   the butterfly that's a little bit a hundred million things yeah it's about
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.600]   it's about throwing the right thing at the right time and being able to hear it
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.040]   i think that for a lot of people it's a sense some vision
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.720]   it's because i remember the first time uh sarah lain showed me instagram
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:39.160]   when i had just launched and uh i fell in love with it instantly
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.680]   it was just something about it i just didn't like the square photos
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.400]   i was like uh that's because you're gonna want to take a picture for your
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.760]   love leo yeah anyway i think i think it's i should
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.520]   think it's part of the just part of the inherent disadvantage of being a large
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.560]   company you just can't get around it i mean uh
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.240]   some of us i'm sure in this conversation i'm sure many of us listening
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.760]   have been in the situation where you're writing a piece of software or a service
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.840]   or a tool or a thing for the two people or the three people who really really
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.600]   need it and in the case in my case it was a friend of mine who really needed a
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.080]   type of app that wasn't being made at all and maybe for your parents it's that i
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.360]   there needs to be a way to make sure the coffee maker is turned off
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.440]   before i leave the house and when you listen to just one person
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.600]   and every time they come back at you and saying when i try to make it do this
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.720]   and it didn't work and then you find a way to fix it or
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:33.240]   i got this i was using it and i really wanted to do this why don't you add this
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.120]   to it that's the only way that you wind up with
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.800]   something that is unique that fills a hole that did not exist before
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.840]   even when you multiply that but instead of one or two people
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.160]   to 20 or 30 000 people you have the ability to simply listen to
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.600]   look at how they're using the thing make it work that way better and then
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.640]   listen to people when they tell you what they wish it could do better
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.240]   you know you can't get into featureitis but that's when you start to realize
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.000]   that here is a hole that existed in software or services
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.440]   that now this is the only thing that will fill it because it's been built to fill
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.400]   that hole specifically and then at some point it gets so
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.280]   people realize my god i always wanted something like instagram this is
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.360]   wonderful and then you get so big that now if you can't change it because
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.080]   your eight million users are going to complain
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.400]   because your square button is now a rounded rectangle button
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.480]   and you can see exactly how usership actually dove down because you added
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.320]   rounded corners and maybe you're maybe you're less interested now
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.560]   in figuring out a way to make flicker work with mobile devices
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.800]   actually believe it or not instagram has added two features today
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.880]   yeah they finally added a mute feature which is instagram is one of those
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.040]   things i guess twitter is like this too where
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.400]   sometimes people will just start posting like 20 photos a day all of a
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.240]   sudden and just being able to mute them for a day without
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.520]   unfollowing them that would be nice right just for that
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:59.800]   period of time and the one i'm really that's gonna that's not necessarily
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.320]   there on your account yet but once it's active you can just hit the ellipsis
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.480]   on a top right of anybody's post and say mute
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.920]   and then you could say do you want to mute only photo posts or stories or
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.360]   both and then i don't know if it times out but at the
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.000]   end that the theory is you could untime it at
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.320]   certain points and then the other thing that they're looking at which i love
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.800]   is f you know i hate it instagram became algorithmic of course that's the
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.720]   facebook influence is no longer purely why is it not purely
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.880]   chronological i don't know but they favor stuff i don't know
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.760]   it's again it's a miss they think it'll hold you on the screen longer if they
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.400]   show you things that are more likely to appeal to you knowing
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.120]   but what they are especially when it's like an event in it come to this thing
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.640]   now i'm right here now i'm using it two days that was two days ago yep
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.040]   but now they're going to have a thing or at least they're testing a thing that
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:54.440]   forty when you go forty eight hours deep it says okay this is forty
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.520]   this is two days later and stop you've seen this now
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:03.000]   which i think is a good idea i wish they just go back to sir at least give you
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.560]   a chronological switch at facebook does that is isn't as bad as nothing happened
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.320]   anywhere more than forty eight hours ago it's 2018
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.760]   it's over the news cycle has moved on get over it
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.880]   they also did a weird form of regrams people were asking for regrams for a
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.440]   long time so you could just basically retweet the photo but
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.200]   you can't do that but now you can take uh photos i'm when shared and put it in
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.800]   your story not on your timeline but in your story and add a little comment to
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.080]   it oh that's nice see that that's that's
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.720]   that's approximate to what you want right and of course there's a whole bunch of
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.000]   articles about how to make sure that people can't do that with your
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.080]   uh picture you know that's what came out right after that that's funny
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.680]   i've said this is this is the point in which i have to go to the public library
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:49.080]   to where all the senior citizens go to learn about how to use the computers
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.080]   the difference between wait what what's the difference between my story and my
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.720]   time i just want to post this to instagram so people
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.240]   can see this scrambled egg that i had with the spinach in it
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.640]   like what what it's not it's a story am i telling a story i still don't know what
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.560]   the difference between those two things are i don't i don't know i don't use
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.880]   story the story is like a direct response to snap
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.640]   yes because everybody wants to be a star of their own reality show and and
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.400]   snapchat let you be the star of your own reality shows now instagram i ask
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.000]   people all the time do you look at these stories and everybody says yes
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.800]   yep i don't know why they seem so boring
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.240]   i need a fire follow better people i guess
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.920]   celebrities are lit leo the celebrity stories are just lit are they lit
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.400]   they're lit they're lit i can't get enough of that that's what that's what
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.840]   instagram means to me it's like celebrities posting pictures of them like
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.800]   pushing things against their faces and then putting hashtags
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.960]   ooh my skin has never been more radiant ever thank you
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:53.640]   sony disc man melley disc player like okay why why are you pushing why are you
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.680]   pushing this chalupa up against your face and not eating it
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.840]   yeah
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.520]   uh apple cracking down on call kit in china
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.600]   you mentioned this uh rene and i think it is a
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.880]   worthy story we've talked a little bit about it on some of the other shows
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:15.640]   this is uh call first of all call kit does what that lets you make video
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:20.360]   and voice calls in so we'll call kit yeah so what call kit does is allow
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.640]   uh voice over ip apps like skype it's probably the one people are most
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.800]   familiar with but a lot of apps have this capability
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.600]   and it lets them integrate completely with the phone app so for example they
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.400]   can use the phone app interface the phone app dialer
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.840]   they'll be listed alongside your phone calls when you go to the recent call
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.320]   section in the phone app it basically makes the third party
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.920]   voip apps first party citizens on the ios phone
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:46.040]   so it also has encryption yes and i think that's the reason that the
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.800]   chinese regulators uh does it does it have encryption or is it
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.240]   is it enable companies that have encryption to do
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.920]   china is anti-voip because voip circumvents the
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.640]   communications channels they control and call kit
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.240]   allowed apps to have the voip like apps to be integrated into the phone which is
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.320]   not something china wants so we chat which is hilarious had to remove
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.400]   the call kit functionality and then they demanded apple remove any apps that
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.200]   didn't remove it from the app store and apple has
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.520]   that because they because they can't distinguish a call from regular data
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.640]   so they can't figure out where like who you're calling
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.280]   your um some call services are encrypted some aren't like skype
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.280]   famously had a a man in the middle option uh it depends on the service but they
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.320]   just didn't want anybody using any service that they didn't have direct
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.840]   access to apparently it's sure our fd i would like the
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.960]   same thing to be honest right yeah that's what that's what
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   worries me about this yeah they they would really love it and it
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.920]   really does again i i've said this before in the show but i really wish that apple
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.320]   pays attention to making it really really clear what their positions are on
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.280]   all these things that they seem to think are important and all the all the big
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.920]   issues that i'm sure they're going to hit out and uh
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.600]   uh on at ww dc like what would happen if they're
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.240]   they're they're their fallback line is always well we
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   we have a policy of complying with whatever the local rules and regulations
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.480]   are does that mean that if china said oh by the way we
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.080]   we basically now we've now decided that every time we confiscate a phone the
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.360]   blossom somebody we need to be able to get everything that's on that phone so
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.160]   you're gonna have to give you have to give us a new version of the o s that
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.440]   has a backdoor that we can that the government can access so we can
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.480]   basically make sure that encryption is not a problem for us
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.360]   would they draw the line there and say no i guess you're just not going to be
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.360]   able to buy phones in china or are they going to say yes sir yes ma'am of
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.960]   course we'll do that and then that which should send a chill up of the
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.680]   spine of anybody in the united states that this is why it's an
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.240]   this is why it's an important issue to make sure we are
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.200]   keeping tabs on which apple is doing in china because
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.320]   at some point is apple going to fight the government and say
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.040]   guess what no we're not going to do that and we're going to
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.640]   we are going to let you we're going to die on this hill if we have to because
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.640]   we have decided that we are not going to let
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.920]   uh... we're that we're that we keep saying time and time again that
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.760]   personal privacy and security is really really important we've been using this
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.200]   this book to hammer at google and facebook and we hold ourselves to the
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.760]   same standard so no we are not going to comply with this law
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.640]   and we're going to fight we're going to basically tie it up in legal channels for
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.760]   so long that it will never ever come together until we get
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.200]   you know lawmakers who are at the common sense to strike this down
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.360]   or are they going to simply say we don't want to have to stop selling phones
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.080]   it turns out that when we said that we believe that this
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.720]   this policy is really really important we said
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.000]   under most circumstances that don't interfere with our business
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.600]   so that's why this is not the same situation that's going on in china right
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.440]   now again it's just call kit but it seems as though every time that china has
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.880]   asked them to do a way to do that
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.440]   uh... use apple's power over its platform to make sure that
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.960]   the iphone and the iowa's platform is never inconvenient for government
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.320]   sensors in government or the government uh... spying
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.000]   they said sure we can do that no problem and and ironically though not in the
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.440]   u_s_ where they fought the fb_i_s request to unencrypt that phone in
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.120]   sandwell i mean so my my understanding is that
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.200]   no so my understanding is that uh... again apple has been
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.920]   apple will always obey the rules of the local government so if they say you can't
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.720]   have porn apps you know that the apple doesn't have any way but if they said
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.040]   that they've removed them you can have e_p_n_ apps
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.320]   um... i'm not sure like people like to talk about china the biggest problem i'm
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.760]   honestly not sure right now because the e_u_ some countries they're like france
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.640]   are incredibly gongho about getting access to data
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.800]   europe uh... england has incredibly aggressive laws one of the reasons that
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.480]   apple and micro software signatories on the or or or we're supporting the cloud
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.120]   act was because one of the provisions in the cloud act said that government's
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.840]   won't pressure companies to put back doors into um... their software which is
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.480]   one of apple's primary concerns it's worried about that with the u_s_
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.080]   government with the french government with the chinese government so i i think
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.640]   it's it's good not like i think it's all this is all good stuff to talk about
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.040]   i think it's really important that we don't also just focus
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.840]   on china because there's so many countries doing so many scary things
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.600]   with so much of our privacy uh... but i think that that is an interesting point
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.400]   and i think apple has said in the u_s_ they draw the line at modifying their
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.120]   software they'll do the things that you know they'll take things out of the
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.520]   app store they have to but they won't modify their software
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.320]   and whether it's france or china or the u_s_ one of those countries is going to
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.680]   ask them seriously legally uh... with legislation
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.240]   to do it first and i'm gonna have to see what happens yeah the reason they could
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.840]   say no in the u_s_ is there was no there weren't compelled to there was no law
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.520]   yeah they were just asking for it and that and that is an excellent point a
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.080]   lot of these uh... the u_s_ in many ways is so far beyond what the united states
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.240]   is doing in terms of ensuring that citizens of the internet have rights
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.880]   to their data and rights of their privacy and rights to
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:40.120]   how they're abused by the internet on the other hand a lot of that is a very
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.920]   very much a very a lot more hands-on
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.920]   uh... as far as the what the government can tell a company to do or tell what
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.760]   a private individual can do which i'm not quite so uh... quite so happy about
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.040]   uh... china is in it keeps coming up because i think that they're sort of the
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.640]   canary in the coal mine that's
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.880]   what if uh...
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.520]   the china could happen in the united states if we have just three
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.200]   just two presidential administrations that are
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.440]   under the pewton or under the pewton mold let's say as opposed to the george
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.560]   washington mold and so this is the sort of stuff that work
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.080]   might be fighting about and if you think that it can't happen here think about
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.640]   all the things that are happening today that you thought could never happen
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.880]   united states so
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.960]   uh... but i also i mean i'm sympathetic with any company because you don't have
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.240]   a lot of choice you either adhere to the laws of the country
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.120]   or you withdraw from that market
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.360]   which is what google did which which
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:38.040]   to google's credit although google uh... was able to because it was a services
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.960]   company maintain a lot of its services overseas for chinese citizens
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.160]   they weren't selling phones in china for exactly
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.720]   uh... on the other hand i mean china is the first really big nation to start
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.320]   saying we want this i mean the the reason you can say you could say no to
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.800]   france without a huge economic uh... downside but saying no to china
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.560]   is saying no to a billion
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.240]   honestly and this leave blackberry had to install squid servers right several
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.040]   uh... south east asian companies that they could monitor bbm traffic it's
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.400]   something that keeps coming up
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.200]   apple has said repeatedly and they've been consistent that they
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.920]   like their doctrine is too engaged they believe that by pulling out there no
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.760]   longer part of the process and can help
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.960]   effect change and that works until it doesn't but so it reminds me of my
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.840]   generation of s when we finally gave up
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.680]   protesting the war we said i'm gonna i'm gonna help change from within
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.000]   which is basically just i give up
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.120]   well but also just go ahead alex hold on second go ahead alex
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.840]   all i can say is that the one thing to remember though is that that all these
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:39.000]   things are software solutions if you know if uh... if china really put the
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.800]   beat down on an apple decided it didn't want to
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.560]   uh... you do it you know it would be a flip of a switch or a
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.880]   you know a few bits to um...
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.680]   allow all those phones to close close up
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.160]   you know so you know i think that china is not
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.480]   uh... necessarily ready to do that either i i i don't think i think that they're
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.280]   they're not ready to pull that trigger as much as apples not ready to pull that
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.600]   trigger
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.040]   i was just gonna say that that that that that again another good point by
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.160]   by verney a lot of human rights organizations say that it really
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.720]   doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.320]   that a company like google a company like apple company like facebook can help
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.520]   the people of of people who are being abused by a government
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.520]   by at least having some sort of presence inside that company so that
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:26.440]   at least some of their technology will be available to these people
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.040]   uh... mike my concern is that at some point
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.080]   again where is the line that they refuse to
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.440]   they refuse to cross at some point they're going to say you've been doing such a
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.760]   good job of building this a building that for us
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.760]   we now want you to start building tanks for us right at one point at what point
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.680]   do the cut does does gm say you know what we really don't want to make
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.160]   tanks for your army right now and for that reason if means we cannot be a
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.200]   business in your country that means we can't be a business in your country
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.600]   or do you say sure
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.520]   well i know nobody's trying to build smartphones for north korea
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.640]   well people were put in over the military contract so it happens within
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.600]   companies as well as with the company and then there are layers and there's also
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.040]   negotiations and and the united states has leveraged with
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.600]   china over tariffs so it's a it's a you know it's a complicated
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.480]   issue it's not apple fighting on its own
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.080]   well and it also seems that apple has has the the line that apple's drawn so far
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.880]   is is not to get access to the phone
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.680]   you know that's been right let's hope they can get that line
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.120]   well that's us the problem is is that they they don't give up china if they
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.840]   if they do that they give up the ability to do that everywhere
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.440]   so you know the united states you know the fbi would pounce on any
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.560]   if apple let down its guard and actually let
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:43.720]   allowed access to the phones by by any any other government the fbi would
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.760]   would be on that immediately trying to force them to do it they and it would
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.840]   look very bad if they said uh look apple do it for china but they won't do it
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   for our own country to protect our own country
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:57.480]   that would be very bad disastrous so i i think that apple would have to
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.240]   fight that vigorously and probably not back down because it's their business
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.120]   model and they they've they've bet so much on privacy
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.720]   that that's there i think it's good i think that that's been a huge advantage
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.760]   especially lately i think that it does mean that they
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.400]   they can't back down i'm sure they're praying that it doesn't come to that
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.560]   i mean one of the issues that they apparently had to navigate when they
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.440]   did the cloud at where they did sorry the data retention in china because
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.160]   many companies just want they no longer want the data of their
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.440]   citizens to be held outside the country and in some senses that's that's
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.560]   sinister because it means they have greater access to it but another
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.640]   another way is you can see their point like they don't want
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.160]   french data stored on us servers where the us government has access to it
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.600]   but one of the things that apple i think was thinking about was it's not just
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.280]   security like we all think about security but as you know dave nanian
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.840]   pointed out to me that i'd never considered that a lot of people
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.560]   retention is the most important thing not security they don't care
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.600]   someone steals their baby photos but if those baby photos are lost their lives
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.480]   are over and there's a whole bunch of backup services that are
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.520]   attached to a lot of these devices that apple sold along with these devices
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.640]   that just let you keep your data not even security that just let you keep your
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.920]   data up to date or on devices or or sync to your computer
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.960]   and if you pull out you remove all those services from everybody who has those
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.040]   devices so it's always it's always a very big balancing act
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.520]   we're interested in interesting times there's
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.400]   amazon who's apparently trying to sell its face recognition technology
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.520]   so law enforcement in the united states
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.320]   they say uh oh we we're really good at this and uh
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.520]   if you if you want face recognition we could help you out or land a police
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:32.200]   department has bought it so as the washington county sheriff's office in
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.120]   organ
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:40.600]   and uh now the aclu is uh today the aclu says uh they've
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.600]   stopped selling this image recognition system is called recognition with a
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:49.640]   k in a very kind of dystopian spelling to law enforcement
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.080]   that's very much approved gothco would approve
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:57.560]   uh are they going to charge a post office double if things change
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.360]   what a world we live in i you know it's just i don't it's uh but this is i mean
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.080]   this is just the beginning it's there's going to be
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.400]   we talk a lot about this these days uh we've got biotech chrisper coming along
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.840]   so fast we're gonna have some major ethical crises
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:18.200]   ahead and dilemmas um they've got surveillance dilemmas privacy dilemmas
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.920]   uh technology's racing far ahead of our ability to kind of figure out what to
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.320]   do with it i know i think i think that the future of
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.880]   these conversations i mean what we're gonna be really talking about is not
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.640]   what can we do it's whether we should you know and and and the ethics of it the
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.360]   moral is gonna have to yes but we're gonna have to make those decisions
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:38.680]   on so many levels whether it's it's do we get surveillance do we
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.760]   use that surveillance do we use people's dna through their relatives to find
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.800]   someone who a perpetrator do we um but also uh do we allow someone to die
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.160]   i mean you know at some point we're going to be able to keep people alive
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.960]   forever you know like no matter what happened to them and the question is
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.280]   is that is that appropriate we're now getting past
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.400]   we we we're getting past we could do everything we could do
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.440]   i mean we we because what we everything we can do is probably more
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.440]   more too much more than we should yeah and so and so we're gonna have to on
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.720]   so many levels in the next 50 years have to make decisions about what we're
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.760]   going to what we're willing to do yeah and that's a well entirely different
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.880]   more conversation i think the i think the real issue is going to come down to
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.440]   how much money do you have and so there's already a gap between the
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.080]   the haves and the have-nots but imagine now
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.160]   if uh i mean there've been a few movies about this haven't there uh you know
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.960]   the people who have the money can have smarter children better looking
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.880]   children and then uh you know perpetuate their uh
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.880]   they're really well i'm already noticing that the the relevance of you know so
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.520]   like washington post and new york times have started to put
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.560]   paywalls i don't really care they're about their
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.680]   their news enough to to pay for it so i but i've noticed that now they don't
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.960]   seem relevant to me because i don't right you know people post those things on
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.680]   on uh facebook and that you hit it the first couple times then after that you
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.160]   say oh it's it's a washington post thing i'm not gonna bother
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.800]   because i'm not going to hit some paywall and and now you're ending up with a
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.200]   group of people that are going to get a one set of news
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.440]   and then frankly well i've chosen i always from the beginning chosen ad model as
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.920]   opposed to a paid model this is more democratic it's more open it's gets the
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.960]   i think it's important to get the information out
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.760]   and i anybody it shouldn't be a you shouldn't be
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:18.040]   your access to to information should not be
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:23.720]   limited by your access to money at least to a certain point
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.920]   yeah but but but back to back to this i mean i'm
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.200]   the it's one of the things that kind of scares me about future applications
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.440]   the technology is when tech like this becomes really really inexpensive
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.960]   like the the new york times piece was saying that uh
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.320]   the test beds the test sites for it was only spending
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.920]   a few hundred bucks to set it up and then like AWS which only caused it was
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.360]   only costing maybe like five bucks a month to actually run it
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:52.600]   and at that point you get into the you get into the realm of well if it's
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.760]   that cheap why wouldn't we put this in just like uh
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:01.240]   20 years ago if it were if the if the local if local law enforcement
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:05.320]   had a really really important reason to keep an eye on
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.080]   this road that runs parallel to i 95 because they think
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.520]   there's been like a a string of home burglaries and the burglaries have
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.800]   been using this road that means they would make the case for
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.320]   themselves and for the courts that it's important for us to actually park a
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.520]   cruiser on our cruiser with some people in it
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:26.200]   and cameras to actually record who's going this way and that
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.080]   and then to analyze it and then figure out what to do with it
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:34.760]   and but but in the in a in a in a world in which you can simply buy
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.120]   imagine you can just put put together like a 30-dollar Raspberry Pi
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.800]   at a hundred bucks worth of hardware on it just send someone out there to recharge
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.320]   the battery about every two or three days and you're simply collecting
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.160]   every single license plate that comes by or you're collecting every single
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   face that comes through uh that comes through the the the the food court of
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.440]   them all uh and the the additional problem with that is
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:00.600]   that now all that information is in a database somewhere and it's owned by
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.000]   just so this the owner of a dry cleaners and if a police officer comes to a
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.760]   detective comes to that place and say we're very very interested in just the
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.640]   seats in the in the spreadsheet the google spreadsheet file
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   of all the people that were recognized by your face ID system over the past
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.200]   month are they gonna say no probably not so this is where
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.360]   hell on earth comes and we don't know exactly when the portal to hell was
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.160]   opened well and the thing is is that it's it's gonna be
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.200]   to get back to the complicated questions that are gonna happen you know what's
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:34.840]   what's coming uh which is already available to some folks is
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:39.240]   but if you think about the school a school security uh imagine cameras that
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:43.320]   are looking outward to every entrance to that that school
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:46.840]   every person that does those cameras can see it looks that identifies who they
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:50.040]   are it looks back at all of their social postings it looks back at everything
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.400]   that they that they've done publicly and makes a decision about whether
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.360]   someone should go up and talk to them before they even get to the school
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:00.360]   entrance and and that is given what's just happened um that sounds great
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.720]   really hard it does sound like to say no to isn't it
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.120]   exactly and it gets to a point where that kind of you know that kind of
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.880]   solution this is what amazon is going to sell towards is you know sure it's
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.240]   that ironically in this article the new york times that oh and by the way we
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.760]   used that same technology during the royal wedding to identify
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.600]   guests so it's being used in a variety of ways
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.920]   not all bad the uh the spokesperson for amazon said amusement parks had used it
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:32.840]   to find lost children uh i mean it's not you're right it's not all bad uh i
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:36.680]   was talking to somebody i was talking to somebody about about disney and uh
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.000]   you know disney world uh i i was i always said i don't like to go to
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.720]   disney world because i it was a form someone who used to work there and
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.120]   and i said i don't like to go disney works i'm only afraid i'm gonna lose my
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.720]   kids and they they said oh this there's nothing there's no place in the world
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.520]   that is safer to lose your kids than disney he said uh they you know they're
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.560]   basically unless you're going to the bathrooms uh you're pretty much
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.320]   under camera you know and uh and they can find out the kid and then they just
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.880]   rewind back to where you were with the adult and then they go forward to where
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.320]   they'd go find them and bring them over and i said well how often do you have to
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.400]   do that and they're like oh 150 times a day jeez low weeds you know like you know
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.000]   yeah i mean you know but you know and and for disney is a good example there's
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.040]   you know there's facial recognition as you walk into right just the world
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.640]   looking for predators yeah we used to we used to get upset because they uh
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:26.200]   the disney pass asked for your fingerprint they don't eat your fingerprint anymore
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:31.000]   that's so old school but for them there's a there's a billion dollar problem
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.960]   multi-billion dollar problem one kid you know is is a bill you can't let a predator
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:39.160]   from disney world and it ruins the whole company you know ruins that that whole
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.400]   thing and and so they they spend a lot of money on making sure that that you're
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.160]   very safe at that location you know and and i think that the hard part is it gets
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.520]   back that what Andy saying is completely valid that we get to a point where this
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:54.680]   is too far the problem is you end up with you know world where we think that we
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.400]   can fix everything that every time something goes wrong or something
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.120]   horrible happens that there should be there should have been a technology to
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.400]   fix it or there should be a lot of fix it we're going to get into a position
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.440]   where you have parents that you know that are going to say you know we're
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.160]   going to sue the school if it doesn't put in security that makes sure that our
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:15.000]   kids are you know taken care of and and then so that technology starts going
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.240]   out and once you did it there why don't you do it everywhere and then you end
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.000]   up in a situation where everybody's tracked all the time and that's a probable
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.480]   outcome it should also point out that you mentioned
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:28.280]   that the the resignations at google the technology that 300 people quit google
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.760]   over was face recognition technology for drones that google was working on for
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.000]   the military people were upset because even though google said well it's only
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.440]   for defensive use people said that's going to be used offensively as well
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.800]   so there so every but this is always the case with technology right it's a
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.720]   it's it technologies neutral it's a tool and it's how it's used it
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.880]   and that's why i think it's i think i'm glad to have seen uh at the build
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.720]   conference uh microsoft ceo satin and della
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:01.560]   bring up ethics google yes to mention that for a fuse
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.560]   or sentence or two but and i think tim cook's very much focused on this
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:10.680]   it's up to technologists to consider the uses of their technologies and try to
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.640]   make it point it towards the good not the bad
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.160]   well i don't know if it's up to technologists i think it's going to be up to
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:21.800]   everybody you know but technologist and you can't you know robin up uh you can't
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.920]   keep technologists out of the loop because when they're absolutely right
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.840]   they're developing this stuff they are the first line of defense against
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:33.000]   bad uses no i i i agree and i think that but i also think that
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.520]   you know we this is why a civilian generally run you know is the
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.560]   secretary of defense that that is making you know and a civilian is running
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.880]   those things that's right is because because we have to make those
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.080]   decisions because you know the military doing what the military
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:48.040]   thinks is right all the time may not be the right decision right you know um
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:50.600]   because everybody has to be involved you're exact yes i agree
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.480]   involved in the conversation i agree yeah and it's going to be complicated and
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.720]   we're going to make a lot of the wrong decisions i mean i think that i mean
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.720]   when i was a kid um they wanted to put the the local stream in a pipe just so
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.440]   that nobody could ever drown in it and then people had to point out that
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.800]   that would destroy the entire forest ecology and they backed down but that
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.280]   was their first instinct was well if we put it in a pipe no one will ever have
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.440]   problems with it right well i just i don't think that
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:16.840]   legislation uh solves solves every problem uh and certainly
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.840]   then in in everything there is danger in excess i just think that there should
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:24.840]   be a happy medium between too much legislation that stifles a
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.360]   technology and doesn't allow it to find its own place in society
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:32.360]   and let's just do absolutely nothing and have absolutely no protections for
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:36.040]   private citizens and hope it all works out okay yeah because it really doesn't
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.400]   that's how p there there there are a lot of a lot more people died in cold
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:44.040]   minds before they said you know what this whole thing about letting employers
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.400]   a cold company a cold mining companies just do whatever the hell they want
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.320]   to their to their employees that's not working out to the tune of 30 children
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.720]   every week what if we had some i don't know some rules that they had to follow
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.960]   if they're going to be in this business and that's
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.600]   uh and that that's where we are right now with uh with a with a lot of this new
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:07.160]   tech uh since surveillance technology uh starting with a basic statement of
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:11.880]   rights what are what are my rights uh so much of what defines uh freedom in
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.320]   america comes from for whatever silly reason
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:20.360]   in the late in the late 18th century it was general agreement that the that
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:24.120]   the prep that you can say whatever the hell you want and nobody can sue you for
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.040]   simply having said something within you know libel whatever slander
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:31.320]   but they're the first amendment that was important enough that it's part of the
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.360]   fabric of the united states second amendment for good or bad
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.080]   is part of the fabric of the united states the ability to
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:41.080]   uh not recruit not to be forced to incriminate yourself
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:45.480]   again all this stuff that it's not stuff that uh that god or evolution
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:49.400]   programmed into our dna it's something that at some point a group of people for
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:53.000]   the power to create laws decided to write that down because it was important enough
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.240]   and that basically uh that's how the first amendment became one of these
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:00.600]   third rails that you have a very very hard time uh to
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:05.320]   uh hard time cracking so we don't right now we've got a whole bunch of new
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.000]   freedoms that we're not even a twinkle in anybody's
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.760]   eye even 20 years ago let alone uh 200 years ago
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:17.240]   and it's um it's interesting to think about how
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:21.080]   we think that a lot of this stuff is so malleable simply because we didn't
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.600]   grow up and our grandparents didn't grow up and our great grandparents didn't
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.200]   grow up with with an amendment to the constitution
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.560]   guaranteeing us this right as part of the
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:34.440]   installation package of american democracy
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.920]   well i think that one of the challenges that we have if we look at the line of
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.280]   questioning that that marx zuckerberg got uh when he was in congress was
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.120]   that we have a lot of people writing laws that
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:45.560]   don't really have any grasp of the technology that they're writing laws
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.680]   about so so the thing that the things that we're talking about that we're
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.360]   worried about i mean i think most of them have a
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:54.520]   trouble checking their email you know so so i think that that's a that's a
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.720]   big big challenge as we start to think about what the policies and
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.640]   regulations should be you have a lot of people that are running uh the show
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:06.280]   that that don't understand what those what those technologies do or or what
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.880]   the pluses or minuses are well we can fix that
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:13.720]   there's an election coming up let me uh let's take a break because i i want to
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.480]   show you i want to cheer things up with a new uh an emoji
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:22.680]   single from apple the south korean group hiyoko are you familiar i'm sure a bit
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:27.640]   rene richy knows hiyoko anyway we'll we'll watch a uh an emoji
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.360]   music spot just a minute i stopped i stopped following them
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:34.520]   when when dave left the grime i know you know i thought dave was the the musical
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.880]   authority the integrity of that group well they replaced him with harry mccracken
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.040]   so everything is good yeah you know uh harry really ought to be getting
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.520]   rallies for these things i don't understand how he's not
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.640]   i showed a brought to you by rocket mortgage if it's time to buy a new home
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.600]   or it's time to refi your existing home you got to know about quick and
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:54.520]   loans the number one lender in the country country
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.200]   number one in volume but also number one in customer satisfaction
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:04.840]   eight years running eight years in a row thanks to according to jd power
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.880]   they realized uh some time ago quick and loans did that the mortgage
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.440]   experience wasn't keeping up with the times it was stuck
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.440]   dated stuck in the uh 19th century they needed a
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:19.320]   technological revolution and they came up with rocket mortgage and hallelujah
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:22.280]   no more going to a bank no more long applications no more
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.840]   faxing information and no more time spent in the attic going through paperwork
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.840]   nope it's easy it's fast you can do the entire thing on your phone in a matter
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:34.680]   of minutes and it'll give you the confidence you need
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.320]   when it comes to buying a home this is the biggest purchase you'll make in
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.840]   your whole life and you it should be simple it should be
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:45.320]   transparent it should be easy and you should understand every step of the
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.640]   way and that's what rocket mortgage does

[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:47.000]   from a korean group that i'm probably not pronouncing properly so i won't
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.840]   and i guess apple produced this using the anemoji technique
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   driving
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:15.960]   that's actually pretty catchy
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.080]   you know how much they spend making music videos and millions of dollars this
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.640]   would be so much easier all music videos should be this way
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:32.600]   i'm suddenly thinking about how much time apple spent debating
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.800]   how pointy the teeth of the i mean i'm looking at the bear teeth they're kind
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.440]   of scary they're a little pointy so are the dragons but the chicken has no
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.600]   teeth as we all know beat this pointy though
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.880]   and you know that bear looks angry they also they also have the dark shark
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.400]   like such eyes of a killer
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.320]   i want them to sing the greatest showman this is not yes
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:02.920]   yes this is not the first anemoji uh musical video apples done they did it
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.640]   for me ghost childish gamby no royal blood and now he'll call
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.640]   that's got a person this is america one it's a little bit violent so don't get
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.600]   into that kid yeah i don't think there's there's no anemoji and this is
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:22.440]   america is there no no that would be too creepy yes yes
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.680]   speaking of a company listening to following the lead of its users like
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.760]   what how far away are we from having that as a feature in i-movie
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.360]   like to add narration that is simply an anemoji oh it should just be so simple
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.120]   right the rumor the rumors is coming to face time at least this uh
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.360]   it's jim right that's easy but i think it should be an i-movie everybody
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.200]   should be able to do this yes without all the effort that harry macraken and
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.120]   rene richie put in it is hard isn't it a lot of work
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:54.120]   rambo from nine to five mac he made an anemoji studio yeah
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:59.000]   well there's an anemoji studio well not from apple from gi rambo it's a
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.920]   it's a third-party app that lets you do a bunch of oh you've got an article about
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:09.640]   it right here anemoji studio uh-huh so this does all the work that you would
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.400]   normally do to edit you know capture it and edit it and all that
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:21.080]   yeah uh nice job guillermo guillerme girme rambo
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.280]   this is this is by far my favorite type of programming
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.120]   like not i'm i'm impressed by servers i'm impressed by the infar- the digital
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.880]   infrastructure that keeps day-to-day life and emergency services running
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.760]   nothing i love more however than someone had a really wonderful silly idea that
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.400]   just had to be implemented by them yeah and yeah
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.320]   specter's back i'm sure we'll be talking a lot more about it uh this afternoon
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.080]   on security now right after the show google and microsoft have disclosed we
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.120]   knew that there was something out there but they have now
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:57.400]   talked a little more about it a cpu flaw the the fix of which can slow your
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:01.480]   machine down by several percentage points two to eight percent
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:03.960]   according to systmark and the spec
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.600]   integer benchmarks
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.320]   um i you know all of the talk in this article is about
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:17.160]   windows but these same intel chips with speculative executioner are running on
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.640]   um on max so i don't know that's not a horrible thing about
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.840]   meltdown inspector is that they were never passed all we did was mitigate
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.480]   the known vulnerabilities and that just means that when someone finds another
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.360]   vulnerability you're gonna have to go back and mitigate that as well yeah
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.000]   and then rinse and repeat forever until the chips change
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.880]   if they get the chip changes right and it sounds like intel is gonna have to
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:41.160]   re-architect the chip changes too so so here's the good news this new uh
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.160]   flaw is called speculative store bypass variant four
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:51.240]   safari has been patched uh for it intel says the meltdown mitigations
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.600]   uh from earlier this year are applicable to variant four
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.840]   so if you're using safari edge or chrome you're you're okay
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:03.320]   um but there are also more specter like
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.520]   flaws that will require firmware updates and cpu's
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.040]   intel has according to this article in the verge already delivered microcode
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:16.200]   updates to oem's which means they'll i guess they're good i mean the first
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   time they did that right for a good yeah you test those before you push them
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.960]   the browser stuff is is good because that those were the most likely vectors
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.520]   for attacking these exploits so if you stop them
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.800]   from in the browser then you stop but me and like it doesn't fix the exploits
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.520]   don't it just makes it harder to take advantage of
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:37.320]   yeah exactly it this is an interesting choice uh the firmware updates will set
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:42.440]   the speculative store bypass protection to off by default
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:46.440]   yes so really all it's going to do is let you turn it on if you're worried
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.440]   about security more than you are about performance
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.760]   i'm sure how good i hope that will come up with something better than that
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:00.760]   like like arm cpu's on max like arm arm uh
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:05.240]   according to again the verge intel future processors
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.900]   CastBaid Lake will include new built-in hardware protections
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:13.760]   See every time every time I fall asleep there's a new lake I wake up and there's too many like and CastBaid Lake
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.600]   I like whisky lake that's the lake. That's the lake
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.180]   Talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk gah gah gah gah
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:25.020]   You see this is this is why people in charge of sites like I'm more are not supposed to sleep right?
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:30.440]   That sounds like a grenade problem not like an entail problem. Yeah poor gina
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:37.380]   Yeah, but it was before it was you know shrink the die and then you fix the architecture then shrink the die fix the architecture
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:41.260]   Now it's shrink the die fix the architecture optimize optimize optimize optimize optimize optimize optimize
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:43.260]   Right and sometimes those optimization is
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:47.540]   One of the most one of the most mind-changing
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.840]   Conversations I ever had with like an engineer
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:57.620]   Well the first time I really got an in-depth conversation with the with a CPU designer and like the first when I'm
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:02.880]   I was hoping he would like explain to me like what basically what the what the job is and like what the
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.620]   Strategies are and he's like you don't understand
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:11.340]   We we are now at the point where we're butting our heads against the speed and the size of an electron
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:14.380]   Like if if this if we can get electrons that were smaller
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:17.980]   We'd be in we'd be in business if we get electrons that move faster
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:22.900]   I could actually see my kids grow up, but no we're stuck with these electrons and
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:32.420]   Like I just sort of had to lean back. I think when you're when when you're big engineering problems is that you wish there was something smaller and faster than an electron?
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.940]   That's a job. I don't want to have
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:39.160]   Here's some really good news for a long time if you wanted to use hardware
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:45.580]   Authenticators with iPhones you had to use Bluetooth you couldn't use the NFC chip because Apple didn't let other
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:50.860]   apps get access to it they of course have a new NFC kit and
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:56.980]   They've opened this up to third-party developers in iOS 11 and for the first time
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:01.980]   You can use a NFC based ub key. I have this is called the ub key Neo
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:07.700]   Which does work on the Android phones using its NFC, but now you can use it with last pass on iPhone
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.060]   I iPhone 7 or later with an NFC chip
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:18.980]   Last pass is the first app by the way last pass is a sponsor last pass is the first app to support that but others
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.740]   Presumably will will follow
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:26.820]   So that's good because it's a really this is a really good way to do two facts second factor
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:32.380]   It's not a six-digit code. It's a it's a physical hardware dongle. I really want an NFC ring
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:38.260]   I guess there is one I've never used it. I don't know if it's here is one. I use it and never worked right now. There you go
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:43.180]   Just seems like having a ring on your hand that is just like it's it's on your hand
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:50.420]   Yeah, so I know this ub key so you there's a lot of different ub keys most of Mac is a USB device and
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.140]   I use a ub key for a lot of my you know most secure stuff
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:09:00.500]   The Neo which is one of it's an actually an older form factor
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:05.140]   You be key has NFC and so you can use it with a with an Android phone
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:09.140]   And now you can use it with an iPhone with that last pass. That's one of the things I use a ub key with
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:13.660]   So that's that's very good news. It's a good. It's a better way to authenticate
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:20.860]   I got something I got something I'm willing to sell you a real cheap. It is my my Java ring
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:28.140]   It well kind of it's it was made for a Java script conference
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:31.820]   Java conference in like the 90s like 2000 like that
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:39.220]   Yeah, it is a complete that button on the top there is a complete like computer with IO clock storage and encryption
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:44.860]   And as a fact on the side it says actually says digital decoded ring because writing stuff onto it
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:48.940]   It's actually encrypted and everything and that was one of the things they're trying to get this technology
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.740]   Get developers interested in this technology
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:55.980]   So you would wear fashionable rings like this or you have the button on a key fob
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:10:01.540]   And then you just like tap on a door to have it let you in or you tap on a coffee machine or a coffee machine to sell you
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:07.540]   could sell you a coke and I have never wanted to technology more than this but like we have NFC
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.700]   It should be able to work, but no one can agree on the best way to make this really happen
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:18.660]   So is that NFC based or RFID based or no, no, it's way way before it's actually one wire it requires physical contact
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:23.060]   It's it's conductive metal of course and actually what would what would happen is that
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:31.220]   When you tap it against the thing the actual metal against metal would create like a one a one channel one bit
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:38.980]   Data lines for serial data, so they would just do all the negotiation in half duplex mode
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.900]   and
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:45.060]   One of the demos they had is that when you filled out your your your form to
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:48.420]   To register for the conference that asked you like how you take your coffee
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:52.180]   And so they have the coffee machine set up at your ring when you checked in set up
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:57.940]   So you had like 10 bucks worth of coffee money on it and every time you tapped on the coffee coffee machine it read from your ring
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.540]   Oh, he takes it
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.540]   Two sugars one cream
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:05.220]   He wants the whatever fair trade whatever you I don't I don't drink coffee
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:11.380]   So I'm in over my head for that and then it would prepare the coffee the way you like it and deduct like two bucks from the ring
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:14.020]   So that's clever
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:18.180]   I wish it's clever. I mean, right? It's also a pretty boss ring. So yeah, you should save it
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:22.900]   It's a bit trick to people are thinking I graduated from high school. Yeah, my favorite computers
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:27.700]   That is that is your smallest probably smallest computer
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:33.140]   I do do you see the story about the uh, we're talking about two facts reminded me that story about teen safe
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:42.180]   Yeah, isn't that shocking? We were talking about that on iOS today. This is an app that uh was used to what for to protect your teens somehow
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:47.780]   It was a way to monitor your children's activity and the iOS version in order for it to be more convenient what it had you do is
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:54.340]   Give them your child's itels kid credentials and fight and turn off two factors so that they could pull the backup
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.940]   From the kids iPhone and then give it to you in a windows app. Oh
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.660]   Well, and then they're breached
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:07.220]   They've been breached and not only they've been breached, but they have leaked iCloud credentials of many teenagers
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.100]   Oh, that's a nightmare
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:15.620]   And you think about I mean that's actually horrific because these are children and now you basically give them to find my iPhone password for those children
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.300]   Oh
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.500]   Terrible
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.420]   Yeah, um
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.420]   I don't know how many people use teen safe
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:26.260]   Uh zeding net says that thousands of user passwords
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:29.060]   were leaked
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.420]   Um they stored it in plain text on an amazon web server
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:40.180]   Yeah, see, I'm an idiot and even I wouldn't design a piece of software like that
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.140]   It's like
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:47.380]   There's there's some people who see like a a skillet on a pan
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:52.740]   A skillet on a stove and they think the only way for me to figure out if that's so hot that I shouldn't touch it
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.820]   It's for me to put it my face right against it
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:59.460]   But most people say I instinctively believe that this is the wrong way to go about something
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.860]   Uh
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:07.940]   Teen safe has pulled both servers offline after zeding net alerted them good for them. Yes. We've taken action
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:12.740]   And then we're alerting customers that could be impacted says teams the website was amazing though
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:17.780]   It says teen safe desktop is a new applet designed to reduce the occurrences of frequent iCloud account lockouts
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:23.860]   Experienced by many parents that uses your home's local network to download your child's apple iCloud backup data to your computer
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:29.300]   And then upload it to teen safe servers the tasty desktop app runs in the background on your macro windows
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:35.140]   PC and is called anytime you log into your teen safe account and click get latest data to on to onboard a new device
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:43.300]   So if you've used teen safe the smartest thing to do would be to immediately change your iCloud passwords and guess what turn two factor back on
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.860]   Yes
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.780]   Insane safe insulted. Yeah, yeah, salt it salt and hash it
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:55.460]   apple has put 1.76 billion dollars into escrow as they begin to
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.100]   fight over
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.100]   the tax bill from ireland
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.620]   the uh
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:06.420]   Irish government uh is asking for 13 billion euros in disputed taxes
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:09.460]   Ireland didn't want to do it the ec made him do it right? Yeah
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:14.020]   Both ireland double and apple are appealing the ruling
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:20.100]   But i i like the idea of you can appeal but guess what?
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:24.020]   If we judge 13 billion dollars against you you're gonna have to put that money aside
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:27.860]   You know so that if you if you lose you're you're still out
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:30.180]   We still get the float on 13 billion dollars
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:34.740]   And if you lose you're not going to be able to weasel out of paying because we already got the dough that's
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:42.260]   That's a good move. Uh, I just think I think it's such an amazing european thing for countries to be willing to let somebody else tell them what they can and can't tax
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.660]   I just I mean this is just amazing
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:50.900]   Is we had this issue with this issue in canada now where some of the laws were written so sloppily that there are a bunch of private
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:55.700]   Canadian citizens who now owe the us government millions of dollars because they had an american parent
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:15:02.020]   And the law is written so that doesn't distinguish between corporate income and personal income and the irs is holding these canadians
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:08.100]   You've never lived in america liable for millions of dollars in corporate profits personally. It has to be paid back asap
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:13.380]   It's like people like nine million dollars. I kind of understand the eus point of view there they basically what they
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:19.140]   You know, if you join the eu the idea is rolling this together. They don't want any member state of the eu
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.180]   To compete with other states by charging
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:29.460]   Ridiculously low tax to the bottom right? I think I don't have a problem with saying okay in the future you can't do this or whatever
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:33.540]   It's the we're gonna claw back for years into something that was well
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:40.340]   It's not something that was hidden, you know, and no, but they said that they were violating the law all along and so that's why they're clawing it back
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:42.340]   I'm not sure I disagree with that, but
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:47.620]   You're right. It's a little it's like to get a 13 billion dollar tax bill years later is
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.260]   Certainly a shock
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:53.140]   It's not like it was but it's not like it was being hidden under something
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:56.820]   It was a bunch of agreements that were all there and and so decide decide okay
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.540]   This is what you know, they've now started to pay attention to it. So they're now saying okay
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:04.260]   You know, it's it's it's an agreement that was I think entered into it fairly
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:08.260]   Straightforward. It's not like someone hid something in a Swiss bank account or in the Cayman Islands
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:14.660]   You know, they they you know, this is an agreement that was between governments and corporations and again saying hey
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.300]   We don't agree with this. We think that you know as a group
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.540]   We can't do that in the future. It totally makes sense to me
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:23.780]   The the part of going clawing back is the part that I'm just like, okay
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:29.220]   Well, there's also the flip side where it's just the us and you tree out of all the countries in the world that charge taxes for money
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:33.860]   Earned outside the com the country like it's like the rest of the world is metric. We're imperial
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:38.100]   The rest of the world taxes you on location. We're gonna tax you no matter where you are or operate right
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.660]   It's it's different environment. Yeah
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:47.220]   Apple thinking about according to ziti net a new campus in North Carolina
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:51.140]   The research triangle
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:55.780]   Carrie North Carolina. This is actually according to wra l, which is a local news channel
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.700]   uh there
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:01.140]   Um, so we knew apple was gonna build a new campus. We just didn't know where
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:05.620]   I don't know it's not a apple park or an infinite loop. It's a tech
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:09.700]   At least at first it's gonna be a tech support campus. So it's nothing to get to right, you know
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:13.460]   Right. Although a lot of jobs for that uh that area and
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:16.660]   Totally apple has tons of these buildings all over the left tax breaks
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:20.820]   You can you can be pretty much sure that there were tax breaks involved
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:24.740]   Not nothing compared to what amazon is demanding. So that's i'm
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:27.620]   And getting
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:37.300]   Let's see
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:42.100]   When it comes to taxes, I mean, you know, like we're talking about kupertino now talking thinking about doing the head tax
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:45.220]   Um, which is yeah, I think makes sense. I mean there's there's a there's
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:47.940]   I don't think that it really costs these these companies that much money
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:51.700]   I think that the for for for an apple or for amazon in seattle
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.380]   This is like a
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.740]   A small item
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:18:00.580]   But what it does do I think is has a lot of companies that are thinking about building in that community thinking well
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.660]   If i'm gonna expand if I think i'm gonna go bigger
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.540]   I don't know if I really want to be here to do that. I don't think that
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:09.060]   How do they tax them if they so they're not taxing by the number of employees now?
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.540]   What are they tax it by the the acreage?
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:15.540]   They're not I mean there you know, they're taxing in the standard
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:20.980]   Whatever the corporate taxes are for that for that area, which I don't know if they're a percentage of revenue or something like that
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:23.540]   Yeah, I don't know
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:27.860]   I don't know if kupertino gets anything from apple other than the fact that there's an awful lot of employees that are probably paying
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:33.380]   Their their local taxes and the you know, there's a lot of people buying coffee there. So there's probably an awful lot of
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:39.300]   You know, coffee state state and local taxes that that come out of sales tax as well
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:41.300]   So it's not like they're not making any money
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:44.420]   On the fact that there's a big there's a bunch of big campuses there
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:49.140]   And again, I think that apple and amazon. I think these are just small line items
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:50.180]   I think that
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:54.580]   It just adds to one more reason that I mean I think that personally I think the south bay
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.540]   In general is an insane place to build a business at this point
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:02.500]   It doesn't make any sense for any company to keep on expanding in that area and you know, so
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.220]   This is just a small
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.100]   Brick in the wall, you know, and I think that we're gonna see
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:13.300]   People starting to you know, they're already starting to break away. North Carolina is not not really a good example of that
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:16.740]   But I think that a lot of folks are trying to figure out how they move to the midwest how they move
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.820]   But how do you create the culture that they want?
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:23.940]   In those areas and so they haven't figured that out yet, but um, but there's pretty big offices
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:28.020]   Like for google and facebook and everything else elsewhere, you know, not in
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.140]   Apple has a bunch of them apple has seattle in texas and may and uh
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.940]   Massachusetts for a whole bunch of places
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:38.660]   Hey, the aluminum smelting the aluminum smelting is being done in matriole and saginay
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.860]   There you go. There you go
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:43.300]   But I think I think we're gonna I think over time we're gonna start seeing a lot of these companies start to
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:48.500]   Move out. I think that these and you know, I think municipalities have to be careful about how hard they push
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.060]   Um and and decide where there's really worth it because it's not so much the they're not gonna affect apple apple
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:57.380]   Just built a big campus there, but they are going to affect the next generation of of tech companies that are
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.100]   Drying islands like those decisions all the time
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:04.900]   They make little islands or or floating bases like cobra commander used to do
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.540]   You know
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:10.100]   Those things make a decision, you know when I when my lease came up in san francisco
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:13.940]   I moved out of san francisco because of the taxes. I mean like let's just flat out
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:18.260]   I just wasn't willing to pay the they they they they hit you up on not just taxes on
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:23.780]   Sales tax or or corporate tax they tax you on every piece of equipment that you own that was in san francisco
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:26.660]   Then I was just like we're gonna we're gonna we're moving north
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:31.540]   You know like and it was literally just that it was that was the decision that that pushed us over the edge
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:36.260]   And so I think that it is something that is worth, you know, it's it's the thing that companies have to
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:42.820]   Or or municipalities always have to weigh is how much how much are they gonna cash in on on the companies that are bringing
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:46.900]   You know an enormous amount of of of people, you know, you you say well
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:52.580]   They're not paying the corporations aren't paying the taxes, but their employees are and their employees are are in that location
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:57.860]   I mean you look you can ask san rafel how how things went when iLM decided to move to
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:04.740]   To letterman and that was partially over being frustrated with the city
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:11.060]   So the the median home price is san oclera county the median the one in the middle
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:16.900]   Is now 1.38 million dollars according to the california association of realtors
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:22.580]   Not the most expensive place though san matao county is leaving a little more expensive
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:28.740]   One is impossible 1.38 million dollars and you don't get much for that by the way
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:35.460]   See and this this also affects like actually just being able to hire the people they want to hire
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:41.860]   Because if you're unless you're unless you're able to hire this engineer that you think you need for a half a million dollars a year
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:46.580]   That engineer if he has he or she has options is going to say I can either eke out
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:55.220]   eke out of a bear a bear scrub level existence as a six figure engineer working for apple who has to live someplace near apple
[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:58.740]   Or I can live like a king or a queen
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:03.060]   On the money that I can get living anywhere else even boston for health
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.940]   For god's sake
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.940]   And this is just being a problem
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:14.740]   Just to say nothing of the damage that they're doing to a community by inflating the inflating price is so high that
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:18.260]   You know, there are people who still have to work at dry cleaners in that town
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:22.980]   There's still people have to work at bagel shops and coffee shops in that town and when a but when a house
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:29.460]   When they when that when an apartment costs three four hundred dollars a month for just not a great apartment not a great area
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:35.780]   A community starts to fall apart and you can't rebuild it very easily. That's all I'm saying
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:44.500]   Apple music crosses 50 million users according to tim cook in an interview with bloomberg television on the david rumin stein show 50 million
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:47.060]   paid and trial
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:53.300]   Uh, that's up from 40 million paid last month. They're at a growth rate apparently
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:58.980]   According to this story by apple insider to have 60 million paid subscribers by the end of the year
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:02.500]   That's with three years of within three years of launch. That's pretty good
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:06.420]   They're they're coming on strong compared to spotify which has 90 million
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:11.940]   Or will have about 90 million paid users by the start of the holiday season. Of course. It has an eight-year
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:14.260]   Head start
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:18.420]   Apple music though. I mean that's a pretty big success at 50 million users
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:21.460]   Of course, you know, I say so good
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:27.700]   Considering there if they're still fairly new right three years old. Yep. Yep. It's the convenience. It's on the phone
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.500]   you know, it really is a
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.940]   It's it's just again. We we talked about on for years on the show that
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:38.180]   That the subscription. I mean apple really seeded that market to spotify
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:42.500]   I mean they they could have flipped that switch five years earlier and owned the market
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:45.460]   So it's it's catch up, but it's it's definitely on its way
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:48.500]   I think we've definitely turned the corner where you know streaming is now the future
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:48.820]   I mean
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:53.620]   I think that everyone was trying to figure out how to keep it away, you know keep from doing it
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:59.460]   um and uh and you know the record industry I mean bands and the record industry was all against it and
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.820]   Now, you know, and I think a lot of us knew that this was going to be it works when everybody's doing it
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:10.980]   When everybody's paying a little bit it act people actually start to make money again. They just don't make any money when when it's uh
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:16.500]   When it was just a small percentage of the market, but I think that we're gonna get to a point where a very large percent
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:21.060]   I think that both spotify and apple could easily hit hundred hundred fifty million subscribers
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:29.140]   And at that number, um, you know at for both of them the the music industry stands to probably make more money than they then they ever made in the past
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:32.980]   Good because they weren't making that much money on radio. Right? Right?
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:41.380]   Jason they might they might now have the ability to squeeze spotify a little bit to say we really hate hate hate hate hate your free tier
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:47.540]   We would love for you to get rid of it completely because now we have now we have tens of millions of paid users on other services
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:50.420]   That are kind of replacing the money we would lose
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:54.340]   But we think we would lose if we simply decided that spotify is now a second
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.820]   uh a second party
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:25:03.620]   The second party outlet for our licensed music so because the music industry hates hates hates hates hates
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:09.380]   Hate spotifies free accounts. You gotta figure it's just a matter of time before they do what apple does which give you you know
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:13.220]   One two or three months free trial, but then you have to decide
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:18.980]   Uh, i'm sure that's what the industry would like them to do and certainly it's worked well for apple conversion rates very high
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:19.940]   I think
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:24.100]   And you know and one of the things that kind of slipped through the cracks was that there were some laws that were passed
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:29.700]   Um, I think in the last week or two that basically closed up the loophole around mechanical rights
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:35.700]   So mechanical rights were something that you could relatively cheaply, um pay for and do a cover cover song on youtube
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:40.260]   Um cover song is the way they're all those cover those cover songs. Yeah, because you can
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:45.220]   Well, and it's like so when you're when you're doing karaoke you probably wonder why those songs are all
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:49.860]   Uh close but not the same band, you know, it's not they didn't just remove it
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:57.140]   They had they had and in vegas they have whole studios that just produced tons of this for um, you know for their hotels because then they don't have to pay the same
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:00.340]   uh royalties so, um and so the the
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:06.980]   The mechanical rights were you know, literally mechanical rights mean for the paper that was going through the player piano, you know
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:10.100]   And it was a very old way that the licensing got set up
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:13.540]   And it was kind of a loophole where you know, whether it was you know
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:17.860]   For all these bands that have been doing covers and then all those cover songs that that happen around the bands
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:23.460]   Which again, which sound really close you look at like a def leopard who wouldn't give their put their stuff digitally out
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.860]   Because of the fight with their um with their label
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:31.460]   Uh, there's all this def leopard, you know, um, you know covers that sound almost
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:37.300]   Exactly the same and uh, and so uh, they you know just closed that up
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.500]   And so I you know, I don't know how that went exactly when it's gonna come up
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:44.980]   I just saw it go by and I happened to know enough about mechanical rights that i was like, oh, that's gonna change
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:49.780]   Everything all these bands that that that are putting stuff out will have to pay much higher royalties
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:53.220]   Um, and so the the music industry to to Andy's point is
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:56.180]   Slowly tightening, you know all all of those
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:27:01.460]   All those screws to make sure that they can maximize, uh, their return
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:06.180]   Interesting, but at the same time the bands are getting to a point where they don't need the labels
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:09.380]   You know, this is that you know, so this is a you know, if you look at a
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:15.540]   Little bands maybe um need the labels or really medium sized bands pop bands need to be produced
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.300]   And they need the money to go in
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:22.020]   But if you're uh, you know, a lot of a lot of bands at this point are getting to a point where they can make make the money
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:24.340]   They can post that stuff directly to spotify
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:29.780]   And if they have uh if they're able to build a social network or if they're already a successful artist
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:32.420]   You know, they're able to sidestep the labels altogether
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:37.540]   And that's you know, that's probably another real challenge for the music industry itself
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:41.540]   Um, is that the their biggest, you know, if they don't lock people down to a long enough
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:46.900]   Uh, you know contract of of six or eight albums or or however they're going to define it in the future
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:51.220]   You know, and alicia keys or you know, or or other folks like that don't really
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:54.340]   You know, don't really need them anymore
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:58.420]   You know, they you know, they can release the stuff directly or a tailor swift and tailor swift
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:02.420]   I think owns a lot of her stuff as it is. I mean, I think she came into that
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.700]   Um
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.700]   Late enough that she figured that out so
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:10.180]   Uh, but uh, you know, a lot of these big bands can can sidestep, you know, all of that
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:13.940]   And I think we're going to see a lot of that. Um, you know, and I think apple's making that possible as well
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:19.940]   While the labels love apple apples also spending a lot of time working with drake and other and other artists to
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:23.780]   Um, really give them a much more direct route to uh, to publishing
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:30.740]   Uh, jacie snell writing for tom's guide the seven features. I want to see an ios 12
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:35.220]   What do you think always on lock screen for iphone 10
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.700]   It's got an OLED screen
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.700]   You know android does it
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:44.020]   Why not have a so I see the time and my notifications on my uh android device
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:46.340]   Uh all the time
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:49.940]   I want complications. I know some android phones do it too, but I just want very small very quick
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:53.860]   Very glanceable information to tell me what's there and what's going on. Yeah, android funds do that as well
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:56.340]   Approved do not disturb
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:02.740]   Hmm, let's see. What is he when he says he says when i'm driving how about filtering out calls that aren't from an approved list
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:04.740]   I think you could do that already, right?
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:07.620]   There's uh, so my thing is that there's vip, but it's an email
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.500]   Level service which means it only applies to email for years
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.740]   I've asked for vip to be a contact level service
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:16.180]   Because that way I could say like when leo and andy call and alex calls
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:19.380]   Always make sure I get their phone calls their text messages their tweets
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:21.140]   They're everything that comes straight to me
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:25.300]   But when these three people that I know just want to sell me something call I don't even hear those right
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:28.020]   And improved notification center
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:32.420]   He says I don't think ios users want all the tweaky possibilities android offers
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.980]   But some moves in that direction would be welcome
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:42.340]   WebOS was so good. Yeah, yeah redesign control center. It's control center every version gets the new control
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:46.660]   Control center. It's kind of gotten out of hand
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:50.980]   More fun in photos
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:56.340]   I don't know about that more workflows in more places now apple acquired workflow
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:01.060]   Yeah, they're on the serie team. I don't yeah, they haven't really done anything with it
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:06.420]   It seems like they just that was an aqua hire. I guess the the engineering teams what they want
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:10.660]   Augmented reality and maps googles just announced that in google maps
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:16.420]   That would have been such a cool thing last year when they announced arkits and we're putting it to work right in maps, right?
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:18.820]   Could happen
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:20.340]   Could happen
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:26.180]   Uh, those are the seven we'll find out june fourth. We're gonna see the new features and there's at least some of them in ios
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:33.060]   I did a video yesterday where I would just talk about facetime because it seems like that's i message is such an important app and facetime is really
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:36.980]   Not and if they did things like conference calling screen sharing
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:41.540]   Call recording and put ar kit into photoshop almost like they used to have
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:45.380]   In sorry into facetime like they used to have in photo booth. I mean there's just so much fun
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:51.140]   You could have with that stuff. Is this the thing now the as we get close to wwc putting out a wishlist
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:53.460]   Face time but they
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.460]   Face time wishlist from rene
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:31:02.740]   Yeah, yeah, here's your chance. It's too late. Of course apple already knows what's gonna do and by the way, I do appreciate your use
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:06.100]   of images from uh infinite infinity war
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:09.060]   in your demos so great
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:12.260]   Only half the yes
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:20.420]   I'd like to show my screen with Thanos you bet uh-huh. I I'm more must be doing really great to be able to pay those licensing fees
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:21.380]   Wow
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:27.460]   It's yeah, it's it was I forget his fair use because I'm not i'm is a derivative work. Okay. Good. I know me too. No
[01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.700]   I
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:30.500]   Yep
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:37.140]   Conference calls ar in facetime. You're talking about that. I think that is gonna happen. That's that's pretty obviously so you know
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:44.580]   That's an easy thing to do. That's been around. Especially if it gets integrated into the camera app. Yeah, I I'm embarrassed to say how much i'm using the
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:47.700]   the stock google camera
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:53.780]   on my uh on my uh my pixel phone has like downloadable ar content and i'm embarrassed at how
[01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:59.300]   Often i'm putting stormtroopers on my on the table while i'm waiting for my breakfast to arrive at the diner. That's
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:03.540]   Uh, all right
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:09.060]   Um, let us take a break and I would like to come back after the break if you gentlemen would uh cooperate
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:11.620]   with your picks of the week
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.620]   It's up to you, sir
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:19.300]   Our show today brought to you by molecule. I was just at lisa and I were just talking last night or maybe it was this morning
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:24.100]   She's this allergies have been rough in petaluma over the last couple of weeks
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:30.980]   She's basically kind of had a mild cold for weeks because of all the pollen in the air except in our bedroom
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:36.260]   She's fine because we have a molecule in our bedroom. It's the world's first molecular
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:40.500]   Air purifier that reduces symptoms for allergy and asthma sufferers
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:47.860]   It gets rid of stuff that no other technology can get rid of if you've been using a HEPA filter that was invented in the forties
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:50.340]   And haven't been any major
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:54.900]   Innovations in HEPA filter since then molecules pico technology
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:33:02.180]   So much better pico stands for photo electrochemical oxidation and it goes beyond the HEPA filter to both capture
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:04.660]   And eliminate allergens
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:07.220]   No more sneezing mold
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:12.180]   That's actually a health issue bacteria viruses airborne chemicals
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:17.780]   Including pollutants a thousand times smaller than those a HEPA filter can capture
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:22.420]   I love our molecule. We we have it running in the studio too at all times
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:25.940]   And I have to say, uh, you know, you could tell when you go out
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:31.380]   Uh, you know, lisa gets up her nose is stuffed up almost instantly after she leaves
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:36.020]   The better but at least she can sleep well and we just need to get more. I think molecules throughout the house
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.060]   Molecule is awesome
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:42.900]   Lisa said she was able to breathe through her nose for the first time in years
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:47.380]   And it's funny because uh, we know it works because we had a double blind test
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:50.980]   Our nephew stayed in our house for a couple of days when we were out of town
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:54.980]   Turned off the molecule. I'm not sure why we came back the next night
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:34:01.380]   At least it woke up in the morning. She said hi. I'm I gonna head it. What's going on? I said, oh, they turned off the molecule
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:08.500]   It does make a difference molecules technologies was funded by the EPA and excites extensively tested
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:16.660]   By real people and then verified by third parties and university laboratories like the university of south florida's center for biological defense
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:20.500]   And the university of minnesota's particle calibration lab
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:23.220]   really pretty
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:24.660]   Really works
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:30.900]   And you get a filter subscription service filters arrive regularly on your doorstep. You don't have to but you can pair
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:37.940]   Uh, the molecule with your Wi-Fi or bluetooth and it will then automatically order filters when it needs them
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:43.140]   Which is really cool, but you don't have to use the bluetooth or Wi-Fi capabilities
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:46.820]   It's not required. They've got buttons on the top, but if you if you want you can
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:50.580]   It's the apple of air purifiers just beautiful
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.620]   And it really works and it's easy to replace the filters
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:59.460]   Lisa did it the other day. We they came and she just boom there and for 75 dollars off your first order

[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:22.100]   We ended up getting one for michaels room one for lisas our bedroom and i went here for the studio mole k ule.com
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.180]   promo code
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:26.420]   mac break
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:29.300]   Really is a worthwhile purchase
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:32.660]   Andy and i co pick of the week my friend
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:37.220]   Mine is a real cheap and real simple. It's almost like an infomercial
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:41.220]   This is the charger to my limpest camera battery
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:45.300]   And this is the power cable that comes with it, which is fine
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:50.500]   But when I travel that means I have to travel with like one of these and sometimes it's not worth it
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:55.300]   However, what I can do instead is I can instead of packing this
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:36:00.500]   bulky cable for seven bucks on amazon. I was able to buy one of these
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:05.940]   Which is a right angle plug adapter that plugs directly into the back of it
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:11.300]   That's awesome and we'll turn it turn any of these things into like a hangable like wall plug thing
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:16.980]   And so it's like my god. That's the simplest idea in the world. How come I didn't know about this until last week
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:20.660]   So yes, and they're they're cheap. They're only like six or seven bucks
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:26.340]   And guess what and I'm very very certain that i'm going to lose them because they're really really tiny
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:29.300]   So after I got this one and found out how well it works
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:32.900]   I bought like four more and so now there's like one and every one of my little
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:37.460]   Diddy bags that I always travel with because it's it's easy to see
[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:44.980]   See the other problem is that I don't have to like scavnage the wall in my office to like unplug like one of these cables every time
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:49.300]   I need to travel with a charger. So with this it's just yeah, it's
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:53.860]   So the seven or eight bucks. That's a nice a few of my charges
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:59.380]   You know have the fold out plugs, but a fewer like that limpis plug where you have a long cord. That's great. Right
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:04.740]   two prong right angle plug adapter us e i e six i e c
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:07.060]   60320
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:10.740]   Stroke c7 receptacle for anema 1 15 p
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:14.900]   If you need to know otherwise known as a c7. Oh really?
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:17.380]   With the right angle. Yeah, that's what they caught
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:20.900]   See, well, it's just that the the the the c
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:26.500]   I it's the c7 to well. I mean what we call it internally is an sc7 to a to a Edison
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:27.860]   That's the other two
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.780]   Yeah, the Edison is the two round ones
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:35.300]   No, the Edison the c7 is the two round ones and that goes in technically into a seat a c8
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:40.660]   And then the one you plug into your computer is typically a c13 going into a c14 receptacle
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:46.340]   You it's uh, and then you know everyone calls them at in production. They call them iec cables
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:50.500]   But it's like well, there's a c7 and c8 and c13 and c14 and these are all
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:53.460]   What do you call it what do you call a clothespin?
[01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:58.580]   The c47 and which is interesting because you have the c13 and the c14
[01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:05.300]   But the c47 has no electrical use at all, but it is important to know what that is and no one really knows why it's called c47
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:08.660]   May i wait make one quick comment
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:18.340]   Stagehand obviously because c7 before t6 was taken that's a greek grip nerd you're a grip nerd
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:25.300]   Well, yeah, you know those are crossing that one is a grip grip nerd and the other one is an electrical nerd. Yeah, you have to
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:28.340]   a gaffrin nerd
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:31.300]   Yeah, exactly. That's not to Alex. What's your pick of the week?
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:33.620]   Don't say c47
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:39.060]   I should have or or possibly a p38 which would not be plain. Um, anyway, so
[01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:40.980]   uh
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:45.860]   I've been playing around with how to get the most out of my uh out of my iphone and I still haven't found
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:50.500]   I just thought I'd bring it up again. I think i've I maybe recommended this years ago, but um,
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.260]   Still haven't found
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:58.500]   an app better than filmic pro to you know to take full advantage of my of my camera
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:02.900]   Um on my phone. So if you're if you're actually want to shoot some uh shoot content
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:08.900]   um on uh, you know on your phone, it's just an amazing amount of of both audio information
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:14.820]   Uh video having control over your color and having that all kind of a heads up if you're going to actually build something out
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.980]   um and uh
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:21.300]   Anyway, it's it's uh, it's a great app if you're trying to if you're going to shoot something and say well
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:26.260]   How much what can I actually shoot with my iphone and and have the controls that you need to
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:29.940]   To do that. I think a lot of times when you're using the regular camera or a lot of other apps
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:31.780]   You still feel like you're
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:37.620]   Falling short and so far my tests haven't found something that i'm that i'm happy with happier with um, so
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:43.380]   Uh, it's been around for a long time and I I kind of went through this process over the last couple weeks of trying to figure out a better one
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:45.860]   But it's still it's still great
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:51.300]   So if you're thinking about trying to how to how to shoot content and you really can shoot an enormous amount of content
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:55.940]   Now with just your phone, um, it's uh, you know
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:00.820]   You need you need an app that's going to actually give you the manual controls that that are probably a little bit more robust than
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:04.900]   Then what you get with the standard uh camera app and uh, and this is probably
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:10.340]   Still in my opinion one of the best jolly good jolly good
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:17.860]   Alex, can i say a case a serious quick question now that there is an actual ship date for the red hydrogen one phone
[01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:23.220]   Are you interested in it as a camera or as a controller to any of your red cameras or your fine one?
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:25.860]   I already have a pre-order
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.860]   I ordered it the day it was
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:33.780]   Real questions get the titanium model for 1600 bucks or I did not I was that was too much. That was just a third
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:38.180]   So so I did not get the titanium model. I I ordered the first day it came out
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:43.780]   I I went ahead and put it. I haven't received it yet, but I but I I'm waiting for waiting for it to arrive
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:48.100]   I believe we're getting a review unit. So we'll but the problem is it doesn't it doesn't
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:52.100]   They have pogo pins in the back, but they haven't yet announced what they're going to put on there
[01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:55.060]   I'm presuming it'll be other red stuff, but
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:41:00.100]   Yeah, it's a lens mount right? It was a really you build up any lens on it in theory
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.500]   Well, I'm I'm really fascinated by the the process of
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:08.900]   Being able to have stereo face time, you know between other people, you know
[01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:11.780]   So because you have those you have the two cameras on both both sides
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:16.340]   You know, I think that there's going to be some interesting interesting possibilities. So it'll be
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:22.740]   I'm fascinated by it. You know, I it's I don't it wasn't I didn't jump early with with the first red
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:27.860]   But I've I have owned a lot of reds and um, and you know, it's always a cool
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:31.940]   Picture of the future, you know, uh, and and you know for some of us worth
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:33.700]   uh
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.340]   Worth staying ahead of it. So it's it looks like it's gonna be cool
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:41.940]   I don't I don't have a crazy high expectation of it other than it'll be something new and and I think we're gonna see some
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:45.860]   Touch of the of the future of of phones
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:49.940]   Um, you know when we see it because I think that this you know moving into this 3d realm
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:52.580]   I think is definitely something we're gonna see more and more of from these phones
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:55.380]   nice
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:57.220]   uh rene richy pick of the week
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:02.020]   So, uh, my pick of the week and I think andy will appreciate this
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:06.820]   Johnny, I have an apple for some reason has not seen it fit to give us purple iPhones yet. I can't explain this
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:12.180]   I just have to live in it. So russell holly my good friend russell holly found these cases on um amazon
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:17.380]   And it also gets rid of my p20 pro envy a little bit at the same time
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:22.500]   And you can get these in pink in blue and in purple and I went and got it in purple
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:28.340]   And it gives you like it's really a minimal case and I don't often wear cases. So you know, I got to want the purple bad
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:33.860]   Um, but you put it on and it's very thin and all it does is really give you this nice metallic
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:38.980]   Uh, I don't know what the right word is for the way that it refracts the light, but it just it's a very attractive
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:43.620]   iridescent case iridescent. Yeah, that's a good one. I'm not holographic
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:47.300]   I can't call it holographic, but it definitely when you get those blues and purples going
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:50.580]   Uh, it looks really nice f love me
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:53.540]   luxury slim fit
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:43:02.020]   gradual colorful gradient change color ultra thin lightweight electro plating bumper anti drop clear hard back cover holders
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.660]   words purple
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:06.660]   Smash our tashions beeper
[01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:08.020]   38
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:14.900]   80 white Canadian. Yeah. Yeah, that's expensive, but I guess oh that's like three american dollars. I don't know. Okay
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:20.020]   That's that's only 80 percent of a watch band. So that's you know, yeah, no
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:24.020]   Yeah, so rustle got the blue one georgia got the pink one. I got the purple
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:26.820]   Yeah, yeah
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:32.740]   I should mention that one password has put out its first paid update in five years one password seven
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:35.060]   Uh for mac just came out
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:38.820]   If you're one password user, you might want to check it out
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:46.100]   It is not a free upgrade. It is their first paid upgrade in a long time. It looks like I have some nice features though
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:53.780]   I know a lot of you use it if if you have a version six license, uh, it'll be $50 for upgrade
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:44:03.220]   49 99 65 dollars after the special upgrade period. I wanted to mention something kind of crazy
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:07.620]   Which is uh, so this this this fella here
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:10.580]   designs sound
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.300]   it
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:13.060]   Ili jack or iliac
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:18.500]   And uh, he feels like the sounds available for the iphone
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:24.900]   Don't take advantage of its speakers. So he analyzed the spectral capabilities of the iphone speaker
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:31.380]   And came up with absolutely free. Although you could donate a euro for a cup of coffee if you really like it
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:39.300]   These are ringtones and alarms designed for the iphone. You want to hear a few of them the iphone speaker. They're all very scinthe
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:46.020]   But he says, you know because they take advantage of the iphones
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:49.220]   Speaker they're going to sound better
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:53.220]   They're very stereo
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:57.060]   Ili jac.com/extras
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:02.180]   And when you download them they come as m4r files. I'll just uh
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:06.180]   I'll just play one off my very Yamaha dx 50
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:13.300]   They do have that dx 50 sound like 1980s like action comedy movie intro music. Yeah
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:18.740]   They do they do they have that that feeling you want to hear some of the alarms sound pretty good
[01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:24.340]   That would be a nice way to wake up
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:31.060]   But again, you're not you're not hearing unless you're listening to this show on an iphone
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:35.860]   In which case you're hearing exactly as it's going to sound but it's you know, that that is an art
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:39.300]   I mean, I I use the sleep as android app as a wake-up alarm
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:44.820]   And it's and really 50 of it is it has such a great like wake-up tone
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:49.060]   Yes, where it doesn't just if you're if you're a body wake-up anyway, it will gently
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:53.860]   It doesn't it never blasts you just simply at some point. I know that you will wake up to this
[01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:56.100]   I'm just going to keep going until you wake up
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:01.060]   You need jack. Ili jac. Whoa hello

[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:32.420]   Who's on vecture? Well, I have some good folks coming up
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:38.020]   This week on the latest video. I just put up was I finally got the keyboard failure on my macbook
[01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:38.820]   No
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.820]   By 2016 macbook pro
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:45.700]   I did a video trying to try to fix it and hilarity and did you fix it after testing three macbooks?
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:47.220]   I'm a little
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.100]   A little I mean it's if I hit it hard from the right angle
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:53.700]   It's the control key so it really only bugs me in terminal and in the emoji interface
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:57.300]   Um, but i'm gonna take it into apple and see what happens still on your mind
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.220]   You know, that's that's really surprising
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:03.380]   I was pretty sure that apple would have made sure you get that earlier before everyone else you could write about it
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:08.660]   No, you know that that's the fine thing is people are like oh and have and like I would prefer to have every problem right away
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:12.020]   Because like it's the same thing all all these shows are better if we have the problem
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:12.820]   Right, right?
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:17.620]   I can try to like troubleshoot it. I can try to fix it. I can say what we're when you don't have it and people are asking you for a fix
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:19.460]   It's really frustrating
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:23.460]   And I just I just want to take a certain amount of pride that I I didn't jump on the
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:28.180]   MacBook keyboard hatred bandwagon. I put the wheels on that wagon
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:32.580]   I was there on day one bolt of them on I was greasing the axles
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:37.060]   Hey, I actually traded in my macbook
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:39.780]   Pro I couldn't take it
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:44.100]   So I have I have a couple of them because I have reviewed units too and I use a couple of them all the time
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:46.980]   I've had it on the 2016 one the 2017 one still fine
[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:51.220]   But it's newer but my thing is and I say at the end of the video is whether it gives me a problem or not
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.220]   I think the fact that people like Andy
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:55.860]   Can't use it is a problem in a single vendor product
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:49:00.340]   Like you just you can't have divisive single vendor products because you can't just go to HP or Dell
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:04.580]   And get their version you've got to get it make it for everybody sure that's why they still sell the 15 inch but
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:07.540]   You know the the old one
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:10.420]   The 2015 15 inch will see it works great
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:15.620]   I know I love my I love it. I use it every day. So when I took to Japan
[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:20.420]   I was gonna take a windows machine and I finally at the last moment I said I can't do it. I can't do it
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:23.300]   Can't do windows man. I can't
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:30.340]   All right, uh, we are going to uh fold this operation up and put it in a box for next week
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:35.860]   It's a box show like a box lunch. Yeah, yeah like a bento box
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:39.700]   No, it's more like charlie mccarthy. We're gonna just fold you guys up put them in a box
