[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.920]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.000]   This is Twitter.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.840]   Bandwidth for MacBrigley is provided by cashfly at CACHEFLY.com.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:42.400]   Now, you know what we could do is we could keep going
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.200]   and answer some questions and so forth.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.760]   I'd be glad to do that.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.040]   This is part of the after show.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.640]   Yeah, we can.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.960]   Oh, now we start the after show.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.120]   This is the best part of the--
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.480]   It's a little bit blue.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.200]   Well, we had to keep it under CD length.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.680]   So this horse thing.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.720]   How many have you heard the profane version?
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.480]   I would like to clear the air about this.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.360]   Of course you were.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.200]   That's the idea.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.920]   So Catherine the Great walks into a bar.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.920]   No, stop it.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.320]   And she says, why the long face?
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.560]   That's not even funny.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.240]   Oh, I get it.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.400]   Why the long face?
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.760]   Because you see, I took it and I brought the horse part.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.960]   Now playing for Scott Born number 23, Craig Severson, the pod
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.320]   grunt.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.760]   Come on in here, Craig.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.600]   Are we going to do back break after dark?
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.880]   Let's do back break after dark.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.840]   Where's my bathrobe?
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.640]   Little ladies.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.280]   It's Merlin Heff.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.920]   So where's the audience question, Mike?
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.520]   Oh, we got to mine.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.600]   Put that out there.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.480]   OK.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.880]   And we can continue to record, although if you want to take it
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.160]   and mix down of the headphone and--
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   We can just keep on recording.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.920]   It's just going to be real.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.440]   All right, and we'll just snip it.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.560]   Well, I usually just let it roll.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.480]   Yeah, but it's too long.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.080]   It's already an hour and 15 minutes.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.960]   Craig, he seems uncomfortable with your body.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.480]   I really am.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.360]   Really respect that.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.400]   He looks like one of those beat nicks from the '50s.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.960]   You know, he's going to do a little jazz improvisation.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.120]   So what was that you said?
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.400]   Staedrum, bucket, loving woman, continue to punch you.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.520]   Well, I think the main shush should be done.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.720]   It's already '70.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.160]   It's already '70.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.800]   But now we keep recording.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.000]   I said, another one.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.320]   Oh, well, they just keep recording.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.440]   See, this is Alex's new plan.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.040]   Alex's new plan is we record for like 11 hours.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.400]   I know.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.240]   I don't like that plan.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.040]   It's too long.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.720]   You know, now I said I was going to shorten it.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.480]   We got all these comments on the twits.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.640]   I'll be willing to be longer.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.400]   They say that.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   You get a bunch of people who belong to the site.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.280]   Hey, when people want to keep on the way more,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.600]   we want them to come back saying, oh, I want to hear more.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   Not say, boy, I really got enough Mac break.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.800]   For the love of God.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.640]   For the love of God's.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.120]   These guys have a power button and a volume button.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.520]   Bring it way down.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.040]   Way down.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.320]   So questions, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.600]   Just step up to the microphone.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.240]   Anybody who's over there can ask a question.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.960]   Make a comment.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.600]   Make a suggestion.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.520]   Go ahead.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.200]   Step right up there.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.240]   Ask a question.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.760]   Hi.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.960]   Hi.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.720]   Got your name?
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.280]   Phil.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.800]   Hey, Phil.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.720]   Hi, Phil.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.680]   Hi, Phil.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.640]   I was just listening to Mr. Polk talk.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.160]   And I work at a national laboratory east of here.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.080]   And it just occurred to me that we should subcontract Apple
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.200]   for our own secrecy.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.760]   No kidding.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.840]   This is unbelievable how this whole phone got developed.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.600]   And people were so off the mark.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.000]   It just blew my mind.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.240]   Did you just tell me you work at Lawrence Livermore?
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.760]   Well, in control.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   Is that what you just told me?
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.560]   No.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.480]   I'll turn my badge around.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   And your clearance up.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.640]   Bring it to me.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.480]   I'm disavowed to acknowledge any clearance
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.840]   that I may or may not have.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.080]   But let's just put it this way.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.280]   The government could learn a few things from Apple.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.680]   Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.560]   I work in a very high security area.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.240]   So to keep that kind of secrecy is pretty amazing.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.160]   And for that, like the time and with the press continually--
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.520]   That huge amount is scrutiny.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.960]   And everybody going from 11 different angles,
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.680]   everybody knowing and guessing everything that's going to happen.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.960]   And you still don't--
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.600]   I bet you that Apple knows where it's been modernized.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.100]   Exactly.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.000]   They know Penitentia, but it wasn't cell network.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.920]   The way they distribute it.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.640]   I bet they're not the only ones.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.200]   Just saying.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.000]   OK, Penitentia.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.200]   Just wanted to see what you guys thought.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.280]   Rumor has it that Steve Jobs may be taking a sabbatical leave
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.480]   of absence.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.520]   What do you think of that?
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.480]   What do you think might happen to Apple?
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.560]   I haven't heard that before.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.880]   Have you guys heard that?
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.760]   Part of the buzz today was that Steve was one of the reasons
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.520]   people said-- and I realize I'm a total lamer for having
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.800]   read all these rumor sites.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.200]   One of the big rumors was that one reason Steve had invited
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   so many of his friends and family to attend today
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.760]   was that he was going to make some kind of an announcement
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.560]   about his future with Apple.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.560]   But he didn't.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   But--
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.400]   He's not going to do it now.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.040]   John has to tell you that.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.440]   John Foster, what do you think?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   So traditionally with an Apple employee, every five years,
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.960]   they got to take six weeks of sabbatical as paid sabbatical.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.760]   So Steve has been with the company for since '99, 2000.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.040]   So he's over--
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.560]   He's over there.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.760]   --of sabbatical for a couple of years.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.520]   Maybe he's just going to take a sabbatical at six weeks.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.320]   So he'll lose his sabbatical if he doesn't go.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.000]   And he probably hasn't taken a vacation in a while.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.800]   So I think he's going to get in the chat and go around the world
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.720]   and see Bali and see Australia and see--
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.960]   We can lose him for six weeks.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.360]   No longer.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.000]   Isn't done.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.840]   No longer.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.400]   One way that he could make sure that all of his vacation time
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.120]   gets counted is to change the date when he said he started there.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.760]   Hey, let's get Steve Steklow over here.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   Say it out loud.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.400]   As long as we're talking about the options scandal,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.520]   Steve Steklow is a feature writer for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.760]   And it's been following this option.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.040]   Scandal's actually been covering the options scandal.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.080]   What do you think, Steve?
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.880]   Is it over for Apple or has it just begun in terms of that scandal?
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.640]   I think that would be a better question for the Justice Department.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.520]   It's up to them now.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.880]   They're continuing the investigation.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.760]   The Apple internal investigation is concluded.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.440]   But now the feds get into it.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.240]   No speculation on your part?
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.840]   He's too good a reporter to speculate.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.040]   Go ahead.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.840]   Say no comment.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.360]   Go ahead.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.440]   I've got him at the temple at the garden party.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.680]   What is the risk?
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   Let's say worst case scenario.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.960]   Could he go to jail?
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   I jail?
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   I guess the worst case scenario is fraud.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   It's unclear.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:27.040]   I mean they have admitted now for the first time that he recommended certain dates to
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.880]   be picked for stock options.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.280]   They haven't just--
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.880]   You know, this so-called clearing of Steve Jobs is not very impressive.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.120]   I mean, first it says, yeah, he recommended some favorable choices.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.760]   And then actually now he's recommending dates.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.560]   It sounds like his fingerprints are all over it.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.760]   Well, there's two defenses on Apple's bar, one that he didn't financially benefit, which
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   I think there's people who question that.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.800]   Did he not get some back-dated options?
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.240]   He did get back-dated options.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   They confirmed that.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.760]   Did he exercise?
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.280]   They were approved at a board meeting and never took place.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.800]   They fabricated documents to show the board meeting took place.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   Wow.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   Secondly, they maintained that he was not aware of the accounting implications.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.320]   That, again, it's really going to be up to prosecutors on the side.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.920]   But they did conduct an extensive investigation.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.120]   The law firm that did it is reputable.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.400]   And other firms that have had the same kind of issue.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.160]   It's also the Pixar matter.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.400]   Well, what's that all about?
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   That's also on your industry.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   Tell us about that.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.240]   Was there back-dating there as well?
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.080]   Let's just say that, again, four of the five years there were Pixar officers who received
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.880]   stock grants on the lowest price of the year.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   Oh, geez.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   The jobs, I should say, the one with the loan, the majority of the company is not one of them.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.960]   But he was the SCU.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.560]   Steve was along with us on the last Macmania cruise.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.880]   It's great to see you.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.680]   He is a great writer for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.960]   I have to say, I renewed my subscription thanks to you.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.160]   It's good to see you, Steve.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.760]   Any other questions?
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.960]   Questions from the audience?
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   Hi, John.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   Hi, John.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.960]   Hi, John.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.760]   From a wheel mill.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.400]   Oh, nice to meet you, Sumo.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.200]   Will there be like the UI phone?
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.040]   Will it make integration with the iBot, iTV, or like Swingbox?
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.400]   Well, here's an interesting thing.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.120]   It all uses iTunes as its core.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:40.160]   It's like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of music and a little bit of
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.160]   music.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.720]   Here's, I'm going to guess, but I think what you would have to do is use the media on your
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.840]   media server as your iTunes library, right?
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   Point iTunes to it, and then all of a sudden it becomes your iTunes library.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.080]   And at that point, absolutely.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.560]   Anything that's on that media server, you could stream to the iTunes.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.960]   Well, maybe I haven't talked about it.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.160]   One of my recent obsessions, I talked about this with John, is how we all deal with this
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.120]   kind of growing need for large amounts of backup and network storage.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.080]   So to me, one interesting thing is, I mean, the thing in my house, my wife and I would
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.880]   love to have is a shared, easy shared, automated backup with automated iTunes sharing.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.520]   So it's kind of interesting to think about how this figures with sharing an iTunes library
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.520]   amongst our people.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.440]   Something I can notice, like, there's Doc Mac, that if you're somehow integrated, it's
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.880]   like some big gigabyte of terabyte.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.880]   It seems like it's a software source.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.880]   Right.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.080]   It's just, where we go, I mean, right, I know how it passes and it's not where I'm
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.080]   at.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.080]   It's not a great thing because I was always in a great state.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:53.080]   Content providers, like, Hollywood's just went, but D.O. and all over your media.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   And so it's like, we like our consumers, what this, a lot this stuff.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.800]   Well, I mean, that's also the story of CES this week, is that it's all of these home
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   media servers and ways of getting this stuff around.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.360]   Apple's going to face a lot of competition for the Apple TV.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.520]   It's not the only one of our great series of time machine will help.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.520]   So what's that?
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   Time machine and a big raid.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   It solves a lot of problems.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.520]   And the storage is getting cheaper and as people are gathering one more media.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   That's the big issue.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.000]   But the issue is it's not, we don't want to just use the network attached storage as backup.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.600]   We want to use it as a media server.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   Okay.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600]   You want to talk about streaming.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.320]   Yeah, streaming or just have it be a hard drive?
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.880]   How do we do that?
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.880]   So if you have a squeeze box, it's known by Logitech.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   This is the slim P3.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.880]   The IP3 player.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880]   Right.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.040]   Basically you can control from any web browser.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:53.240]   So because the iPhone has a web browser in it, Safari, 192.168.1.0, he's 77.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:11:01.400]   And then because it's based on Apache, there can be a patch to this so that it goes, says,
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   "Oh, you're an iPhone.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.720]   I'm going to give you this interface."
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.960]   And now I've got the squeeze box interface for my iPhone, the 320-240 thing.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.940]   And I can go next, next, next, list, list, list, playlist, that thing.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.800]   Or lose the iPhone as a remote for your Apple TV.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.080]   For my MP3, that's on the network anyway.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.080]   Right.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.120]   I think this is the geek, that thin layer of geekdom that we're going to have a hell
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   of a lot of fun with.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:37.720]   But see, this is the thing that's unsaid today, is that because it's running Safari, because
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.560]   it says, and when it announces itself, it says, "I'm Safari, I'm running on a PowerPC
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.120]   Mac or I'm running on an Intel Mac."
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.160]   Well, this thing is going to say, "I'm Safari, I'm running on an iPhone."
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.760]   Now Apache can kick back that interface specific because we can go look into that.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.960]   No, because of the independence.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.160]   And so now I can have the internet.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:06.840]   So for the very first time, I've got, as an application developer, I can implement something
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.160]   on an iPhone, excuse me, on an iPod, which has been a closed, closed, closed, no way
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.560]   in hell are you ever going to have anything to your own application.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.560]   Very interesting.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.320]   And so it's open to me to go do this.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:25.360]   And all I have to do is a couple of Apache hacks, a couple of HT-axis things, and I've
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.160]   got my application on an iPhone.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   Does it have to be a Java enabled?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   Well, it would have to be if it's got Safari.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.160]   Well, it's Safari.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   Sorry, Safari.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.280]   It's khml, which means it has JavaScript, which means it's WebKit, which means it's
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.280]   Flash.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   Flash.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.560]   It's running some form of Flash, which it has to.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   Right.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.000]   If it doesn't run Flash, then it's not anything that we can use.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.200]   So it's just the coolest little, tiniest iMac that's ever been made.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   Right?
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.160]   The cool thing about the interesting thing is, I don't mean to hijack this thing, but check
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.160]   this out.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.640]   3.20x240 is the screen size.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:10.880]   But how cool it would have been if it would have been 512x342, the same size as a Mac 128
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.880]   when that came.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.880]   Then we could run Mac right.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   Right, yes.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.880]   But right now.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.880]   Right now.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.880]   I want it right now.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.160]   But the thing that is is that, so we looked back 27 years ago with a Mac 128.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:28.840]   Here's the thing that's this big, essentially, and we can put applications on it.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   It will definitely transform.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.280]   I think one of the big questions about the iPhone is how far we're going to be able
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.280]   to develop for it.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.640]   Well, but I think what John is saying is interesting because it has Safari, it does
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.640]   open a door to this.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.640]   Right.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.640]   And because--
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.640]   At least to Web applications.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.640]   So here's the other thing.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.440]   I went and looked through developer.apple.com today.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:53.160]   Not a single shred of evidence that me as a developer will be able to make an application
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   for the iPhone.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   Which I think is nuts.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   I think--
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   Well, we don't know.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   WWC is coming up.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   They might have announced something.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   Yeah, sure.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.520]   The other thing is that we were going to-- this would be my pick of the week.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520]   We didn't do it.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.520]   We were doing pick of the weeks.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.160]   John always keeps us on.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:14.800]   So pick of the week is that dashboard developer tool got released as a beta.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.440]   So this is important because dashboard development tool has basically been up to me to go and
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:27.840]   do my own JavaScript, my own debugging, and my own all this pain to make a dashboard.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.440]   Well, this toolkit has predefined things for doing stuff like countdown timers.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.520]   Like we could whip that out in like two minutes.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.040]   I don't think you could do as fast as Shane did it there.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.280]   But the idea is here's this thing.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.520]   And so with a flip of just a checkbox.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.400]   Now you're making a dashboard for an iPhone and you're making a dashboard for your Mac.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400]   It's pretty cool.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.040]   Another question from the floor.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   Is that Dan?
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   Yes.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.600]   Dan for another Leo Villian.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   Dan that runs the Monterey to Chat room for the KFI radio show.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   I've never met Dan.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.600]   We've worked together for years.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   It's nice to meet you, Dan.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:09.520]   I guess I was wondering your illustrious panel's opinions on why Leopard was downplayed
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.040]   so much at the show and what Apple's got in store for it.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.040]   You know why.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.960]   They're keeping their powder dry.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.400]   They're saying, "You know what, Bill?
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   Roll it out.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400]   Let's see what you got.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   Show me what, show me your version."
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.600]   Well, we know what VISTAs, VISTAs isn't going to change.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.600]   VISTAs done.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.200]   I mean, they could have released it now.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   But I think so.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   I think the reports from everybody out here.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   You know the problem is, Leopard's not done.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   That's the problem.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   Here's the thing.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   Derek, Derek, go ahead.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   Keep talking Merlin and then we'll get Derek.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   All right.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.840]   Yeah, they didn't release it for two reasons.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.400]   One, because they didn't need to.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.000]   Today they have plenty of other stuff to talk about.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.760]   Second, it's not ready yet.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.760]   There's a lot of work.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.760]   That's pretty clear.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.440]   There's a lot of work to be done yet.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.120]   It's going to be a terrific OS, but it's not ready yet.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.040]   They don't need to have it ready right now.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.520]   There's some plenty of other stuff going on.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.520]   Let me introduce this.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.520]   That's Derek's story.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.520]   Great photographer.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.880]   One of the great teachers of the photography Photoshop.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.080]   You do the Aperture class with Scott Bourne.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   Was it a great class?
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   Did you take that correct?
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   Pretty amazing.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.800]   Very good things about that class.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:17.040]   So thing two about this non-release of leopard and non-release of iLife, was that Steve Jobs
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.960]   himself said, "We don't have to make an event like Macworld anymore to make stuff.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.920]   We can release stuff all year long."
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   And they're gonna.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.920]   And they're gonna.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.120]   And the thing is, who cares if iLife didn't come out today?
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.120]   Because you know what?
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.880]   It's gonna come out in a three weeks or a month and it's a big buzz.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.880]   I think there's no.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.880]   We have fun stuff to go.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.880]   We're very happy, aren't we Alex Lindsey?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.880]   Because that keeps us alive for Mac break.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.880]   Yeah, we're gonna be.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.880]   We're gonna be.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.880]   We're gonna be back to a continue a lot.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   We had an open thread today on 43 Folners and the one Karma Suck thing that came up again
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.880]   and again for people was, "Okay, I thought this was Macworld."
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.880]   There's a lot of people who are kind of like the consumer.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.880]   Not iPhone world.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   Exactly.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.880]   And all of us have given up on that a lot.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.880]   I don't know.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   I gave up on that a couple years ago.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.560]   So you're the developer conference becomes the place where the Macworld has been a consumer
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.880]   event for the last few years.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.880]   If you're a pro user, you go, if you're a pro video user, you wait for an A/B or a CD.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   If you're a.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   I think Macworld has become the place to go for your hand-knit iPod cozy.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.880]   Because in the times that I've been coming to Macworld over the last, did you guys experience
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.880]   this?
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   But when I.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   Wasn't as bad today as it has been.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.680]   Last year and the year before that was like unbelievable.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   I think there are far fewer iPod accessories or maybe there are far more other things on
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.680]   the floor today.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   Leo, Leo and I spent a little bit of time today in an area that we.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.680]   Do we want to talk about that on this show?
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   No, we won't.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680]   We spent some time in what we call Tiny Town.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.680]   Tiny Town.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.680]   We like it.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   Where the world is little booze.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   A little bit of a favorite part.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   And increasingly the people you're seeing in Macworld are not the folks who are coming
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   out there with these vertical apps.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.680]   You're seeing people coming out there with a new thing to put your iPod in.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.680]   So it has become this kind of consumer super world.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   We did see some keynote things today.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   I must say, being a keynote guy.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   keynote the app.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   So, yeah, yeah.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   Somebody said this is a new version of keynote.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.680]   All right.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.680]   Craig Severson does stuff with keynote that only the gods and Steve Jobs' assistant can
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   do.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.680]   I don't actually don't think Steve Jobs' assistant can do it.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   Craig does.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   Craig's amazing.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   So you know better than anybody what you know, can't I can't do.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   What was new that Steve was using in his presentation?
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.680]   Well, some of the cheesy transitions that you never want to use in video like the exploding
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.680]   letters.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.680]   Yeah, he did a lot of that.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   That was new.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   And there was some motion movements that weren't keynote-y-ing, but I was in the back of the
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   room next to the producers doing all the stuff because I'm a video guy.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.680]   So I sort of gravitated that naturally.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   Right.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.680]   So I was looking over and seeing the preview screen.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.680]   So I knew he was on keynote because I saw it running in the back room.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.680]   Smart.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.680]   So anyway, some keynote stuff was--
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   So that's keynote three that he was playing with, probably.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   That's my panel.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   And of course the truth is he was always a beta user keynote.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   I mean he was using keynote before keynote existed.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   So that's nothing new for Steve.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   Doesn't mean that there's a new keynote ready to go.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   I think it'll be in spring.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   I talked with the keynote people today on the floor and they were saying spring.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.680]   Spring.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   So that's an eye work.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   And they're on our fire.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   And they're out--
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   I said they wouldn't necessarily have to be--
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.680]   Their offices have been relocated to the San Francisco Bay.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.680]   And by the way, I'm going to play with the iPhone on Monday.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.680]   So whatever nicest to me maybe can come with you.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.680]   How are you going to do that?
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.680]   I have friends at Apple.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   If you ever wanted to have Scott Boren's service to you in some kind of a personal way, I think
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.680]   this is your opportunity to leverage that.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.680]   I think I might.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.680]   Can we send a camera with Craig to do that?
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.680]   Probably not.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   They probably won't let you.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   Shoot.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.680]   You had to ask.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.680]   Shubey!
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   Ask a question, Shubey, dooby.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.680]   I don't think anybody's pointed out that Apple knocked out like five different rumors in one device.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   Yes.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.680]   Yes.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   It's a first, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.680]   They were their own rumor aggregator.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   When we're talking about this, there was the rumors like, "Oh, there's going to be some kind of an Apple phone."
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   No, no, there's going to be a subcompact Apple computer device.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.680]   I do love the way Steve--
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   Oh, no, there's going to be an easy tablet device.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   It was kind of a cheat, but I love the way Steve got into this to say, "We have three new products we want to announce today."
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.680]   We have a--
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   Highscreen iPod.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.680]   A wide screen touch screen iPod.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   We have a--
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.680]   Then everybody goes, "Growr!"
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.680]   We have an iPhone.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.680]   "Growr!"
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   Of course, you should have saved that for the last because--
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   And then we have an internet communicator.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680]   Huh?
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   Look at the boy doing it.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   Huh?
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   But it was brilliant.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   It was brilliant because then he did the twist, you see.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   And it's all in one.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   So it was the arc of the plot line there.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   Oh.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   I thought it was really good.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680]   But that was only the second act.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   Do we have a third act?
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   Well, and I think that one thing that is really important of what we're looking at right now is this is version one, pre-version one.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   The phone.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   The development of the phone.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.680]   You're thinking they'll turn some of those JPEGs into applications?
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   I hope so.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   I think there's a future in that.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   I think there's a future in going from JPEG to app.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   I'm just saying that in terms of-- I don't know if any of you are involved with the call agile programming or extreme programming, but if you could just put out JPEGs instead of actually making them out.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   That's all you need to really do.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   Absolutely.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   Your team is going to work.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   I'm going to sell--
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.680]   Very lightweight way to operate.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.680]   You don't have to do any kind of quote unquote bug testing.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   There's no regression testing.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.680]   You just got to push out a JPEG.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.680]   And if that works, you release it.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   Release often.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.680]   Release your JPEGs often.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   Justine saying, please replace the eye check JPEG with an actual eye chat interface so she can talk to her.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   Justine is-- you are a text messaging user.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   Yes.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   She hasn't stopped the whole show.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   I'm trying so hard.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   No, it's cute.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.680]   Justine, are you a grazer?
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   Do you graze?
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   Where goes the game?
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   I'm going to raise.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.680]   Just read the message.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.680]   What does it say?
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   It's actually Twitter.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.680]   I'm a part of that.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   Oh, no.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   You're on the Twitter.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680]   I've been getting all the mackerel updates.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   Oh, that's not the same.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   Well, no.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   But I mean, it's still text messages.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.680]   Twitter is like the away message, the Web 2.0 version of the away messages.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.680]   Yeah, there's actually--
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   What is Twitter besides stealing our copyright?
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.680]   Twitter.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   Oh, my God.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   Besides a little trademark infringement.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.680]   You would have shit, wrestle shirtless.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.680]   I would love to see that.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.840]   Twitter is a service that lets you basically do what you would normally do within a away
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.840]   message in AIM.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.680]   Now, as a way of saying so, you can very quickly update to a webpage or to a device.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   And luckily--
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   So who's sending you these Twitter things?
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.680]   Twitter makes it easy for you to--
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   It's all this personality spam, everybody in your life.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   I don't get it.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   Yeah, well, it's actually all the random people that are mackerel right now updating.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.680]   So somebody just types mackerel and then whatever they want to say.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   And I'll get the update.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   So you're basically getting a bunch of random messages from strangers.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.680]   Random because I don't know.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.680]   But there's actually this other website.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.680]   It's called "River" that's still in beta right now.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   But you check into locations.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.680]   So I've been checking in at Macworld.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   I checked in that I'm here right now.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.680]   So with dodgeball or--
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.680]   Yeah, kind of.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   But it's a little bit different because they're also going to be syncing this for GPS.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.680]   So if I had you-- if I had Justine on my phone, it would say, "Oh, Justine's at the 21st
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.680]   Amendment right now."
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.680]   Yes, and it's really-- it's kind of creepy, actually.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   Have you done places?
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.680]   In "River"?
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.680]   PLA ZE's S--
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.680]   Oh, no, I haven't seen that.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.680]   No.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.680]   Oh, no.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.680]   It's totally creepy.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.680]   These are all stalker apps.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.680]   Yes.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   It's completely an affordance for letting people stalk you.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   Yes.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   Justine can't see one and say, "Watch me from afar.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.680]   Here's where I'm sitting right now."
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   Oh, that's really weird.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.680]   It's like creepy wear.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.680]   Oh, I know.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   Would you like to come to ziz with me?
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   Great.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.680]   And all of that's through text messages.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.680]   So I was thinking you were in a deep conversation with somebody that's completely random message.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   It's a sad world, people are.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.680]   Somebody who lives in SMS, so I'm-- as you know, I'm 65.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   I'm very--
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.680]   You look great.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   It looks great.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   I've got lots of problems.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   You know what I try to work out.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.680]   I get up every day, I do a sit-up, and then I have a lot of coffee.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.680]   But somebody who's very comfortable in the world of SMS, and the kids today apparently love
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   the message.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.680]   Kids love it, the kids.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.680]   And you don't mind the constant interruptions that drag your brain down into some kind of
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680]   dull, rounded point.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   But if you're comfortable with that, how do you think you're going to deal with the iPhone?
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.680]   Are you going to be comfortable with that as--
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.680]   No.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   --when it pings you?
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   I like that little Xyla concept.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.680]   Oh, I'm not sure.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.680]   I mean, I'm just concerned about the typing, because I like to be able to drive in text,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   but you know--
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   Oh, no.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   You don't do that, do you?
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   No, let's talk.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   Let's talk, because I do that too.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.680]   So do you put it in the steering wheel like this, and then hold the wheel like this and
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   type?
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   I don't know.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   It's just more.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.680]   I'm like trying to do one of these.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   You do it like this, right?
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   Yeah, it's rough.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.680]   It's rough.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   Okay.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.680]   Not too much.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   Oh, I just got to text you to Amber McArthur.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   Amber McArthur.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   What?
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   Yes, question from the floor.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   Yes, sir.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.680]   You're there.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   So the--
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.680]   From Alberta, Canada.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   Hi, sir.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   Hi, how are you doing?
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   Just had a couple of questions.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   One is about the area of syncing with the iPhone that was demonstrated.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   There's a lot of going from the computer down to the phone, but the value of going up from
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   the phone to the computer, whether or not they didn't demonstrate that, and I thought that
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   was kind of interesting thing.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   They skipped over.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   The second thing was just in the area of iTunes content in Canada, it's like it's really
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.680]   limited still.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.680]   There's no need to you guys.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.680]   You guys are always getting-- you know, we're practically the same country, and you guys
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   were always getting short shots.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.680]   And you won't get the iPhone.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   I posted it.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.680]   I posted it 43 hours a couple weeks ago.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.680]   I was like, hey, check it out.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   It's this really cool whiteboard.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   Every person from Canada who went to the site got this-- your IP address is out of the range.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   Oh.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.680]   And they weren't even allowed to view the site.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.680]   That's sad.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   You guys, how do you handle that?
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   They're so nice.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   Is that--
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   We just get cold and bitter.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   So you said you thought you might be able to use the iPhone?
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.680]   Well, one of the guys in the back room was mentioning that Rogers, which is one of our big cellular
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.680]   providers, is partnered with AT&T and Zingular already.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   Maybe.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.680]   That might open up the door.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680]   I hope so.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   So your question is about sinking?
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.680]   My question is about sinking in a boat.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   If you have any insight on--
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.680]   Okay, so I have a lot of insight about sinking.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   He's going to sink his trio into a glass of beer is what he's going to sink.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   Not you, too, Justine.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   Everybody with a trio sink into a glass of beer.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.680]   John's putting his trio into a beer to prove a point.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.680]   You know, and I think--
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.680]   He never has a second trio at home.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   He's not my trio.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   That's the best part.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   Well, here's the thing that I think is interesting about this is that there were-- like most of us, you know,
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   when my phone dies or when I get ready to get another phone, I just get another phone.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680]   The old phone just kind of dies.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.680]   You know, I just stick it in a drawer, I throw it away, or I do whatever, I'm going to give it away to someone or whatever.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   And you don't really think much of it.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   It's not an event.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.680]   And I have never had a day where so many people talked about throwing their phone along distance.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   It could be way better.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   People just wait.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   They have this hate relationship with their phone.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   This is what I said to somebody today.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   It's like you came out of the Matrix today.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   For the last for me, since about 1999, I've been on a series of AC phones.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   Each one just slightly less--
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   What's that?
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   Adjective again?
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   AC?
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   AC?
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   AC?
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.680]   It's an angle-- an angle of words.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   You took the blue pill.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   And I think as one today-- again, I came back to this conversation I had with my wife where she said,
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   "I don't understand why all of you nerds are so excited about the possibility of a cell phone."
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   And I said, "You know what? This is something that we've all got to use.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   Some of us have actually replaced our home service with this phone.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   We're using this to get our email.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   So we're using this to connect to the web.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.680]   Nobody I know likes this phone.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   Well, and I talked about my trio.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.680]   I mean, I have a trio.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   A trio of 650 and a lot of us do here.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   We were all wandering around with our trio.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   And we were talking to our friend.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   Both of us agreed that we hate our trio with a passion.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.680]   We just hate every other phone more.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.680]   I agree with you.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.680]   And that's the thing.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.680]   The problem with every one of these phones, I've said it's all along with the sprint.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.680]   It's like when you're using your phone, you're not using a unified device that's there to make your life better.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   You're experiencing a series of business development relationships.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.680]   Where you move into different outcomes, you move in and out of outcomes of functionality.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.680]   And in no way are they connected to each other.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   So on sprint I have to go, "Okay, sprint. I'm ready to listen to that Pixie song now."
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   And I go into the area where I listen to the Pixie song.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   I can't go surf the web while I'm listening to that.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.680]   God forbid I want to go look at Google Maps while that's happening.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.680]   And that was frankly my fear with an iPhone is that it's sucked into that more ass of relationships.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   It means a multi-finder.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.680]   What we used to call it just, you know, have it multi-finder.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.680]   It's so charming.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   You remember a multi-finder?
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.680]   I was excited.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.680]   So what is that?
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   That was system five?
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   No, no, no.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   Multi-finder.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.680]   What was that Andy Hertzfeld?
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   Oh no, that was a switcher.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   Remember that?
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.680]   Oh, switcher was sweet.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   Switcher was light switch before light switch.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   Okay.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   We have another question.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   Good time.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.680]   Is there another question?
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   Another question.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   Speak into the microphone.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   I'll speak right in here.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   What's your name?
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   Adrian.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   Hello, Adrian.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.680]   Hello, Adrian.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.680]   Hey, so I know there was some issue with the name iPhone.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.680]   Has anyone heard anything about that?
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   How they got around it?
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   Or if it's still legal?
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   We talked about it at the beginning of the show.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   It's called money.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   It's called money.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   Yeah, apparently Apple has the trademarks around the world.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.680]   Cisco and Linksys have the trademark in the US only.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   So they negotiated that.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   And I don't know if that means that Cisco will stop using iPhone for it.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.680]   It makes a Skype phone.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   It sounds like they might have decided that they'll let each other play on each other's
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.680]   ground.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.680]   Yeah, I mean, there's not really any confusion.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   You're not going to go into the store and buy the Skype phone.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   I think the bottom line is that no one's going to buy these.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   Remember Apple Core made a deal with a young company that they never imagined whatever
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.680]   get into music.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   Right.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   Yes, that's right.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   That's right.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.680]   Those three lawsuits later, the Beatles are finally on iTunes.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.680]   Did you love it?
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   I mean, the subtle way that Jobs...
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   Is it like a two-thon?
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680]   It is.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   The subtle thing that Jobs did, he done only played a Beatles song, he played a Dylan song.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.680]   It was very clever.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.680]   Just kind of saying, "Hey, by the way, here we are."
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.680]   Get five little help for my friends.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   Yes.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.680]   Okay.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   It was rumored that it might be an unlocked cell phone.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   What does that mean?
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.680]   And since I'm a T-Mobile subscriber, am I screwed?
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   Yes.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.680]   You are definitely screwed.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   Thank you for coming tonight.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   That was Kevin Rose's rumor was they were going to make both CDMA and GSM phones and
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.680]   they would be unlocked with two batteries.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.680]   A little too much dignity going on there.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.680]   I got my idea.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   I was just going to work.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   Fear.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   I'll tell you about the iPhone.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   It's going to be unlocked.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   It just means that it's not tied to any carriers, so if we're an unlocked phone, it would have
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   been great if we're an unlocked GSM phone.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.680]   But what you would lose out on, I think this is very clever, singular.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.680]   I'm sure they insist on it, is whatever integration the carrier gave you.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.680]   And in this case, singular gives you the voicemail integration.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.680]   And then I think...
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680]   Which makes it...
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   Right.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.680]   And I think that there's an important part of this.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:31:02.680]   I guarantee that Apple really developed a partnership with singular that allows them to fully take advantage of what's possible on the phone.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   A lot of the problems that we have.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   You're right.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   Motorola will build features into a phone that Verizon will not assemble.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   Oh, and then if it listens on Sprint, you get like a third of what's available.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.680]   Right.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.680]   That's very, very common.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   So everyone's hacking the phones to get what's already built into the phone.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:25.680]   It's like it's basically like buying a house in some kind of deed restricted community with like, yeah, there's five bedrooms.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   Really just the city used two of them.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   Right.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.680]   Exactly.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.680]   And so I think that I'm sure that Apple made the relationship with singular is we're going to work with you.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   If you play nicely and you let us do whatever we want to improve the experience, we'll just keep on working with you.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.680]   It's telling us.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.680]   Like you go in and you're like, you know what?
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.680]   Ohh.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.680]   We're going to take care of you.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.680]   Jobs for great and powerful jobs.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.680]   Get the questions.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.680]   Hey.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.680]   Hey.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.680]   What's your name?
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.680]   I'm Tyler.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   Hi, Tyler.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:32:01.680]   Hey, so I didn't go to the keynote, but from what I got from MacRumors was that Google and Apple were kind of merging the not merging, so they're kind of working together.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   And jobs had man boots.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   They probably didn't say that on MacRumors.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.680]   You had to be there.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.680]   But, uh, you know, they're using Yahoo mail and seem, y'all need to search.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   No, it's no mergers.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   There's no merger.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   It's a partnership.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.680]   It's a relationship.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.680]   And Eric Schmidt, who is on the stage of the CEO of Google, is on the Apple board.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   But that's been for a while.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.680]   I mean, even Eric said, you know, we don't have to merge to work together.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.680]   And that's what's new in this new economy.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.680]   We can work together.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.680]   This does bring up an interesting question, though, because a lot of folks like me love, love Gmail, love using it.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   I think it's one of the best web applications out there.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   It's not IMAP.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.680]   But it didn't have the IMAP.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.680]   And Leo, we've talked about this before.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   And for me, if you don't have IMAP, there's no deal.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.680]   Like, to me, I have had my ass kicked by pop.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   So many times, I'm never going to turn back.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.680]   Now, the question is...
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.680]   I wish I had that quote on the card.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.680]   I've had my ass kicked by pop.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.680]   And I'm...
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   So, what was the next Charles McGastian?
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.680]   Is it a cola?
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.680]   I'm not my ass.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   Let me tell you something about email.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   You've never been what I've been to.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.680]   When I was in Da Nang, when I was in a download your email.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.680]   I seen the best trial of my generation.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.680]   So, the question is, is Google, Google, who now is reportedly,
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.680]   rumoredly, going to...
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.680]   Have you heard Google's going to be upping the...
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.680]   Well, they're upping it all the time.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.680]   It's two gigs, but it keeps going up all the time.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   I actually have filled up my Gmail account.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.680]   Oh, you liar.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   You can't.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.680]   I can promise you, and if my friend who works at Google was like,
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.680]   "I didn't think that was possible."
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.680]   I'm like, "I just think..."
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.680]   Justine, how could you have more than two gigabytes of email?
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   I have no idea.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.680]   I know, I'm sorry.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   I just got some random text.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   I don't know how to speak up.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   It's pretty weird.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   They have drugs for that.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   Did you just text her...
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   Craig's.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   What is that?
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   Show me your knuckles.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   Alright.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   So, you've used up your Google mail.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.680]   I did.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.680]   Is it around three gigs now?
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.680]   What is it?
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.680]   I actually...
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.680]   How in the hell could you do that?
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   I don't know.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.680]   I'm at 97% right now, just ahead of delete some things.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.680]   Are people like...
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.680]   How much are you?
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.680]   Like, both starts, symphonies to every email?
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.680]   I don't know.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.680]   I mean, I've had it for a couple years, so I mean,
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.680]   I do have to see bigger attacks.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   She bought into that thing where you don't ever throw out emails.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   I don't know.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   It's an episode.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   You never throw out.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.680]   So, how big is Yahoo!
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   I mean, I know if you pay for it, what's the...
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   What is it?
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   Two gigs?
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.680]   I know it's at least two gigs.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.680]   Yeah, when they got all scared, they pumped it up.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   But...
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.680]   Hot, hot.
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.680]   Hot, hot.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.680]   I don't know, man.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.680]   When they said that push, I'm not that thing.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.680]   I was...
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   I think I'm gonna forward my Gmail to my Yahoo! account.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.680]   So, that I can, you know...
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.680]   Let's all move to Yahoo!
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   Let's all move to Yahoo!
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   You can expose your personal information to two incredibly huge organizations.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.680]   No, I don't.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   I give up.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.680]   Maybe you can send an attachment to Microsoft.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.680]   Information, clarity.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.680]   Okay, what's up?
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.680]   Yes, sir.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.680]   What's your question, sir?
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.680]   What's your name?
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.680]   This is Adilence.com.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.680]   A love on IGC!
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.680]   Well played, my friend.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   Right.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   My question isn't a relation to the iPhone.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.680]   Has Apple brought sexy back?
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   Yes.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.680]   Well...
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.680]   It never run away, John.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:03.680]   It never went away.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   Oh.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.680]   It's a fucking sweetie.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   Yeah, no.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.680]   There isn't a sexy...
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.680]   Maybe the razor's kind of a sexy cellphone.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.680]   You know the...
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.680]   The Dolce and Gabbana...
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.680]   Dolce and Gabbana razor is sexy, but it's high maintenance, so...
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.680]   It's telling them that's an entire business.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   So, yes!
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   Apple has brought sexy back.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   It was.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.680]   You know, the razor isn't that sexy.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.680]   It's bigger than a star tag.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.680]   I know, but it's bigger than a star tag.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.680]   So, I mean, this is like the sexiest phone that ever was.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   And you're bigger than a tick-tack, but that doesn't mean...
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.680]   It's sexy.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   Well, you know, whoever uses tick-tacks for that.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   Anyway, the answer is definitely yes.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.680]   And I'll stand by when I said 42...
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.680]   Tell us about uneasy silence.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.680]   Uneasy silence, what we're following in this morning.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.680]   Oh, we were all over your site.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   We were all over your site.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.680]   All over your site.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.680]   You can still find our tears of joy streaming down the page from this morning.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.680]   Was that the best coverage?
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   Now, actually, let's...
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.680]   Isn't that really great coverage?
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   Let's talk to you guys that were stuck in the room because you didn't get to go to the keynote.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.680]   You had to follow the web.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   So, you looked at Mac rumors.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.680]   You looked at...
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.680]   You looked at Engadget?
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.680]   We had Engadget, Mac rumors.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   We had like six tabs.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.680]   Mac were.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.680]   Uneasy silence.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.680]   I need to sign them.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   Who?
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.680]   SpiMac, who had the best coverage?
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   I think Engadget, because they had a lot of quotes.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.680]   Yeah, Engadget really liked it.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   They're very good at that.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.680]   They've done that for several years now.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.680]   Who is not like all the pictures we have?
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   Uneasy silence is the prettiest.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.680]   Yes.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   No question.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.680]   I love my headphones.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   I love my headphones.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680]   Which, you know...
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   The light, but the light comes to my eyes.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.680]   Were you doing the typing?
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.680]   Were you the guy?
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.680]   I wasn't doing the typing.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.680]   My favorite part, you don't know, actually...
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.680]   I wasn't sure who was in the keynote reporting.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.680]   Oh.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.680]   But I'm actually reporting on uneasysilence.com/macworld.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.680]   Great.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.680]   And I'm doing all the reporting from the expo for.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.680]   You will absolutely go ahead.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.680]   My favorite part, and this is the part that also my wife really enjoys, is...
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.680]   Okay, people are coming in.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.680]   They're playing a Cheryl Croce song.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.680]   Oh, I do that.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   And this is the kind of thing where my wife goes.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.680]   I just don't understand what you do for a living.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.680]   So, there's a guy who's typing.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   There's a guy in a room who's typing.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.680]   About the iPhone.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.680]   And then somebody digs the article.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   Okay, okay, test.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.680]   What was the song?
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   The last song they played before Steve Jobs came on.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.680]   Anybody?
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.680]   Anybody?
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   James Brown.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   Oh, no!
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.680]   Oh, no!
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.680]   Oh, no!
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   Oh, no!
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.680]   Oh, little tribute to the Godfather of Seoul.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   I think that's pretty nice.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   I think we're at the close.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.680]   I think that's class.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:24.680]   Totally classy.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.680]   Can we do that for James Brown?
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   Yeah!
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   Yeah!
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.680]   Oh!
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   I'm just...
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.680]   I'm glad they finally got Cheryl forward in the Brown.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.680]   I just thought that was never going to end.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   Didn't it seem like that was going to go like that?
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.680]   That was so awesome.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   I just want to warn you, we made some Gerald Ford jokes on Twit.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   And it didn't go over well.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   So, just a word around it.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   Gerald Ford of all the presidents.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.680]   He was the nicest.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   Nicest?
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   Nicest.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   He golfed.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.680]   He was the tallest, I believe.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.680]   Yeah, when he was young he had great hair.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.680]   He enjoyed playing football.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   He was a very nice guy.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.680]   He lived in Michigan.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   So, Gerald Ford, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.680]   Let's hear it for Gerald Ford.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.680]   And James Brown, together at last.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   Actually, we've got a chicken roll heaven.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   We've got Jimmy Carr.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   We've got a chicken roll heaven.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:04.680]   Without Jimmy Carter, we wouldn't be in this pub drinking beer.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.680]   So, we have to give it up to Jimmy Carter.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.680]   Wait a minute, let me think.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.680]   Why would that be?
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:15.680]   Well, because he basically changed a whole bunch of laws that allowed for beer to be brewed.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:16.680]   You know what's in it?
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.680]   Say it a minute.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   You mean there was no beer before Jimmy Carter?
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.680]   Home brewing was illegal.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.680]   Home brewing was illegal prior to 1970.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.680]   Oh, so you wouldn't have a brew pub.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.680]   You couldn't have a brew pub.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   You couldn't have a brew pub.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.680]   You could have a brew pub.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.680]   It was Schlitz or nothing.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.680]   Who Schlitz or nothing?
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.680]   What people don't know is that, and I'm sorry, I don't want to bore you guys because I know
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.440]   you enjoy the technology, but what a lot of people don't know is that in 1978 Jimmy Carter
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.680]   passed the 21st Amendment, which allowed pot.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   If I could just finish, please.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.680]   Finish your joke.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.680]   It allowed a podcasting in bars.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   We wouldn't be here without it.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.680]   Yeah, so Jimmy Carter.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   Thanks for, thanks Jimmy Carter.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.680]   Is there another question?
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.680]   He was the original podcasting.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   Anybody, nobody has a question.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   Anybody?
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.680]   Indiana Jones, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.680]   We're really thrilled to hear you're coming back on this big screen.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   Hey.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   Who is that?
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   Is this Raines Cohen?
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   I was going to say you look a little familiar.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.680]   Raines Cohen.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.680]   My God.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.680]   Raines, of course, led the Berkeley Macintosh users group for many years.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.680]   Is he making the Mac more green?
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.680]   A little better than that.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.680]   What have you been up to, Raines?
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.680]   I haven't seen you in years.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.680]   It's great to see you.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.680]   I've been going from user groups, communities of practice.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.680]   Journalism to real world communities.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.680]   Co-housing, eco-villages.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   That's exciting.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:29.680]   That's great.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.680]   Trying to help make the Mac and make everybody's expo a little greener.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   B-Mug, good job.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.680]   And B-Mug was absolutely the greatest Macintosh users group ever.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   The greatest part is we did a chapter 7 bankruptcy, got rid of the office, the staff, the debt, the newsletter, that so-called magazine.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.680]   Remember that thing?
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.680]   That was four-hundred pages.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.680]   Was that yearly?
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.680]   But the community kept going on.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:57.680]   Every Thursday night for every week now, after the meeting, even though there isn't a meeting, people still go out for dinner after the meeting.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.680]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   That's really neat.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.680]   Raines, how many Mac worlds have you been to?
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   Let's see, is this 21?
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.680]   Twenty-one.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.680]   Twenty-two.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   Twenty-two.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.680]   The 22.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   The 22.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.680]   The 22.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.680]   The Kibs County San Francisco.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   I've been all but the last Boston and all but the last New York.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   Wow, that's great.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.680]   Wow, that's great.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   That's every day of my life.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.680]   I just want to know if I can drink in Mac world now, if I've been to more than 21.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   Well home, that's faster past time.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.680]   That's really fantastic.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:31.680]   So what's really cool is, 21 years ago, I met this man at a Mac world expo.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:38.680]   I was running this little tiny soccer company and Raines came up and said, "Hey, what do you got?"
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:44.680]   And I gave him the demo and I was young and I didn't even know what I was doing.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.680]   And this man covered the stuff that I was doing.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   And you know what?
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.680]   He really, really, really helped.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.680]   When I was a Mac week.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.680]   With Mac week, yeah.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   So Magic Software, Autosave, Backmatic, Power menus, Power icons, it was all a fun time.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.680]   And I couldn't have done it without him.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   That's neat.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.680]   Alright.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   Again, the Mac community is the best community in the world.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   Hey, can you say one thing Leo?
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.680]   Can we all promise everybody in the room tonight?
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.680]   Can we promise them we're all going to be best friends forever?
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   BFF?
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   You give yourselves a hand.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   You magnificent bastards.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.680]   You deserve it.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.680]   So Raines.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.680]   Let me just have a group hug.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.680]   A lot of people are saying, and I think you're the only one with a standing to say it for sure,
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   that this was a very significant Mac world keynote.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   Maybe one of the most important Mac world keynotes, certainly in a long time.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   Would you agree?
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   Well, it's significant as a show, but I mean, look at that keynote.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   Is it really a Mac world?
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   Yeah, what is it?
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   But for Apple, this was a very important day.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.680]   It's important for Apple, but I mean, already the show has been becoming iPod world.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   Right.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   And it's, you know, it wouldn't be nice if we just had them as separate shows and on the separate halls.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   You think we should eventually have plastic things in which to put your iPod world?
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   Because I think people would show up.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   I think you would have a six-milliont ticket.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:07.680]   It's a little late.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   It's an hit again, but it's still consumer culture.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   It's just more toys, more stuff, more things to spend money on.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.680]   Oh, you're just an old hippie now.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.680]   So, Rains, Rains, if you could change one thing today, if you could say to the kids out there,
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.680]   the one thing that they could do to make a difference with the way they're using the Mac,
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   the way that they're living, what would you say to them?
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.680]   The one thing is just step back and take a look, go to, there's lots of carving calculators online,
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   understand what your impacts are for your electricity, for the stuff you, your flight to the show,
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   your drive, and all set that.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   You know, the plant trees, do more solar and wind, that'll make a difference.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   We do not want Mac world to be underwater, which is going to be happening.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.680]   Can I ask you a follow-up, Rains?
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   Is it true that recycling is BS?
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   (Laughter)
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   Panjalette says it's BS, and I want you to respond.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.680]   (Laughter)
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   That's sort of like asking, asking Mac versus Windows, and when you throw something in the trash,
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.680]   does it really go away?
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.680]   I know, yeah.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:08.680]   Panjalette has 666 stenciled into his floor of his Las Vegas home, I'm not going to trust him on anything.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.680]   (Laughter)
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:15.680]   Thank you Rains, it's really great to see you, one of the great Mac pioneers and a great guy,
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:21.680]   and obviously doing his best to change the world, living a carbon neutral life.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.680]   Check out starting tomorrow, greenmymac.org.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   Greenmymac.org, I love it.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:27.680]   Nice.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.680]   Was it Rains' group that you green the Apple store?
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.680]   Was that you guys?
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.680]   That was good.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   I got to be back to a green big big on the greenmy Apple store.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   Oh, so that big whale that they delivered and then saved, that was a different group?
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.680]   (Laughter)
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.680]   Save this whale.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:41.680]   (Cheering)
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.680]   The average is like a reddish green.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   The generator is a reddish green spotlight on the Apple.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.680]   That's not so good.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   That's E ironic.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   (Laughter)
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   All right.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   I agree.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.680]   I agree.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   I agree.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.680]   Thank you Rains Colin.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.680]   Any other questions before we wrap this thing up, it's almost 8 o'clock here.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   We just have a couple of more minutes.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   It feels like 12.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   I know, it's going along.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.680]   How many of these do I know?
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   I don't know.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   Is anyone counting?
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   Go ahead.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   You got a quick question.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   Yes sir, into the mic.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   So?
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   What's your name?
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   Mike.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.680]   I'm Mike.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.680]   For the first time since the 80's, I have a Mac.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.680]   I have an Apple.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.680]   First time since the 80's.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.680]   Hey, let me ask questions.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   How many of you guys have got an Apple?
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   Wow, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   What?
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:31.680]   According to the experts, what is the one app that I need to add to my back?
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.680]   You know what?
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   I think that's a roundtable question.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.680]   He was going to be here.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   A guy named Alcor came up to me.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   I met.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   Alcor is at the show.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.680]   He's at the show.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.680]   He's in the internet.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.680]   Was he in his chamber?
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.680]   No.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.680]   He wheeled around.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   You know what's wild?
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.680]   He's just the normal looking guy walked up to me and said, "I want to thank you for a quick silver."
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.680]   He said, "Yeah, isn't a great application."
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.680]   He said, "Yeah, I wrote it."
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.680]   And I went, "I fell to my knees."
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.680]   I said, "My God."
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.680]   I was with pretty eyes.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.680]   Right?
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.680]   That's the guy he sends out.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.680]   The real Alcor is in a hardware chamber being wheeled around.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.680]   My vote.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.680]   Kind of like in June, like when that big kind of like bus full of awkward bus guy comes out.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.680]   My vote.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.680]   And I know Merlin would agree, so he's going to have to come up with another one.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.680]   Would be quick silver.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.680]   Absolutely.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.680]   Absolutely free.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   Quick silver.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.680]   Black tree down there.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   And the other one.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   Quick silver is the only Mac application I ever say.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.680]   You have to have that on every one.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   But go ahead.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.680]   Merlin, what do you think?
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   Let me go last.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   Somebody else.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   Alright.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.680]   Alex?
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.680]   I need to hear it.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.680]   Foster's opinion.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.680]   Alex is opinion.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.680]   You know, Scrivener is a really amazing little app.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.680]   Scrivener, yes.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:35.680]   Yeah, we love the Scrivener.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.680]   Scrivener is this app.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.680]   It's hard to say, but good to use.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.680]   You know, after a couple of IPAs it's kind of hard to say.
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.680]   It's good to hear.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.680]   I'm drinking a bitter American.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.680]   Oh, the bitter American's yelling.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.680]   It's very bitter American.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.680]   It's very bitter.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.680]   It's hard to say.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.680]   It's hard to say.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.680]   Thanks to...
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.680]   Thanks to the 21st Amendment.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.680]   The 21st Amendment.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.680]   The spirit.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.680]   But Scrivener is one of these apps that if you spend a little bit of time with it, learn
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   it, understand it.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.680]   It will help you write better.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.680]   It'll help you keep your thoughts better.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.680]   It's kind of idea mapping.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.680]   Mind mapping.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.680]   Yeah, idea mapping.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.680]   Mind mapping.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.680]   That kind of thing.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.680]   And I think it's worth investing in.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.680]   Eventually it'll be a pay for app that use it now while it's free.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.680]   And even when it comes out it'll only be like 30 to 40 bucks.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.680]   Totally worth it.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.680]   Justine, do you have an application that you want to pick?
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.680]   Well actually I was thinking about a Twitter app that I use.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.680]   Okay, Twitter is all right.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.680]   Twitter it gives you all of the updates of exactly what's going on on the web.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   So that's not just a Mac.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.680]   That's anything.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.680]   Any computer.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.680]   Twitter.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.680]   What's it called?
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.680]   Is that just the name of it?
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.680]   I think it was called.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.680]   But if you go to Twitter.com, Google it.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.680]   Okay.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.680]   I'll go back to you.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.680]   And Kendra says I stole her.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.680]   Yeah, you totally stole her.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.680]   That's really the only one I can recommend.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.680]   It's amazing, isn't it?
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.680]   All right.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.680]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.680]   Kendra.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.680]   In fact, I was going to do.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.680]   I was going to do Quicksilver.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.680]   I was one of my first Mac breaks.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.680]   Like, you're before you did it.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.680]   Oh, she was.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.680]   I'll vouch for that.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.680]   And then you did it.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   So.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   You bastard.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.680]   I know.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.680]   These kinds of ideas.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.680]   They don't belong to one person.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.680]   It's what the Germans call it.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   No.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   It's like guys.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.680]   It's a time.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.680]   We share something special, Marlon.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.680]   Time goes.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.680]   If you're like, you'll touch my monkey.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   Something's very, very special.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.680]   Alex Lindsey, your must have.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.680]   Can I just say that whatever Alex picks, it's going to be over faucet.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.680]   No, no, no, no.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.680]   Alex's op is going to be.
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.680]   No, it'll be that magic screen.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.680]   It's going to be 500.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.680]   Magic 300.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   Everybody must have.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.680]   Everybody needs to be a wave match.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:28.680]   Okay.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.680]   Okay.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.680]   Okay.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.680]   So many times in this application.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   I don't know if I'm looking at it.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.680]   Two times in.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.680]   Okay.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.680]   And somebody has three images.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   It's going to set up.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.680]   And it's 700 hours.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   And it's 700 hours.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.680]   And it's got a jack shuttle.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.680]   And the jack shuttle.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:43.680]   It's not $100.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.680]   I'm like, it does most awesome key.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   Like you can pull this key on like 12 hairs.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.680]   It's not watching TV.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.680]   Like sitting on the couch.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.680]   Oh, come on.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   I don't know.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.680]   I don't see noodles that you're pulling around.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.680]   They keep pulling around.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.680]   They keep moving around.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   And like that's fun.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680]   It's $700.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.680]   Show them.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.680]   Show them they're wrong.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.680]   Alex, show them they're wrong.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:03.680]   What I was going to say.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.680]   Oh, now you talk slowly.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.680]   I didn't get it.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.680]   Get it.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.680]   So I had two applications that I was going to say.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.680]   And I said.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.680]   I made Alex cry.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.680]   That was two.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:23.680]   So one was, I couldn't really think about operating without Photoshop.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.680]   Photoshop.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.680]   Oh, wait.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   Which, which, which if you buy a new one.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.680]   Got a key lowercase S.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   No, no, no.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.680]   But the one that I use probably more than anything else.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.680]   And we do a lot of uploads.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:37.680]   We do a lot of other things.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   And the real one that I was going to say that you really have to have is you've got to have
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.680]   Panics transmit.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   Transmit.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   Transmit.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.680]   Transmit.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.680]   Transmit.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   Transmit.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.680]   Transmit.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.680]   Transmit.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.680]   Transmit.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.680]   It is, it is so pathetic.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.680]   It's all about galsets.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.680]   We are chanting the name of an FTP program.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.680]   That's all we're going to do.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.680]   No one in this room is ever getting laid.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.680]   How many people here have Transmit?
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.680]   Okay.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   Speak for yourself, Marlon.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:09.680]   I'm having a moment.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.680]   Point taken.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   Wow.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   Okay.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.680]   So transmit.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.680]   Transmit versus inner rookie.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.680]   No.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.680]   First you cyber.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   Get it.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.680]   Cyber duck.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.680]   Cyber duck.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.680]   At least it's.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.680]   Cyber duck people.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.680]   But the thing is, the cyber duck people fight the transmit people.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.680]   Shirtless.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   Go.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.680]   No, no, but here's the thing.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.680]   Oh my God.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:32.680]   Oh my God.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.680]   Talk about man titties.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.680]   Your ariola are enormous.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.680]   So the thing about it has a simple pepperoni.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.680]   Frisbee.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.680]   Frisbee.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.680]   Is it nice?
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:43.680]   Marlon, you're drawing me here again.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   Transmit is good because.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   Well, I mean, I keep on discovering other things that I can do.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.680]   You know, I mean, I finally got on my favorites.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.680]   You got him to the docksend.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.680]   Well, no, no, no, I got him to the docksend in a big way.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   I have this long string of my docksend.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.680]   But now he hates the dock gone beyond the docksend.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   Yes, but docksend is a whole.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.680]   So transmit users using docksend?
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   No, I know you're the docksend anymore.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   In transmit, when you create a favorite icon.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:10.680]   So when you create a favorite in transmit, you have the ability to say here is a directory
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.680]   path on a server somewhere.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.680]   And here is a folder somewhere in my drive.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:22.680]   And whenever I drag something from that folder onto transmit, it understands that it should
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.680]   go to that server and uploads automatically.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   Now, I don't know if you're like me in like 1995, you're trying to build web pages and
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   you're sitting there with fetch, like, uploading, uploading, uploading, drag and drop on.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.680]   fetch.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.680]   Isn't that said, whatever happened to fetch?
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.680]   Poor stuff.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.680]   The little dog still running.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.680]   I'm going to get there.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   But it's great because I have to, we have to send some stuff to cache fly, some stuff to
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.680]   Libsyn, some stuff to, and it's all these different servers.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   You create, so the hack is to create multiple bookmarks for that.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   It will totally like.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.680]   Drag them onto the drive.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.680]   Oh, I got to send this to this.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.680]   It's great.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   It's really nice.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.680]   What's transmit cost?
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.680]   It's like it's under 40.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.680]   It's 40 bucks.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.680]   It's cheap.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.680]   It's worth it.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.680]   Everybody said, I said an application.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.680]   I started.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.680]   Who didn't?
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   Craig Seavers.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.680]   I got to say I work.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   I work?
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   I work because.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.680]   I'm Kino, but you love Kino.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.680]   How about pages though?
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   That's part of my work.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.680]   You use pages?
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   Because it keeps me from having to buy a Microsoft application.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   All right.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   All right.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   Did your son show you how to use that?
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.680]   Your grandson?
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.680]   No.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.680]   Thank you.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.680]   Oh, do you see the grid?
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   No, they turned hours ago.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   I'm sorry, Merlin.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   Hey, I'll tell you what, I'll lend you a couple of brick tags.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   It'll be fun.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   You can pay me back later.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:33.680]   Anyway, we're going to wrap this up.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.680]   We've done our picks.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.680]   Oh, thank God.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   This is the longest show in history.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.680]   But what we're going to do is we're going to divide it in half.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.680]   So this is the second half.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   So we'll do the first half.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.680]   We'll put that up on the net and then we'll say for those of you who don't mind the word,
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.680]   pepperoni nipples, you can go and load the second half.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   That is so the name of this episode.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   That's the name.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.680]   Pepperoni.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.680]   If you're living in your parents' basement drinking Mountain Dew and writing your own
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:01.680]   modules for Dungeons and Dragons, this is going to be super nice.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   That's how I just want to point out that's how I learned Pascal.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   Oh, geez.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   What, maybe more like player character sheets?
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.680]   No, no, no.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.680]   I had random generated dungeons from the back of the desk.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   You don't ever want to get these guys drunk, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.680]   Well, I'll just tell you, in the back of the Dungeon Masters Guide, there was a random
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.680]   generation of monsters in my program, that entire thing you could tell.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.680]   What did this happen on Dignation?
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.680]   1984.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.680]   T I 99.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.680]   4A.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.680]   We sat there for a minute.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:57.680]   [Music]
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:06.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
