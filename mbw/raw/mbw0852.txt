[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Alex and D.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   Mr. Sneller here, we have lots to talk about.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.000]   A couple of big anniversaries.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   Keynote was announced on this day, 20 years ago.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.000]   So was Safari!
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And of course, it's the anniversary of the announcement in 2007, 16 years ago of the iPhone.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   We'll talk a little bit about the good old days and why Apple doesn't have its own expo these days.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.500]   Also, some kind of bad news from Mark Gurman.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.000]   Well, good news if you like ARV or bad news if you want to get a Mac or an iPad.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.500]   And we're going to talk about Apple leaving Broadcom and Qualcomm trying to make their own chips.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.500]   Podcasts you love.

[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500]   brought to you by ACI Learning and IT Pro.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.500]   Hello everybody.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   I'm Leo LaPorten.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500]   It's a beautiful day for baseball.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   No, it is not.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500]   Jason Stell will confirm that from sixcolors.com.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500]   Are you flooded?
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500]   I'm not, but it's definitely my lawn.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   It's very well watered.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   You have a lawn, which is impressive.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500]   It's a small one just in the back.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.500]   We ripped out our lawn in the front of the house,
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   but there's a little tiny one and it is hydroponic right now.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   Yeah, floating.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   Floating.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   It's been, we've had three weeks pretty much of nonstop rain in California,
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   which means almost the entire state is under flood watch.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   I thought I might not be able to get to work,
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   but actually they must have cleared the drains because there wasn't.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   We weren't blocked off of work.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   That's Andy Inako.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   He's getting rain too, back east.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   Actually, we've peaked into the '40s today.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   I'm wearing these short sleeves.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   Some of the time.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   Exactly.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.500]   There are a lot of people in New England who are like,
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   "Damn it.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   There's a race in New England for some people to like,
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   "No, no, it's December.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   It's only 38 degrees.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.500]   I don't need to turn on the heat for the winter yet."
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   And so it's okay for them to be everybody, like 52 degrees in the living room,
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500]   but we're not turning on the heat yet.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   And a lot of people are like, "Oh man, I turned on the heat."
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   It was only like one night of 18 degree weather.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   Why didn't I hold out?
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   You're here.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   You need an eight sleep mattress pad.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   That's what you need.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   Maybe.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.500]   Because then you don't care.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   Hot or cold.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is here.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.500]   A sleep is a sponsor.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   I shouldn't give him the free plug, but I'm thinking about it because it's really
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.500]   nice.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   I'm your cold or hot night and cold is what we got.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.500]   Alex is from 090.media.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   That's his day job.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500]   Or is it the other way around?
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   Office hours.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   It's his day job.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.500]   His day job.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   And 090 is what his day job is.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500]   I do that first thing in the morning.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   You do that before?
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   Wow, you get up that early.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   The show, our little daily show is 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   So I did it specifically because I have a day job.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   So I was like, "I can do this if I do it first thing in the morning."
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   And then I go change my shirt and go back to work.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   But office hours never sleeps because there are many, many people.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.500]   They keep it going all day.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   It's incredible.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   24/7.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.500]   The after hours and office hours and all kinds of hours.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   We've got Renee Rich.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   He's going to be joining us next week.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.500]   I'm going to be on a Monday.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   I understand that.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   He said he couldn't do Mac break weekly.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.500]   Now I'm starting to...
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   He's talking as...
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.500]   It's ad hoc.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.500]   As his official position.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   Oh, I see.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   He's talking about creation.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   Okay, he can do that.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   He's not doing that.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.500]   He had him on Twitter.
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   He can do some...
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   I think he can do shows once in a while.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   He just can't be a real...
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   Exactly.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.900]   I'm wondering if like that now that enough time has passed that he feels as though he's
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.500]   made himself indispensable to the organization that like, "No, they're not going to fire
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   me over that.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   I can do whatever I want."
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   Let's start testing them.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   Let's start testing them.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   You know that happens.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   With the electrified fence for weaknesses.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   See, example would be Matt Cutts who worked at Google and because he was employee 10 at
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   Google, he could do whatever the hell he wanted.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   But it did take him a few years to get to that stage.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   I will say that I interact with Renee a lot related to his position.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.500]   I would interact with him.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   I mean, what he's doing at YouTube is just really great.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.500]   He's exactly the right guy.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   He's just the person for that.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500]   Because he's so caring, right?
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   He is and he understands the issues.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   He certainly knows this.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500]   And he really is.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   And he really is.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   And there's just the whole team there at YouTube is very responsive.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   I'd be less caring.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.500]   I might know the information.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   But I say, Logan Paul, get the hell out of my office.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   Renee has one of those skills that is all too rare where he just has this gift for forming
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   connections with people.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   It's amazing.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.500]   And basically creating communities.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.500]   I think it's one of the reasons why he had so much success with Apple.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   I think it's why he had basically by YouTube found them and why they basically started having
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   these conversations about, hey, maybe Renee would be useful to us.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   It's not making contacts.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   It's not networking.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.500]   It's just that, hey, you're an interesting person.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.500]   Let's talk.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   I want to know about you.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   I want to know what you do.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   And so this is who he is.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   So again, as a community organizer, he's an exceptionally good person.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.500]   I hear at the Apple campus they have a nickname for the iPhone.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.500]   The gift that just keeps on giving.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   For us here at Macbreak Weekly, the iPhone is the gift that just keeps on giving.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.500]   Because twice a year we get a story about the anniversary of the iPhone.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   Oh man.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.500]   The iPhone was announced at Macworld Expo on January.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.500]   What was the day?
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   January 9th, maybe.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.500]   January 9th.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   It was around this time.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   Because this is the anniversary.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   16 years ago.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.500]   16 years ago.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   Wow.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   Time flies when you're making billions of dollars.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   On iPhones.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   Well, and I just remember the whole build up towards it.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   Oh yeah.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   You were on the show at the time at Macbreak Weekly.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.500]   Was you Merlin Mann?
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   I think Scott and I were both.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   Both of us got not very bullish.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   Like we were like non-binary.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   Scott said it's going to be the iPhone.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.500]   Remember, we didn't even know the name.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   Scott said it's going to be the iPhone.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.500]   It's going to come out at Macworld Expo.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   Steve's going to announce it.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.500]   And I'm going to get a vest.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.500]   Oh no, I think it was Merlin said you're going to get a vest made out of iPhones.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.500]   Aren't you?
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.300]   And Scott said I absolutely am.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.300]   And in fact, it was the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle the next day in June
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.100]   when the iPhone finally came out.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.500]   It was Scott Bourne coming out of the Apple Store with iPhone number one in San Francisco.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   So it was very devoted to the.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.500]   And you know what?
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   He was right.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.820]   The first iPhone, not that impressive in some ways.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.820]   In most ways.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.820]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.820]   It was a 2G phone in a 3G world.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.820]   It didn't run apps in a world where everything else ran apps.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.220]   It was incompatible with a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.860]   It didn't even have cut copy and paste for God's sake, which is again, we forget that
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.140]   we think about the after 16 years, we think about the iPhone revolution and we think about
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.460]   we imagine that before then everybody was like, had a like this basket phone.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.180]   We have to turn a crank in order to turn the generator to make a mobile call.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:21.420]   What actually in terms of basic features, they were all already there on multiple platforms.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:29.100]   And it was it is a testament to how well Apple decided to basically take a turn take a phone
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:35.820]   that's inspired by iPod with Apple design language and also powered by famously everything
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.660]   that every engineer at Apple hated about every smartphone that they'd use before then to
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.260]   how well they packaged all this together.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.980]   It took like two or three revisions before it really caught up to a Windows phone or
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.460]   to a Blackberry.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.500]   The announcement slowly migrated the later and later in the year now there in September.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.420]   The reason was in January.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.220]   Well, first of all, was because Mac world Expo still existed.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.220]   Yep.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.220]   Yep.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.220]   That was the Mac world Expo keynote.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.220]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.220]   So that was that was really.
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.460]   And every year was that way.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.020]   That was the place for Apple to address the faithful, I think.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.020]   And it was fun.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   It was a lot.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.460]   It was always what I don't know how many that auditorium holds, but thousands.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.460]   About three thousand.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.900]   Yeah, six thousand in the in the Moscone.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.660]   It went it depends on where they were doing it because a lot of that keynote oftentimes
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.420]   that sometimes it happened over next door to the at the.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.540]   Well, it was it was generally either in Moscone or Moscone West.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.380]   Your bueno was never for Mac world Expo.
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.700]   That was for separate Apple events.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.780]   It was my they were in the main Moscone and then eventually they opened the new Moscone
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.020]   West and they that was a preferred and they had WWDC there for many years.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.100]   So they they Apple really liked that venue and decided to use it for their own events
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.100]   too.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.900]   But it was always down there on Howard Street.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.220]   But when the iPad was announced some years later, yeah, smaller theater than
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.980]   the use for some people and for people who aren't familiar with those venues, we're talking
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.020]   about like Moscone, we're talking about an Expo Hall, which is all flat, no rate seats.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.060]   Your bueno, which is a conventional theater.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.740]   So it had an auditorium style seating.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.620]   So everybody could see great acoustics.
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:08.220]   So when you had the difference between like Foo Fighters at your bueno versus like Tony
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.700]   Bennett at Moscone was very, very different experience.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.260]   You were watching on TV.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.260]   Sure.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.260]   Yeah.
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:20.780]   It was a lecture hall, a swollen hotel ballroom.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.180]   It was flat.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.780]   You know, and but you know, it's funny.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.980]   There's also an anniversary of the Safari.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.340]   We'll talk about that in a bit in Don Melton says, and I was surprised to hear this very
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.900]   it was hard to get tickets to the keynotes.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.380]   I thought, Oh gosh, the whole team gets to go because there's a lot more room and when
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.340]   you have 3000 seats.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:46.260]   But still there were so many people who want to see these keynotes.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.820]   And that was really the last time when Mackerel Expo went away.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.380]   It was really the last time that the general public had a chance to go to an Apple.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.860]   Because now you either have to be a developer and win a lottery or you are a media member
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.380]   or VIP invited.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.180]   But Mackerel Expo, some percentage of those seats were reserved for the people who waited
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.260]   in line, who bought the pass and would go in and you just got to see Steve Jobs unveil
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.060]   the iPhone and that doesn't happen anymore.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.020]   And Apple didn't like Mackerel Expo for lots of reasons as a former Mackerel employee.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.860]   I think that they hated the idea that somebody else was running a whole business based on
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.020]   the star power of Apple's announcements that killed them.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.020]   Steve Jobs just absolutely despised that.
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.100]   And they hated that the date was set a year in advance and they had to have products on
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.180]   that date.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:34.740]   And it drove a lot of development at Apple, a lot of working over the holidays, a lot of
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:41.580]   frustration that they had to be ready on keynote day, whereas now Apple calls an event whenever
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.380]   they want to.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.860]   And that's a really totally different thing.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.060]   So they disliked it.
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.460]   But it was also magical in the sense that it was not speaking, like people talk about
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:56.180]   WWDC keynotes and they're like, "Oh, speaking to adoring masses, Tim Cook."
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.900]   It's like, "Well, they're not adoring masses.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.900]   They're adoring."
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.860]   But they're also paid Apple developers whose livelihood is based on developing software
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:04.860]   for Apple's platforms.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.060]   Mackerel, the expo, was different.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.500]   Those were the fans.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.900]   That was a fan audience and that has been lost.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.900]   They don't do that anymore.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.940]   It was so exciting.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.060]   So many people were there.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:21.220]   I mean, people talk now about CES, but it was kind of like CES, but it was all Apple.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:27.100]   People first, you didn't always need the beautiful Chuck Platt's Marriott and you'd come
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.940]   down and there's the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and there's the beautiful Moscone
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.180]   North.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.580]   And then of course, the Moscone West, this is where those keynotes ended up being, we
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.580]   can walk inside.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.700]   Well, I don't want to have to start at the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.700]   Never mind.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.260]   Forget I said that.
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.500]   Let's just walk inside here.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.100]   The beautiful Moscone, right there.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.860]   Well, remember this?
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.100]   Remember going in the doors here?
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.100]   Line it up.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.340]   This is where you'd line up on Howard Street.
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.340]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.260]   Years after, that was also the WWDC venue.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.580]   So definitely a place Apple was really comfortable with.
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.740]   I remember meeting you for the first time, Andy and Aco, you were going up the stairs
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.820]   right here on the escalator.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:16.260]   At Moscone West, and I saw the fedora retreating and I ran after you.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:24.260]   I chased the fedora and found Andy and Aco and I said, would you like to be on Mac Break
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.900]   Weekly?
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.260]   And the rest is history.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.260]   Absolutely.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.100]   I do remember that.
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:37.780]   The other thing that we miss out on is that this was sort of a gathering of peoples.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.220]   So that this is where a lot of that stuff sort of...
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.580]   Here I am going into looking for Andy.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.580]   There he is.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.580]   He's going up the escalators.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.580]   Just imagine the head.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.580]   Look at him.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.900]   Go, come on, Andy, come on.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.060]   And this would be jammed with Apple people.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.060]   Yep.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.100]   Apple had Google I/O there for a while.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.100]   This was really...
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.820]   I kind of missed those days.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.340]   When did that end?
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.460]   Were you still there, Jason, when Mac will explain?
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.260]   2013, I want to say maybe 2014 was the last...
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.260]   I was still there.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260]   It was the end of Mac Rolex.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.140]   But they tried to soldier on for a few years without Apple.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.140]   But really...
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.140]   I did.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.140]   They couldn't do it.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.140]   They couldn't do it.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.140]   They couldn't do it.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.140]   Andy's right though.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.140]   This was a...
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.220]   I wrote a piece about this for I'm more a while ago.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.220]   Here's the community gather.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.460]   And after Mac world Expo, honestly, WWDC became the place where community gathered.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.940]   But of course, we've kind of lost that now too.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.820]   So there isn't a place where people in the community too physically gather where even
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.060]   if you didn't go to the show at WWDC, people would still, like at Mac world Expo, kind of
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.300]   be there and there'd be parties and there'd be gatherings outside.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:46.620]   And it was really a unique kind of thing that has been lost basically because there's
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.220]   no in-person event like that anymore.
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.220]   He's going in.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.220]   Steve Jobs is waiting for us.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.220]   Steve Jobs is waiting for us.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.220]   Steve's up on three.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.220]   Steve's up there.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.220]   Oh, oh, this is the exhibit hall.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.300]   Oh, I went the wrong way.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.900]   How many times have you done that at Mac?
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.220]   Are we playing Duke Nookum?
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.740]   I already went up one flight.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.020]   This is what happens when the place is empty for a long time.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.420]   Someone can spend a lot of time mapping it out.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:16.860]   You go into Mac and there's a Mac world stage and Mac world editors are...
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:25.300]   I'm wondering if you have kind of dystopian memories of this little PTSD from the movies.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.300]   Oh, man.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.460]   Yeah, well, I mean, it was always that the cycle of it, for Apple people, I think the cycle
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.980]   was it was over the holidays.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.740]   For the press, it was always like after...
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.380]   And CES, it's still like this, which is New Year's is great, but then you're into the
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.380]   grinder immediately.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.380]   Right.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.380]   Whether it's CES or Mac world expore, both.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.420]   I mean, my poor pal Dan Moran, where was he 16 years ago?
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.420]   He was at CES.
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.460]   We sent him to CES where the iPhone was announced.
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.900]   Oh, I remember that was awful to have to make that Hobbesian choice between...
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.900]   Yeah, so it was...
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.900]   Yeah, I don't miss the days where...
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.060]   Oh, oh, I'm at South Sequoia is about to take the stage and do an automated demo here.
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.220]   Oh, this is so exciting.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.220]   These were fun.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.220]   These were really...
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.860]   This is why the neural radiance fields were invented.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.860]   They were exciting...
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.740]   Like, pho drone shots exactly like this.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.060]   By the way, the ceiling height in Moscone West's second floor room 2000, 26 feet.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.180]   Just in case you're planning to bring in a very big demo.
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.180]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.180]   And it was always...
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.180]   It was a walk through to...
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.180]   Moscone does, I guess, so you can kind of get ready for your...
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.180]   Yeah, your event.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.180]   I've had here.
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.580]   We always wanted to do these and we never had the time.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.580]   There were so many shows.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.620]   I'm sure that this was done during... with COVID money.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.140]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:50.140]   This is like what you do when you have money, but you can't do events is something that
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.140]   really gives you...
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.140]   It's really good.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.140]   It really helps you figure stuff out.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.140]   It's very good.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.940]   Accure reflection of the last couple of years of Mackerel next-level action.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.140]   That's what it looked like.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.900]   I think that's when they shot this.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.900]   They're a little...
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.900]   They're a little...
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.900]   Very few lines.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.940]   I honestly think that Apple kind of blew it.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:11.140]   There really should be still, even today, when it is a much more mass appeal product
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.380]   and many, many more people.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.580]   The core...
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:21.180]   Part core fans that you would see, there was a party, there was a band, right?
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.020]   A Mackerel Expo band.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.020]   Yep.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.700]   Well, Captain, we used...
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.660]   He's put together with Chris Brane and other people who were...
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.660]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.660]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.660]   That's secret secret.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.900]   The Mac journalists who had secret musical talents that they would...
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.380]   They would have his...
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.140]   And he would have his ukulele and play with them a little bit too.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.140]   It was such...
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.140]   It was great.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.020]   Chris Brane used to talk me into doing songs.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.820]   It's just singing songs that I had no business singing and I would spend like a month having
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.540]   to rehearse them because it's like, I know you want to hear me sing this, but this is
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.980]   so out of my lead.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.740]   Is that how you know...
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.020]   Prince's Kiss so very well is from those days.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.900]   No, that's why I was talking to my pitch tapes to him.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.060]   I was like, please, I got the Tom Jones shirt.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.860]   I'll get my hair permed and everything.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.380]   That was in our vesta, Vandy.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.780]   I just want you to know.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.140]   Of course it was.
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.140]   Of course.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.140]   Of course.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.140]   Yeah, you're right though.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.380]   Leo, like Disney has D23, which is like a fan event where they make announcements and
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.300]   stuff and they really kind of drink in the fact that there are hardcore fans who love
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.180]   Disney and all of Disney's products and they use it as a marketing tool.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.900]   It's also a money making event.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.540]   I've had that same thought which is I know it maybe doesn't feel like Apple, although
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:37.180]   Apple is very different now with all of its services and TV and movies and all that.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.140]   They are kind of leaving something on the table by not doing their own fan event, but
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.860]   I feel like they think it's beneath them.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.860]   Disney doesn't.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.580]   I kind of think it is.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.580]   Nothing's beneath Disney.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.580]   You've seen their program.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:56.060]   No, but Disney is the exemplar of how you should honor a fan base.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:04.060]   I'm uncomfortable with D23 because it takes something that is that I think that is kind
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.460]   of honest, which is, hey, we are an independent organization of fans.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.300]   We want to put on a fan con and basically is run by the fans.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.780]   It's done to the fans done with the fans.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.100]   Whereas, hey, we're trying to we're trying to monetize and organize our fandom and make
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.340]   sure that we can market to them in the most direct and efficient way possible.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.180]   If Apple were to do that, I think it would be fun, but it would already I think there's
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.460]   way too much fandom going on where people are just Apple.
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.500]   You are, let me get this straight.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:36.580]   You are fans of a $2 trillion company that has an immense amount of power in this world.
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.660]   But they are fans.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.660]   They are fans.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.660]   I know.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.660]   Don't be fans.
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.660]   Don't be fans.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.660]   I'm saying that.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.860]   Do you know how many Disney podcast there are in the world?
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.420]   But they're entertainment company.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.060]   They're not building technology that's for consumers.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.220]   I just think that it helps.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.380]   It helps a company like Apple to like not stay on this on the on the right path.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.380]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.540]   Except they also have movies and TV shows now, right?
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.540]   Except.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.140]   Except you can it's Ted Lasso Fest and Severance Con and whatever else.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.180]   But I mean and Mythic Quest Con like they have all of those too.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.220]   So it's getting I agree with you except it's getting real blurry.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.220]   So we could cosplay as the awkward awkward interfaces that it.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.220]   Like big and big and flatable like big and flatable blue buttons.
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.620]   When would you go if there were a Mac world Expo coming up?
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.620]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.620]   Well, and I think the question is if they were good.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.980]   I think they were if they were if they were if they were a Mac world Expo kind of like
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.940]   the old one where you go to the back of the room and there are these all these kiosks
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.060]   with independent developers who want to show you what they've been working on and they've
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.180]   been very proud of learning about things I didn't learn about before.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.220]   And in a place where they know that they're going to be talking to fans.
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.780]   I mean a lot of a lot of.
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:54.100]   Apple would speak to you and the Apple team would you know be there and I just think that's
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.300]   a I think maybe the problem is too big.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.260]   Is it just too big now that you can't do it.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.020]   So many people a million people would show up and well I mean you just say this is how
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.020]   many we can fit.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:07.700]   There's only so many tickets and then the you know I think that I think that you could
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.540]   fill up Moscone with a huge Expo.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.220]   I don't know if you need the sessions anymore.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.180]   You know like I don't you know I think you could you could get rid of the sessions and
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.500]   put those on video and have some but you could have some great Q&A's like what does
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.900]   Comic Con do though Comic Con has panels where you.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.980]   Well and D23 has panels where they bring out the stars of their shows and all of that.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.100]   It's not it's not educational right like that that is a thing the Mac world Expo did
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.380]   honestly to sell a more expensive past that had education and that was the the plan there.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:39.580]   But you know they do get Comic Con and D23 and all of that like I think it's actually
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.660]   quite telling the Disney like Apple rather than just going to Comic Con has its own event
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.820]   that they do the sell.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.820]   They control.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.020]   They get they get they get every dollar they can get from it.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:55.940]   Why you know exactly why are we why are we allowing people to make money off of conventions
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.220]   where people come up dressed as Iron Man if people we should have our own convention where
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.780]   people come dressed as Iron Man.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.740]   What what what what what what what what about this what if we had something that was more
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.420]   like a music festival where there was a main stage where Apple people Apple uses it's
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.820]   contact within the music industry to have really good acts like for two days next that
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.980]   is a is like a show pavilion that has a lot of like what we want to keep from the old
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.180]   Mac world and also for the fandom stuff and also for Apple to be able to say hey we want
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.860]   to I'm I'm this engineer and I've behind the scenes I've been cleared to talk about the
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.900]   following 19 things and not 20 of them.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:35.140]   But hey I'm gonna talk to you about how what it was like to try to develop the AirPods
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.260]   because a lot of those stories are getting lost and that's the sort of fandom stories
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.380]   that I think would be very very positive as opposed to making people into more obedient
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.060]   and loyal customers which is the only thing that I fear about that kind of a fandom thing
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.540]   with the 23 and an Apple show.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.460]   What you could do is is Mac Fest we should start it we're all going to start Mac but
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.460]   we'll call it Paul.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:58.900]   No as Paul Kent and Mac world learned without Apple it's not the same.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.700]   It was much smaller it was a much smaller Apple than it is.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.720]   And again I think that I think that the hard part is is that the sessions are really
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.700]   painful to support you know I've supported a lot of sessions and must go and from a lot
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:15.140]   of different companies and you know just that's a huge cost a big overhead where you
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:20.620]   could have an expo that is much more efficient and then do other things as and again you
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.620]   can command a bigger if you're doing concerts and stuff like that you can make it $100 ticket
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.620]   $100 ticket.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:31.780]   I believe the other the other dose of reality is that I mean a lot of us I've run into
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:36.040]   this conversation knows what Apple was like not only during the second time they were
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.960]   doomed but the first time they were doomed when it really was a community where if you
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.600]   used a Mac you if you knew that some if you met somebody all you knew is that they they
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.920]   used a Mac you knew that we have some sort of intersection of personality of likes and
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.680]   dislikes and tastes it wasn't really a mainstream thing by any means whatsoever you're actually
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:59.080]   swimming against the tide in order to do it and that created this sort of community of
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.940]   a fellowship whereas there's Apple is so successful right now that I'm not saying that there is
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.980]   none of that today but there are great many people that buy an iPhone because it is their
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.900]   phone and they're not I don't think it's just it's just the device that they like they
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.780]   don't if they said and if they if you prefer went up to them saying hey for $50 you can
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:21.700]   spend a weekend here even in your home in your own town on an expo a fan a fan fest for
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.660]   Apple they said well why but what why would I want to do that but what am I gonna do go
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.760]   a fan expo for my the people who may matter refrigerator it's like I don't care I know
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.820]   I don't think it's I don't think it's to help Apple I think it's to help Apple's ecosystem
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.340]   so so the thing is all those developers and all the manufacturers and all the if I knew
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.200]   that I could have a CES that was only for Apple products I totally be there especially
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.680]   in San Francisco like if I just knew that you didn't have to do all the walking from
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.900]   the South Hall I mean from the South Hall to the North Hall to the center hall and it
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:55.540]   was just it was like it was just one big haul and it was just Apple products there's a lot
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.520]   of people that would show up and there's a lot of press that would show up for that because
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.400]   it's big it's a big market and we could basically just have the non everything else
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:09.080]   and you signed me up for world pool world 23 we're gonna talk about the ice trays we're
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.800]   gonna talk about the crisper it's gonna be a session about where you slide the moisture
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.000]   controller you've done you've seen the side by side washer dry you've seen the one on
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.120]   top of the other now we have a new innovation they go diagonally we're gonna dishwashing
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.580]   demos is like where do you put the plates where do you put the bulls so that the bulls get
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:32.620]   cleaned all it's gonna be and plus the fan part where there should be a whole panel on
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:37.340]   for a job to the man who is a man like they need a whole panel on that and we can have
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.180]   a debate a man for him the me tag repair man is gonna come in and he's gonna be mobbed he's
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:47.580]   gonna call he's a star I'm Jesse white cosplay I'm so totally into that and I can say a I
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:53.600]   driven water dispensers that's all that I mean a I you know a I driven yeah actually
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:26:01.000]   this was yes was supposed to be right originally I will propose my first panel how chat GPT
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.120]   is poised to disrupt the disrupt free soak cycles I do have to point out and we covered
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.700]   it on Tuesday and Sunday on Twitter there were a lot of homo appliances mentioned at
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:21.240]   CES is your talk about a G monogram mixer we talked about new mowing faucets we talked
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:28.380]   about new poo poo sensing toilets from Kohler I mean you know you saw the the P thing that
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:34.960]   you pee on in your time I mean that this was all about CES was very much about home appliances
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.180]   we need a Mac world Expo but I don't I still think without Apple and a big key the keynotes
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:46.720]   the draw yeah and honestly without Steve Jobs maybe there's there's no point in doing it
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.900]   it might be that they just thought well we don't we don't want to make Tim suffer with
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:58.100]   a five person audience or something I don't know Alex I think so I think I think I think
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:02.500]   someone like you actually could do something legitimately it's a fairly great where we don't
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.740]   we I don't think they're getting people into a room together just again to celebrate the
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.580]   two trillion dollar companies is a good idea but like what if they said you know what we're
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:16.820]   going to be doing a two a two day streaming fest of of basically people who love Apple
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:21.820]   and developers who are really really fine tuned and do great things for about Apple and there
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.860]   would be people who be watching this the live stream live there would be people who be looking
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:30.180]   at the content weeks later but cure a curated two day panel schedule of discussions and
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.220]   demos of really weird and wonderful things that can only be done about Apple developers
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:40.260]   yeah that's interesting we we've been coaxing towards that during WWDC so we've had a couple
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.060]   sessions you know that we do that we do a little coverage and first it was one and then
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.580]   it was two and then it's so we've we've definitely been thinking about you definitely using
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:53.100]   WDC as you had an unconference right next to it you're right I remember yeah and we have
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.620]   and what we have it now we do it every year now with with you know we have the other conferences
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:01.940]   yeah yeah well and but I think that we're I mean I'm definitely looking at how do we do
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:07.660]   content adjacent to conferences yeah I think there's a lot of interest and so we're we'll
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:12.140]   probably our next larger one will probably be at NAB and but then WWDC is one we do every
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.140]   year where we have we bring developers in and talk about it but what I was already scribbling
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:24.020]   notes down world and he was talking of going round panels of previous developers and and
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.980]   folks and once they're out of the so there's differing different different constituencies
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.860]   for this a lot of you know when people say oh I'm glad I'm going to see yes it's not
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.020]   because they can't wait to see the walking refrigerator it's because they want to see
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.140]   their friends right it's about social and so there's definitely that contention the the
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.660]   contingent that wants to see you know it was it was for many years the gathering of the
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.500]   tribe and you would get to see all the people you know you see Chris Breen on his on his
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.220]   keyboard and stuff and then there's another constituency of people like Alex Lindsay who
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.780]   want to meet the developers look at what's coming out and right you know that's a big
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:00.620]   consistency I'm just thinking that really what app the the bet that Apple's missing is
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:05.340]   is not necessarily any of that it's just that that's how you spin up a fan base into
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:11.620]   absolute art or that's the that's how you get people storming the castle maybe Apple
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:17.300]   doesn't want to do that anymore come to the minute give us our headphones track give us
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:23.660]   our head back in fact the way that that you see Apple in modern context has reacted most
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.060]   of the fact that they have this huge audience in this huge audience contains a subset that
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:35.100]   are die hard fans the only real I'd say example of them catering to that is self serving to
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.860]   and it's the Apple Park Visitor Center where they built an Apple store with that observation
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:43.300]   lounge and the VR thing across the street from Apple Park and the reason they did it is to
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:51.020]   give fans a place they could go to the other side the security exactly right Stephen there
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:56.380]   no yeah yeah no he's not I mean that would be weird right like that would be like Lenin's
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:01.540]   tomb they could have a little yeah right and even people I mean he is in there in a way
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.380]   but not that way not so yeah but it's funny because that was built I mean it was built
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.580]   to know that the people would come but it was also built to keep them in arms length and
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:15.500]   I think that's a very Apple approach to the situation and look at you know the uprisings
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:22.420]   they ignored us on the butterfly keyboard forever and now they're by the way the lawsuit class
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:28.820]   you get your class your class action postcard in the lawsuit you get up to $350 if you I
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.780]   don't remember bringing in a butterfly keyboard for repair but did we John no because you
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.180]   have to have brought it in for repair but you can get up to 350 bucks back you can get
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:42.100]   some money back so look for your postcard if you did so but they ignore I think they ignored
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.580]   us for a long time on that remember Steve Jobs and this was still in the Mac world Expo
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:51.900]   time his reaction to the iPhone 4s problem is you're holding it wrong I mean I think
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.340]   there is this prickliness inside of Apple where they you know we do want to keep them
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:01.740]   a little bit of an arms length let's put them in the visitors center far far away from us
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:06.580]   maybe that's the modern times in the size of the company also else yeah and also snip snow
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:11.460]   it's no accident that they put their the venue in which they where they where they hold the
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:16.820]   press events are also outside the security curtain so that which is which is terribly
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:22.300]   convenient it's it makes sense but also but also it's different from it's it's different
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:27.500]   from saying it's if this is exactly the the facility they wanted to build and it really
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:32.220]   is very very well built I mean it's that I don't necessarily like if I'm swing if I'm
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.740]   really normal person just swinging through Cupertino I wouldn't really want to like do
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.900]   the Google thing where hey it's technically a public street I can this is something stopped
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.660]   me from riding my car like for on this campus but I but hey if there's if there's a if I
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:48.060]   know there's a actually this is a I think this is an exclusive I happen to be where it
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:53.820]   wearing like an exclusive a pen that you can only get like the old like the one infinite
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:58.260]   loop right it's kind of nice to have that little souvenir that special t-shirt you could
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.980]   only get at this one place so yeah people go away happy Apple goes away without having
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.020]   been disrupted there is something and we keep it that one infinite loop can't store that
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:11.020]   was on the actual campus and you parked in an actual campus parking lot walked into
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:15.380]   a building that was the building that a lot of executives also in and I think that they
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:20.100]   regretted that over time clearly we see that now they built their own little fortress when
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:25.180]   they built the ring campus there was a lot of talk about the semiotics of a campus that
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:30.700]   faces inward yeah outward and is really a wall to the outside world a barrier to the
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.500]   inside world yeah I mean it's the theaters outside of it right yeah but we want to keep
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:42.100]   the journalists is outside the ring you know yeah there's the centers you know ring that
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:46.500]   we'd only you got to be very special to get in there although people face out from that
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:51.060]   building to face but wait but the whole thing is built in a way that you're seeing terrain
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.380]   and then the hills in the background and not really seeing like the neighborhoods of the
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:33:00.300]   area so it is exactly as unconscious perhaps but there's a little message there I think
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:05.700]   I was at the public street without barriers without gates without security I mean he was
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.740]   really out there so I don't know if it's Steve Jobs thinking or maybe it's his later thinking
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.140]   he designed it yeah I mean he did design it yeah well he and it was Johnny and something
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:21.260]   to do with it too and I can imagine Johnny saying let's I let's build a perfect circle
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:27.100]   and yes and no one can get in yeah exactly you know I always thought that was a missed
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.580]   opportunity I mean they're building a corporate campus that has to be a functional part of
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.220]   the company so they're not they're not basically trying to win a design competition like Frank
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:39.460]   Lloyd Wright was famous for designing beautiful groundbreaking structures that fall apart almost
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.460]   immediately with really leaking roofs I mean it's not that supposed to do that but I thought
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.780]   I was disappointing that they've just plopped this thing that offers no visual interest
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:52.940]   whatsoever to people who do not work for Apple if you're driving past it it's just this big
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:57.020]   hulking thing that's sort of by the highway we're asked they could have built something
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:03.660]   that was that that was part of a could have been part of the signature Cupertino landscape
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.620]   even if you don't work for Apple here's a beautiful piece of architectural art that you
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.340]   that you drive past in your way home or any way off to work your day roughly the same
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.620]   time Apple was building that Amazon built its campus in Seattle and it's exactly that
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:21.340]   it's a it's part of the community and perhaps you know the Facebook campus and the Google
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.580]   campus down in Mountain View same thing where they really were much more open anyway that's
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:33.340]   a long way to go on a 16th anniversary yeah state come back next June and we'll do it all
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:38.540]   over again exactly was also the anniversary of the first use of keynote and that I think
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:42.100]   you have some of these about Alex no I don't think it was the first to use it was you know
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:47.660]   but I know that's fine okay they were dark in secret that was that was one of the most
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:53.820]   most beautiful Apple stories ever where they they they announced this this amazing presentation
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:59.100]   app that is so revolutionary that it almost boggles the mind to compare it to whatever
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:04.100]   to PowerPoint or anything else that was available at the time it was almost even even even
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:08.700]   soon and then and then to find out that oh by the way Steve Jobs has been using it as
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.940]   his personal presentation tool for a long long time and I can know I can I can only
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:19.860]   list imagine like all of these engineers like watching keynotes with their faces like this
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.900]   so we're kind of knowing that Steve is running with just the latest build of pre-release software
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:28.260]   and hoping to God nothing happens because if something happens guess what I'm not going
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.980]   to be I'm not going to be attending my my daughter's hockey game next week because I'm
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:36.020]   going to be I'm going to be an Apple jail working on this project for another two weeks
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:42.780]   yeah yeah it it's really revolutionary I mean you know I talk about this until my talks
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.180]   and it's the most important piece of visual software ever made like it you know like it's
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:52.060]   not when you look at how it affects people that do teaching how it affects you can build
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.620]   entire videos I have built like sketches of it for videos for a client and they were
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.860]   like yeah that looks great what what what what where do you know how do we close this
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.940]   up and I'm like that was the preview like I was like oh it's a preview with you we're
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.940]   going to do it in motion and we're going to make it all pretty and everything else and
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:14.960]   but but the ability to build entire whole videos it has probably moved more money than
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.760]   any other app out there because you know in most in many in much of Cupertino or not just
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.260]   Cupertino in much of the South Bay you know they say that it's a you have a deck or a demo
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:31.620]   and the deck is almost always built in Keynote it is for a long time for many years until
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:37.180]   they people got wind of it outside of the production area if you gave us anything we
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:41.620]   would turn it into Keynote so you know it was so much better at playing everything back
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.780]   the video the animations the layout and so we would you would give us a power point I
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.700]   mean literally companies that were very tightly wound around things would give us a power
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.260]   point or they'd give us slides or they'd give us something else and we would we say we're
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.300]   just going to prep it for broadcast and what that meant was going to import it into Keynote
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.380]   and we're going to redo everything inside of Keynote so that it'll play out correctly
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:06.180]   so that we don't have to deal with the weird things that your presentation apps do and
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:12.140]   so so for many from at least a decade solid there was you know somewhere between like 20
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:18.700]   or 2005 and 15 or 2006 it was all Keynote you know and it's just so much it just ran
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.300]   so much better and the little things that Apple does that makes it different are things
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:28.460]   like kerning and line spacing is much better and anti-aliasing along the edges much better
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:34.660]   in Keynote today than it is in PowerPoint yep it's a super subtle thing but it but it
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:39.740]   just it looks more refined like literally just typing words into it looks better than
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.460]   than than it does in PowerPoint and it's and it's and it's it's a weird it's a weird
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:49.580]   thing so it has that Apple you know touch to it that makes it very refined but it has
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.740]   so many tools that I think most people don't you know don't use I was just spent this morning
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:58.940]   my someone gave us a deck and my what my wife does and I said let's fix this.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:02.540]   I started like going through all this stuff and make sure to do it this way make sure
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.700]   to do it that way and I think that but it is it is again it's probably the app I've used
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.780]   the most I use a lot of visual apps the app I've used the most in the last 20 years I
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:16.060]   think I think I was really instrumental in in introducing the sort of smart guides and smart
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:20.940]   alignment like all those things where you move things and it marks you and says this is centered
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:25.020]   this is aligned properly this is aligned to this object it's so it's so good I worked
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:30.860]   in a company that everybody did these PowerPoint presentations and so I I was living that double
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.020]   life where I had to do some things in PowerPoint and some things in Keynote and the ones I did
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.940]   in PowerPoint every time I'd be like I cannot believe how bad this is and that this is the
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:45.740]   standard and Keynote was so good like so spectacular and he is so spectacularly good
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:51.660]   it's just yeah it's one of my favorite pieces of software ever and I don't make as many Keynote
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:56.700]   presentations as I used to but boy it just like all the details and you can tell like it was
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:02.460]   invented in part for one user who had who sweated the details and so that's what it does it was
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:08.220]   it was I mean I I used to give like at least a presentation a month like to use a group or
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:15.340]   to a company or or as a Keynote and before Keynote came along I was the person who just had just a
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.220]   sheet of paper with a handwritten outline that maybe yes I worked a long time on but the idea of
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:25.180]   turning that into a slide deck was so cumbersome and such a pain in the butt especially making
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.500]   changes on the fly which is something that I almost always do up until the last minute
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:35.740]   and then having Keynote where it totally flipped the script where I was actually designing
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:40.780]   planning out my ideas in Keynote and then thinking actually this it would be easier to make this
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:46.620]   transition to from this concept to another if I actually did a visual transition from one to
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.540]   another the idea of saying here's where I want this thing this object to start here's where I wanted
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:56.860]   to end here's what I want to happen between that start and that end and it's not in five years ago
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.940]   you would have been accused of oh my god you spent all your time designing this incredible piece of
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:06.540]   computer art instead of actually focusing on your ideas whereas this you know with Keynote it was
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:13.020]   no I was I was I was rehearsing my my my talk in the hotel room two hours earlier oh yeah I changed
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:18.060]   I changed one slide then realized that hey wouldn't be cool if this line actually that was on the top
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:23.580]   of the previous slide slid down to the bottom to basically give people an eyeball transition then
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:28.540]   that's what I did that's amazing and there's so many transitions I mean I raised a million
[00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:36.220]   dollars with a one keynote deck and it was and part of what made it work was that it it uh there
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.820]   were the whole bunch of people before me that they were all presenting to the same group and they
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.060]   were one one actually didn't excel which was kind of amazing that they did it but no I wouldn't
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.220]   recommend it but there are a lot of power points and they were all the power point kind of things
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.460]   that you're used to death by power point and then I had this super visual one that just like
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:57.500]   growing all those transitions and all the moves and just breaking animating in animating out and and
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.300]   I was the only one anybody talked to at the end and the and the main thing is is that I and I
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.700]   that's when I really got the power of being able to build a good deck yeah and and it was you know
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:11.660]   and it does make it you know really fun and I think that you know at 20 years old this this year
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:16.220]   next year will probably be the biggest year for keynote because I think that Apple's gonna release
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:22.780]   you know 3d support there's 3d support in mail in messages in motion in final cut in the you know
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.340]   on the OS I mean at some point we're gonna be able to drop models into it and rotate them around
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.780]   and when that happens you know it's gonna be the only app for a while that does that and
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:37.260]   it's gonna be it's gonna change a lot of things really fast do you think that's an opportunity for
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:41.580]   Apple to create a new style of presentation where it's not based on a slide deck it's based on
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:47.580]   here is how to create a presentation video for this note there's not even the there's not even
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:51.500]   the pretense that this is a sense of slides that you're going to be going through this is a video
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.420]   you're going to be creating with talking points during the middle of it that's how I do it now
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:00.300]   like that that's how I mean I when when teachers ask me how what what should I learn should I
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:05.820]   even learn iMovie or final cut to do movies for for my for my students I'm like you know
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.780]   that's how you do it and so what you do is you put all the all those pieces in and you say export
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:15.260]   as quick time and you just and you can export here's a tricky thing in keynote you can export
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:21.660]   with alpha channels in keynote so you can actually set it to pro res 4444 and export it out with
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.820]   if you want to comp them over other things I've there are things that I've done in regular
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:30.860]   sales things that basically I'm doing a whole bunch of stuff in motion but it's actually easier
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:35.500]   for me to do this six seconds in keynote so i'll just switch over to keynote build build what I
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:39.900]   wanted to do and hit export because I want some stuff to drop down or something and the behaviors
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:45.820]   and key note are better than anywhere else to do that and so i'll do something really quick in keynote
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:51.260]   export that as a movie drop it into final cut next to a whole bunch of things with motion you know and
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.620]   and so it's it is uh it's a it's a it's a end to your point most people don't know that it is an
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:02.220]   incredible video creation tool that's already built to do all of those things but I think the
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:07.260]   next generation will be when you start seeing 3d models you might send something to someone
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:11.660]   published something out of keynote or out of pages and someone's gonna be able to you know tap on
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.660]   it and have it appear on their desk so like that you know they can just see it as an image but if
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:19.100]   they tap on it they're gonna get to visualize it as well and I think that you know I think that
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:24.140]   apple has missed the boat missed that boat for a decade with books that what they should have
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.900]   done is redefined what books are instead of trying to compete with amazon and hopefully they're
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.740]   gonna this is going to be their ability to kind of come back to that so it's anyway it's it's
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:38.380]   exciting i think it's it's an exciting it's been a great 20 years for me and i think the next
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:46.780]   decade is going to be pretty interesting too 2003 it was announced in fact steve has a big slide up
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.260]   behind him saying built for me
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:59.020]   built for me it wasn't any and a lot go ahead a lot of people say the best software development
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.700]   or the best product development is someone scratchy and itch and when that person happens to be the
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:11.260]   CEO of a very busy yeah no kidding uh also announced in 2003 but was this you think what do you guys
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:17.020]   think was 2003 kind of peak steve jobs because they announced quite a bit in 2003
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:23.660]   oh i think i think you can't 2006 has to be the peak just because of the iphone yeah that was
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:30.060]   it's for i mean any of us who were there the glee in his eyes the knowledge of the surprise he was
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.500]   even though people knew that this was going to be an iphone announcement the glee that he could
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:38.460]   finally talk to six thousand three thousand fans about about this thing that they've been working
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:44.540]   on for years and years and years the devilish almost impish way he's just you know no i we haven't set
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.980]   up a phone call with starbucks we're just going to call this person and they're going to they're
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.180]   and this person who answers does not know they're going to be part of one of the most important
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:58.300]   important uh uh presentations in tech history uh i think that that is absolutely the that's absolutely
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:03.900]   the pinnacle of steve which is 2007 keynote it's hard to hard to beat yeah we're just all lucky
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:10.380]   sorry not to see those uh yeah exactly and even the 2010 keynote the ipad for the ipad too he was
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:14.540]   he was that he was at low power but yeah he was kind of you know yeah but still sort of thing yeah
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:20.220]   i'm just thinking this 2003 they announced so much stuff so they also announced safari which kind
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:27.020]   of took everybody off guard uh when they announced safari don melton had a great post he was uh was he
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:33.260]   the executive in charge is that no he was the developer of let's get i wrote it okay yeah he and
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:39.100]   a couple of other people yeah don he was working i know don a little bit he's he's uh he's retired
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:45.660]   now but yeah he he helped make this thing that it's funny i i wasn't surprised by it i remember the
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:50.460]   day before mac world x but we were talking about this i was visiting with adam angst from tidbits and
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.620]   we were talking about it and it was very clear that something was going to happen and there were the
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:59.020]   rumors about the apple web browser and the thing that the reason it made sense to me at the time
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.820]   and we got to go back right like 2003 oh my god the world was so different than it is now but one of
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:09.260]   the big things about it was internet explorer was the default browser on the mac and i you know my
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:16.220]   first cover story at mac user magazine back in '97 uh something like that was about what the
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:21.980]   the best browser for the mac and it it actually i.e. was the best browser it was better than net
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:29.500]   scape it came in it was fast but by '03 it was slow and it was worse it was slow compared to i.e. on
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:35.500]   windows and so anybody who did a windows versus mac comparison would fault the mac for being bad
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:41.260]   at the internet specifically bad at web browsing and keep in mind you know the iMac is out there
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.340]   apple's really trying to make a go of it and yet one of it's Achilles heels and when we think about
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:51.340]   apple's core philosophy that what you don't do is let somebody else control a key part of your
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:58.940]   business that one of the if not the root of that is that a key part of the mac business was the i.e.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:04.300]   code base that Microsoft didn't really care about that much and it made apple look bad and the mac
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:10.620]   look bad and that's why they did safari is because apple said we have to have a good web experience
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:16.060]   and microsoft doesn't care that the they like that the mac is worse at this and i don't think it was an
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:22.060]   active sabotage of the mac but the fact was that Microsoft cared very much about the windows i.e.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:26.940]   experience and on the mac yeah whatever we'll have something there and yet the mac was being judged
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:33.100]   based on that and that's why safari came to exist. It's bead was the number one priority because they
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:38.540]   did not want to look bad compared to windows i remember in those days we were using i never used
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:46.220]   i.e. it was awful but we were using weird stuff like chimera remember that and i cab i was gonna
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:51.660]   say cab but i cab there were third party ones most of them based on gecko the gecko engine
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:59.260]   in was it was it wasn't firefox yet it was something Mozilla netscape or something and
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:07.180]   that's yeah and so it was there was definitely a market for third party ones but there wasn't a
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:13.740]   great browser what did you any i and i was preloaded and on by default right so it was when you
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:19.420]   reviewed a mac compared to a pc that's what you would review it based on i.e. and i.e. wasn't at
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:23.420]   that point was just not very good and certainly not as good as on windows there was no chrome at
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:30.380]   the time yeah there was for linux users there was something different it came with the kde desktop
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:39.500]   called kh tml it was a html browser and as melton tells the story uh apple bravely at the time because
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:47.180]   gecko was the big dominant uh engine at the time chose kh tml an open source oh yeah there's kamino
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:54.860]   oh i guess that was camino camino is what i used yeah i used camino uh so people thought they
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.820]   that apple if they were going to do a browser would use gecko because that was dominant but no
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:05.740]   instead and actually i kind of honor them for this they looked around and found kh tml
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:12.540]   and uh in fact steve said at the keynote we based safari on an html rendering engine
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:24.300]   that is open source uh kh tml and kj as the code inside kde's conqueror with a k web browser on linux
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:33.900]   in fact this uh i i a little bit annoyed me don said after the keynote was over and safari was
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:39.260]   announced i sent an email to the kde team to thank them and introduce ourselves
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.660]   like dudes if you're gonna fork a project i guess this is apple secrecy right
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.580]   uh but if you're gonna fork a project it's kind of polite to say hey we're
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:55.020]   working on it maybe even giving them a chance to participate uh webkit is based on that we're
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:50:03.900]   still using it so yeah kk kh tml became essentially webkit and then and even you know even google
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:09.660]   stuff is a branch of webkit that is now gone and been its own thing so in some ways this ends up
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:17.020]   being the the uh origin of sort of modern web browsing is this moment yeah uh he talks about
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:22.540]   sitting on the day of the actual keynote only a few of us from the safari team were in the audience
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:27.660]   employee passes are always limited at these events for obvious reasons but we did have great seats
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:33.020]   just a few rows from the front but he says you didn't want to be too close in case something really
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:39.260]   went wrong within throwing distance yeah yeah apparently uh that is not a good thing six minutes
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:44.860]   32 seconds sounds like you had a timer running steve talked about safari on stage he says for
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:50.620]   that time i don't remember taking a single breath he was just saying stay online stay online stay
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:58.380]   online but it worked flawlessly steve put up a big slide with one word kh tml six foot high
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:03.420]   white letters in a blue background if you listen that video down writes i noticed that no one
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:10.300]   applauds why i'm guessing confusion and complete lack of recognition but you can't hear also on the
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:15.180]   video someone about 15 to 20 rows behind where we were sitting obviously expecting the word get
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:20.860]   go up there instead of kh tml shout at what seemed like the top of his lungs what the f
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:30.300]   uh that's great yet you you know don huh that's yeah he doesn't mean comfortable podcast in fact
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:35.260]   now i thought so yeah he is a he's a cranky retired man who is a lot of fun to talk to and
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:41.260]   swears a lot so we have to bleep him but uh he is a incredibly smart guy and i i think relieved to be
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:46.060]   retired but uh he was present at the beginning he says he's a recovering programmer
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:52.460]   yeah yeah that's about that about it great post at donmelton.com if you want to read about the first day
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:59.260]   of saffar yeah oh yeah no he said i'm looking right now the the bok donmelton.com the safari's
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:03.580]   release to the world there's nothing that can fill your underwear faster than seeing your product
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:11.180]   fail during a steve jobs demo uh so i think we all agree this was the right thing
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:18.460]   to do safari lives today 20 years later uh is still a very fast very uh accomplished web browser
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:24.300]   i'm a little i'm i'm glad safari exists because chrome and chromium and its derivatives are so
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:30.380]   dominant that's becoming a mono culture i use firefox almost entirely for that reason just to
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:37.020]   support a different engine and safari is probably thanks to the iphone uh right up there with chrome
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:43.020]   as most used uh browser yeah i mean it's definitely a minority but it's an important minority yeah um
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:48.300]   apples apples only challenge though is that they have to make sure that whatever uh they do have to
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:53.980]   address the fact that chrome is the default standard not not by any standards community but
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:59.580]   just simply their popularity and so if if google decides to bless a certain standard
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:06.460]   apple has to put away their opinion of what that standard is and ask themselves do we want
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:13.340]   safari users on iphones and max to have less usability or less compatibility with web uh with web apps
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:17.980]   or are we willing to do we want to stick our stick our heels in and say no we're not supporting
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:22.300]   this or before whatever reason and sometimes that is that web developers have to decide do i want
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:28.220]   to um knock iphones out of my user base and they don't so they say it's a it's a push and pull i mean
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:35.500]   as a user of i want to use these um web rtc based like podcasting tools like zencaster and they have
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:41.340]   a whole bunch of little web rtc and codecs and all this technical stuff works great on chrome
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:45.020]   and it still doesn't work on safari like five years later apples just like we're not interested in
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:50.220]   that and that's frustrating right like it is uh it is a challenge but apple has more upper hand
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:55.820]   than they did back in the day when i.e. was so dominant and and that's yeah it's a good thing
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:00.540]   also the open source thing is a huge thing right like i think apple had the courage to take kde
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:08.060]   and use khtml as the basis for webkit in part because they had had such success culturally with darwin
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:13.420]   setting up uh macos 10 based on an open source framework that they thought you know we could do
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:18.140]   this and this was at a time when like for i.e especially like that was the crown jewels that was
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:22.540]   stuff that you kept in a vault somewhere and so for them to pick up an open source project and say
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:26.460]   this is the most expedient way for us to get a fast browser and it's okay we'll make contributions
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:31.500]   to the community and it worked and they have and webkit is richer and the web is richer for it
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:37.100]   i'm still a little unhappy apple doesn't support progressive web apps as much as it should and
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:41.900]   that's really holding it at back as chrome and firefox actually firefox also backed down on
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:46.220]   progressive web apps so i can blame them both um i had high hopes for that but that was a
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:51.660]   microsoft google initiative obviously apples less interesting i thought maybe uh that that was
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:58.860]   apples backdoor way of surviving uh the crackdown on app stores is by saying well you can always
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:04.220]   make a pw a progressive web app and and and load that on the iphone much like in the earliest days
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:11.660]   of the iphone um but they don't seem to really like that much nevertheless uh you know it's a it's a
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:18.620]   good browser right you guys who use a safari here oh yeah i do not as my primary i use it i don't i
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:23.580]   i have to admit that i i use it primarily until i was doing a bunch of stuff with youtube and so
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:27.740]   and so for them everything that google does of course they test they test everything first on
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:30.700]   chrome so if you wanted you we needed to make sure everything was doing there so i got in the
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:36.620]   culture of doing it that way um i have to admit that with the whole last pass thing i'm kind of in
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:41.180]   this quandary of do i use i'm kind of thinking of you know moving away from last pass obviously and
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:47.020]   but it's a lot i mean i have 10 years of using it the um one of the things i have been thinking about
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:51.420]   is whether it's given that i don't really have a lot of pcs do i need a password manager that isn't
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:57.260]   just the apple apple is very good a lot of people very good i do a switch off as far as on sunday
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:02.940]   and ask the tech guys uh we talked about leaving last pass steve did a whole show on it last
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:07.180]   tuesday as well he'll talk more about it this week um you know his recommendation was he had
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:11.100]   it's time to get off last pass so we showed a little bit and talked a little bit about it but
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:16.300]   i got a number of emails from people saying well can i use uh the chrome browsers uh password
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:21.180]   store which syncs you can actually if you're in the apple ecosystem you can use apple's
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:27.020]   keychain it's quite good i think it's very secure and you can even run it on windows because you
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:32.860]   can install uh you know i cloud on windows and then you have access to the the uh password manager as
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:37.020]   well i don't know what you do on an android device though i don't i think you're out of luck i know
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:42.220]   yes it's more fluid for me because you know the biggest problem i have is with passwords is when i
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:46.060]   open up an app and it wants the password that i generated from a web you know like it's
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:50.220]   just not as hard to get launch you know it's so nice i think just use the iphone and the mac
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:55.820]   man it's yeah apple solutions really beautiful yeah and it makes good strong passwords that are
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:59.660]   nice and you know i mean you don't have a lot of control over it with bitward and you can say you
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:04.780]   know upper and lower case you want how long do you want it to be how many special characters you do
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:10.620]   all of this stuff with apple it's like this way this is it here you go that's a that's a strong one
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:17.820]   take it and uh i kind of would like more than that but uh you know it's not look at it's very secure
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:21.740]   it's very secure and you know i don't think you have the same problem you'd have with last pass
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:27.660]   i think the fear with going to say bitward or one password or uh dash lane is well is are we
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:33.980]   gonna have the same problem with with a leak of the of the vault and i think you can probably safely say
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:41.020]   apple's doing it all right and if even if that keychain were somehow stolen uh it's you know it's a
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:48.940]   tied tied to a hardware secure hardware store it's very unlikely to be able to crack that i think but
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:55.340]   yeah i'd like to um actually tie these two topics together and and and just say that
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:58:00.220]   the original iphone launch and safari are directly related because one of the things and he was
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:04.380]   saying you know it didn't do this it didn't do that and that's all true one of the revelatory
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:08.220]   things about that in addition to the fact that it was all touchscreen and that they had the ability
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:13.340]   to make an all-touch screen phone and not use that space for buttons people forget the touch was
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:20.060]   not out yet and no multi-touch was huge we had seen this uh carna this demo from carna g melon
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:25.820]   of this guy doing pinch to shrink and wide open and moving and everybody was going that's amazing
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:31.260]   that's awesome so when apple came out with a consumer device that did that remember just even
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:37.420]   be able to keep on showing your friends i was like look i can open a website and zit with safari
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:42.380]   and zit make it bigger smaller that was huge that was really big at that time yeah and then and
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:47.260]   then yeah that was the that was the breakthrough i think was it was uh as somebody went to palm
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:51.820]   trio at the time right like having a a internet with a bonus one thing i think all of us had the
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:59.260]   same app but having but having a real web browser that showed a real web page and it was a computer
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:04.060]   experience but on your phone that was a breakthrough moment even though there weren't other apps it
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:10.460]   was just the apple apps on there that moment of like oh i can get to the entire web from this device
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:16.060]   and it looks like the web and i can interact with it like the web except for flash uh but still it was
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:21.180]   a break it was except for flash they got they killed it yeah and that that was the end of it i i
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:25.580]   remember sitting in vegas at a after a ces and the guy sitting next to me i said what are you doing
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:29.260]   he was oh we're rebuilding our whole website a website that we finished two weeks ago oh and i
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:33.260]   was like and he said we spent two years on it and now we're back to square one i said why do we built
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:39.260]   the whole thing in flash it looks amazing and he said the ceo opened it up on his iphone and it
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:44.140]   you know didn't load and he just said he just said well why doesn't it you know why why doesn't work
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:48.700]   one of my own site doesn't work on my on my phone and they tried to explain it to him and he said that
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:54.540]   wasn't that wasn't really lost we chose the wrong framework boss he was just like you need to
[00:59:54.540 --> 01:00:00.300]   you need to solve that i know i'd be hopping man to fire him yeah for for the for the record the
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:06.140]   things that remember the steve jobs published a very very famous letter excoriating flash and
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:10.220]   saying that there's just you can't make an elephant fly and you can't put flash on a mobile device and
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:14.940]   this is why we're not supporting it and yeah but the thing is like later on a lot of devices we're
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:20.540]   supporting flash and none of what steve said that letter turned out to be true but i do appreciate
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:25.180]   all the reasons why he stood around that we didn't want to it was pretty power hungry but i was using
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:30.860]   by year after the iphone i was using a couple different devices that had flash and yeah used power
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:35.980]   but it not like an unso would absolutely kill the battery frame rate was fine streaming was fine
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:40.940]   i think i think it was a nice thing i just glad there was one guy in the world who didn't care a
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:46.940]   damn about technical debt and said screw it right we're gonna throw it all out because it's bad it's
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:53.260]   you know it's bad and and Andy you might have been able to tolerate it but it was bad and aren't
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:58.700]   you glad flash is going now it was also a huge security problem let me tell you we spent
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.860]   controlled by one company yeah there's so many things right i mean i'd flash it was the wrong way
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:10.220]   to design a website it's why you use open standards and yeah it was just it was a bad idea all around
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:15.340]   yeah but it it it sucked to have a phone that like would with with the prevailing video standard a
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.180]   lot of content was flashed and not be able to access that content but this is but this is one
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:24.700]   little pain is a good thing a little this is this is this and this is well this is what makes apple
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:29.900]   sometimes really frustrating and oftentimes of really really great forever product is time
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:35.340]   time and time again they do things like you could hey congratulations we did something that all
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:40.300]   all of our users have been clamoring for we deleted that pesky headphone jack say but no we like the
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:44.620]   headphone jack you're welcome like but the headphones we all have our headphones are like yes exactly
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:49.180]   we're the first people to be brave enough to do it and exactly and they'll give a lot of reasons
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:54.060]   why they did it that don't didn't turn out to be exactly true it came down to we are designed we
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:58.220]   are designing this for this product we can control the destiny of this product we think this is the
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:02.780]   best choice for the future of this product and therefore its users so the users are going to have
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:06.300]   to get used to the fact that they're going to have to have bluetooth headphones from now on so here's
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:14.140]   a question uh we are still on the iphone using flash i mean the safari and nothing but safari
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:19.420]   because even if you're using somebody else's browser which i do you still use a safari or web
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:25.580]   kit uh is that going to change because of the EU are we going to start to see apple i know i know
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:31.420]   exactly Alex Lindsay's going to say god i hope not but i care much less about that because of the
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.620]   side what you want to use and mark whatever browser you want to use it just won't work
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:38.860]   it seems like you should do it themselves mark german's reports suggest that they are
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.380]   considering that and that they may need to do that and that the idea there would be that if
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:46.940]   google wanted to make a version of chrome using google's engine instead of web kit because right
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:51.660]   now it is mandatory that they would they would change their rules and make that allowed and
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:56.300]   i think that's okay i mean there's a question of how much optimization work anybody who's got a
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:01.180]   big browser engine wants to do for ios but if google wanted to put the effort in and they
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:07.180]   you know the fact is that they're their browser on macOS is really energy hungry and bad and
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:12.300]   it people use it but it does kill the battery worse than safari does and so i think there would
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:17.900]   be an audience for chrome on ios that was proper chrome even if it did drain your battery faster
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:24.460]   because you know choice i think choice is good and i think to any previous point a lot of apples apple
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:29.740]   protests a lot and about about oh we can't do that because and some of their arguments are real
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:34.380]   some of their arguments are not real and some of their arguments are real but taken to an
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:39.340]   extreme that's unreasonable and i think that there are security arguments to be made about web browsers
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:44.060]   and and and the open web and how they need to lock things down there are battery arguments too
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:51.020]   but i think that the reality is that at this point in the lifecycle of ios you could have
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:56.300]   another browser engine it's not gonna it's gonna be fine i agree let's take a little break and then
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:00.780]   there is still other things to talk about but you see what i'm saying about anniversary is the gift
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.740]   that just keeps on giving what you just take this show and next year run the whole thing over again
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:14.380]   and i love it thank you everyone 21 years 17 years our show they brought to you by zach doc i use
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:20.060]   zach doc last night to find a doctor i think this is the greatest idea there's nothing worse
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:25.100]   than going to a doctor's appointment you expect to be well let's face the center of attention
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:29.980]   your doctor's like looking at his watch they got better things to do better places to be
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:37.020]   instead of listening to you asking you how you feel helping you get better the doctor is you know
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:43.260]   looking to play in words with friends so how do you find a good doctor that's the real question
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:47.660]   we've all had that experience of a doctor that's less than perfect they're just human i understand
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:58.140]   but how do you find a good doctor zach doc z o c d o c because zach doc has real verified reviews
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:05.180]   from its users so on zach doc you'll find quality doctors who will give you what you want if that is

[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:38.780]   possible on we go apple has released this is interesting and i haven't heard these yet but
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:47.580]   i think some of you have audiobooks with ai narrators it sounds really good does it
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:55.500]   depends on you let me let me it's it's go ahead i think i can play some so um can i on there this
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:10:02.300]   is the apple page uh there's there a sample here there's got to be somewhere explore some samples
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:09.820]   there yeah we're there okay so so you like it Alex and you don't like it Andy i just i think
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:16.940]   that it's typical of ai generated stuff where it will it's fine it's fine it's not gonna if you if
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:23.180]   you paid for an audiobook that would had this ai generated narration on it you'd be fine with it
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:28.460]   it's just not good well i'd rather have an actor do it because they really bring it to life i mean
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:31.660]   yeah i mean i mean i'm always going to do better than it but there are a lot of books that have
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:36.780]   never been audio narrated exactly that's and that's and that's a point my only fear with this is that
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:42.540]   now the default for audio publishing will be well of course when you use an ai if it's a very very
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:46.300]   special fancy book that we think we're gonna make a lot of money on then we'll hire an actual voice
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:51.500]   actor voice uh voice artist in order to produce it i mean i just i think it's okay i don't think i
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:56.300]   don't think it's bad i don't think it's particularly great it's fine it serves i just don't want it to
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:00.780]   become the default of our expectations for audiobooks that's all and i think that i think that one of the
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.060]   differences probably that you probably listen to a lot of fiction and i don't so i don't i don't listen
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:09.900]   to fiction i don't so i so i i that's what movies are for me so so i won't i do so i do listen to a lot
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:14.860]   of nonfiction too and even even when they're not performing like all this is he wants is there's
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:19.900]   an audio book it's such a such a fine skill so they do they have four different voices Madison
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:24.780]   Jackson Helena and Mitchell i don't know why the first three are cities in wisconsin in
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:29.580]   wisconsin of montana i don't know where Mitchell is let's see what Mitchell's voice is he does
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:35.900]   nonfiction i do know that there is an extraordinary sense here of caring and sharing and that the
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:41.340]   sharing in coir first of all i'm mad because they stole a real narrator's voice that is that is a
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:45.180]   voice i reckon i'm sure they like this i'm sure they like i hope they realize this is pros i'm sure
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:51.180]   they didn't steal it but i have to say that sounds like him responsibility reading it this is enough
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:56.780]   for me as the years add up i find increasing good sense in falling back this is the guy who does
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:03.500]   project hell mary all right here's Helena a digital voice also nonfiction on nights with a new
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:09.580]   moon we would walk to the end of the beach to find our favorite constellation the Pleiades oh
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:15.180]   now Andy that's pretty dang good and the two is a little bit better all right here's Madison this
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:21.980]   is for fiction and romance movement in the greenhouse drew his eye and a woman emerged at
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:27.980]   first he wasn't sure the woman was about the right age but there was something different about her
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:32.940]   about the way she carried herself so there is a Mitchell in wisconsin so we've got Madison and
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:38.780]   Mitchell in wisconsin and Jackson and Helena what Helena Montana Jackson Wyoming right all right
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:43.340]   let's try Jackson to find a wall of trees had materialized ahead of us oh these are surprising
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:48.300]   noticed because i'd been staring at my feet oh this is believe the feet you know what Andy
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:52.460]   i'm going to share your dismay only because i wanted to do this in my in in right retirement
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.620]   let's read some audio books and these are pretty darn good and considering they're free
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:02.620]   yeah they're they're good i actually i actually had to AB them a little bit myself because again
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:07.180]   i'm i my first reaction was my god this is a lot better than i assumed it would be it does
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:12.700]   i've heard audiobooks that would again if i ever see this as an audible book i would not give it a
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.700]   second a second thought i wouldn't be really impressed with it but i wouldn't give a second
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:22.860]   thought when i compared it to like an actual live narrator the one of the big things that i really
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:28.700]   kind of notice is that at the end of sentences there's a they they they they the the AI just hits
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:34.620]   a wall stops and then starts the next sentence whereas the it's it's more like with professionals
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:39.020]   there's oftentimes the i'm breathing in i'm breathing out this is where i'm doing the breath right here
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:44.540]   it doesn't it doesn't feel like here's not here's the fear's sentence number one and now here's
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:49.420]   sentence number two right i'm now reading sentence number three it's it's again it's fine i just
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:53.500]   to some degree i might prefer that because sometimes the narrators get in the way
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:59.020]   and actually i'm listening to one of the books you recommended and the book about the rosetta stone
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:06.380]   which i love but the narrator needs a producer because he mispronounces words a lot okay and and
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:11.180]   i don't know if an AI would mispronounce a word or not it's it's better i will concede absolutely
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.700]   it's better than bad narration any day yeah well the first first thing is i must have missed that
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:19.980]   episode what's the what's the one rosetta stone oh it's so good but it's about it's about how the rosetta
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:24.620]   stone was translated i just need the title i was called i was called the writing of the gods
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:31.660]   okay okay i'll hug it anyway so and it's by airy eric eric edward dolnik and then the narrator is
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.140]   perfectly good he's not he's not does it sound bad i listen i mean obviously voice quality
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:41.820]   and the capability to kind of communicate the ideas paramount but when they when they they need
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:45.980]   a producer because it's nobody's going to get all the words right and he gets a lot of them wrong
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:50.620]   it makes me cry jean i hear his is for instance i'm listening to technology book and they pronounce
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:57.180]   it clutch christmas just as a book where he said clutch go ahead my thing is i started getting
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:04.540]   into listening to um on on kindle on the kindle app on the phone if you use the amazon's you know um
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:10.300]   uh assistant and you ask to play a song and not play a song play a book it'll do it it's the
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:16.300]   only way you can get it to do audio like you know in on the on the iphone um and what i learned very
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:22.300]   quickly is that i could listen to an ai voice much faster than i could listen to a um and because i
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:27.900]   don't listen to fiction all i listen i mean like for me i am literally hoovering data and and so i
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:33.580]   just want i want that and i have a hard time i will lose track of the i will lose track of the book if
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:39.180]   it goes too slow yeah at one x i i think about all the things while they're talking at two x i just
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:43.180]   think about the book yeah you know and and so the and the thing is so i find it actually easier to
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:49.180]   concentrate on something that's moving faster than slower and the ai is easier to go faster because
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:54.460]   it's the diction is is cleaner to the point that ai was making the end those ends actually make it
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:16:00.460]   easier for me to hear at speed that's a good point the um uh the interesting thing is is that i think
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:04.460]   that the opportunity here i mean i think that the biggest books are all going to get
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:08.860]   still haven't someone narrating them and still have those out there but there is so many books
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:14.140]   like one of my favorite books that i that i read africa africa biography of a continent by john
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:23.580]   reader in the 90s is like 800 pages without on a long tail i would love for them to release that
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:28.460]   with one of these voices so that i could listen to it again you know and there's all these books
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:32.940]   that were never they're never gonna make financial sense exactly do this and now suddenly we're
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:37.420]   gonna be up for me and then i think about all of apple news apple news is already playing with
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:41.820]   narration and all you know that that's where they have great narration i mean the best actually
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:48.860]   the best narration i've ever heard from magazine is apple news um narration but i would love to
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:55.260]   know that every magazine every article every whatever was all you know um you know they're like
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:01.580]   the economist does it for every one of them um uh congress humans some of them they do but but
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:06.060]   the thing is is that that is not practical for most magazines economists and international
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:10.540]   it's you know and it doesn't make sense and so it like for instance foreign affairs and was one
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:15.900]   i've been listening reading since i was like 12 and and the the issue is is that foreign affairs
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:20.460]   doesn't put all the art is they only put the articles in that are paid for by noah and so
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:25.180]   so that you only get this little like one fifth of the of them every month magazine whereas this
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:30.460]   would mean all of it was a bill you're describing what is exactly right which is there is a kind of
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:35.740]   a a gulf there is people there are people who and some people who do both which i do and i'm sure you
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:40.860]   do listen for pleasure for entertainment listen for the art and then people listen for the information
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:45.420]   and it makes perfect sense for a competent ai especially because you can speed it up to read the
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:49.340]   stuff where you just want to get the information in and then there's then there's times when you
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:54.140]   want to listen to a performance and that's what a real reader is and i think Andy's wanting to
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:18:00.060]   hear the performance you would want to hear an opera done by ai because there's no art so
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:05.580]   but now here's the question and i hope this stays the case right now it's cheap to do ai
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:11.980]   and so there is that advantage in fact that's how apple's pitching this by the way every book
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:17.580]   deserves to be heard with apple books digital narration now yours can be which is a strange
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:23.980]   way to put that with apple books digital narration oh i get it now yours can be see that's why you
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:28.220]   have to have a human but that's what's so encouraging about this is there are so many books that are
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:32.940]   simply not available put out and they tell the economics don't work they tell indies how to do
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:38.620]   this or in fact they tell you how you can publish on apple books including publishing an audio
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:44.220]   version of your book which i think is fantastic so that's beneficial as long as but i bet apple
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:49.260]   charges the same amount for an ai book is for a non-ai book on audio right yeah i don't think that
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:54.140]   it's just a service to let you do it yeah i think honestly for the publisher it should be cheap
[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:58.380]   to get an ai book because that's five thousand dollars less that's what the standard radius for
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:02.940]   narrating a book say i guess five thousand dollars isn't that much cheaper over a million
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:10.540]   people but still um i feel like ai you should pay less for that am i wrong Alex no i i don't know as
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:15.260]   a consumer i mean i pay inaudible i pay in credits i don't know what the costs are paid for those credits
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:19.820]   trust me yeah it's kind of i do i have some monthly but but the point is is that it's um just
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:24.460]   because they've managed to obscure the actual cost doesn't mean it doesn't cost anything it's like
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.740]   it's like 25 bucks a month i think whatever the audible is 25 bucks a month i get enough
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:32.860]   i i always have credit i always have credit i wonder if audible would ever use this though this is
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:38.700]   interesting i i think i mean i i they might though because again this is the thing of like what happens
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:42.540]   to all the books we think of every book is having an audiobook they don't and if you're somebody who
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:46.860]   listens to audiobooks you know not every book has an audiobook and especially if it's a small press
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:51.660]   or an indie or something like that and so we can i mean everybody's rushing to oh no all audiobook
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:55.340]   readers are going to be put out of business which i i'm with andy i think that there is an art to a
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:59.340]   lot of this and that it's not necessarily true but there's an accessibility issue here which is
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:03.980]   lots of books aren't accessible they're just not accessible because they're the the economics
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:09.660]   don't pencil out and so and anybody who's listening to kind of like the really cheap crappy uh voice
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:15.100]   synthesis in a book or a magazine or newspaper it's it's on it's unlistable it's terrible right you
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:18.620]   can't you maybe for a short amount of time but not over long term so if you can get
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:25.180]   good ai to make all of these books that never had an addition for audiobook audible i mean
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:31.260]   generically not trademark of audible like just to be able to be listenable that's a i think that's
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:35.100]   a huge win for the authors it's interesting that these are in specific categories i was talking to
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:39.660]   my friend dan moran who is a science fiction novelist in addition to being my co-writer he has a very
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:44.140]   good reader on his books by the way and he has he has an excellent reader in fact so good that people
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:48.860]   will have discovered his books because they will listen to anything that that reader does but he
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:53.260]   but he says you know first off it's part of the author economics to sell audio rights and and
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:57.660]   that's a big deal but also there's this challenge which is what if you sign a deal and there's no
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:02.300]   audiobook and everybody comes to him and says when will the audiobook be coming out like if you don't
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:08.540]   have an answer you are losing customers however dan's a science fiction novelist and he has to provide
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:13.180]   a pronunciation guide to his reader right because he because it's got lots of made up science fiction
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:19.100]   in terms it's interesting that they've specified romance and nonfiction because it sounds to me like
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:24.540]   the other back-end work that's happening here is for each of these books they're probably trying
[01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:30.620]   to build sort of like proper pronunciations and in some wilder genres like science fiction it
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:35.020]   probably wouldn't work as well at least not yet right but i could foresee a day when those science
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:39.820]   fiction writers will be able to like you know put in their weird made up words and have it all be
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:45.900]   read correctly down the road do we know i'm looking at uh the audiobooks section of apples i books
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:53.020]   they don't have a this this one's narrated by a robot section i wish they did oh you can search
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:57.740]   there is an ai narration i think there's a search term you can put in books and oh okay let me see
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:01.420]   if let me see if you actually give you what it is because i would all buy one just to see
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:06.380]   how and i especially speeding it up era ai narration oh yeah
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:12.860]   oh yeah shelter from the storm narrated by apple books it says oh i'm sorry i didn't realize you
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:17.740]   were looking uh sorry it did be to all right so i should we listen to this romance novel
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:23.580]   shelter from the storm narrated by apple books i like this so yeah you can do that ai narration
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.860]   i don't know if i want to listen to a romance novel
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:31.420]   and again i look at it like all the when you're looking about apple news
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:32.060]   all of those things no no no no all our
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:45.740]   jacks the rebel princess say you love me trailer secrets the doctors unexpected family
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:50.220]   but like this is a great example i found one in here called the lumberjacks by donald mckay and
[01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:57.660]   it was you know it was shortlisted for an award in 1978 so it's a deep catalog non-fiction book right
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:02.540]   and it doesn't have an audiobook and so apple ran it through its system and now you can
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:06.860]   get an audiobook for the book that otherwise wouldn't have one that's great is it all about
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:13.180]   lumberjacks i don't know i mean the 19th century spawned a unique breed of men
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:20.140]   Donald McKay would been scared of some rough codes of conduct yeah uh it's 799 narrated by a
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:26.380]   digital voice shortlisted yeah no you found a good one you found a good one so yeah and i can
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:31.900]   also choose as narrator apple books i bet i can search for narrator apple books yeah okay
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:38.220]   well let's let's all try one what do you say kids and he would you be willing to give it a shot
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:43.420]   i will give a deflow to give a shot i want to see this the problem is most of the books i want to
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:48.540]   read are big enough that somebody's narrated but yeah if you were really in the lumberjacks
[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:54.780]   i can see i've been wanting to read that book since now i saw that in the list and i thought it was a
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:24:00.380]   romance novel about a guy in flannel and i thought well you know bros maybe it is yeah maybe it is
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:07.100]   i don't know uh listen to sample okay can we do this without getting in trouble let's see
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:17.100]   oh come on be brave be bold lagers in british columbia of the three interwoven ages of eastern
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:26.060]   canadian logging the first book about lumberjack no no no listen to it at two x oh yeah can i oh i
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:31.340]   can't miss sample probably uh that would be fun oh wait a minute yeah maybe it's a call let's try
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:35.340]   it at two x here we go the lumberjack the second age the lumber industry began up by sean timber
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:39.980]   the ground hounds of the night you don't listen like that Andy i mean uh i listen to oh yeah that's
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:44.220]   how i listen to candida and open seemingly endless forests of spruce okay that's one and a half that's
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:47.420]   usable in british columbia i'm getting anxious just listening to the same
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:50.460]   all right that's how i listen to everything
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:57.020]   digital jacks on meth i feel like i feel like when i when i go back to one act like i'll be
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:00.220]   what what happened to the phone like the person's it's all struck out like what i'm actually
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:04.140]   pointing because apple's doing the same thing with the digital narration that they do with a human
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:10.060]   narration which is using a special tool to speed it up and by taking out bits and that's not how
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:14.620]   they should do it they should have the ai read it faster they could do that right just say hey i
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:18.220]   read it to x please and then it wouldn't sound so burbley will just sound like the a's talking
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:24.300]   fairly fast yeah i don't i'm sure that's a one point oh one point one feature right is it's really
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:28.780]   what's that tool called uh Alex we used to call it a harmonizer i don't know what they use these days
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:34.380]   but you can speed it actually every software yeah all text to speech engines have that right of
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:39.900]   how fast or slowed you want the speech to be able to read it faster instead of doing the digital
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:44.220]   thing where it speeds it up and it gives you that weird kind of little bit of thing sound right
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:47.660]   you just you just wanted to act like it's really caffeinated yeah it might it might
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:51.740]   it might be hard i think let me jacks of the greatest hammer i want to tell you all about the
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:56.780]   british colombian let's put some western janina i i don't know i i i'm not sure which one i would
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:59.980]   prefer because i i think that i i think i'm talking about the coffee industry now
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:04.780]   now cold press and i go yo do do do do the cold press first i want to do cold press first or
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:10.780]   coffee industry is very appropriate yeah i'm actually kind of excited about this i i'm gonna
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:16.140]   i don't think i'm gonna get the lumberjacks but i think i'll find a book i'll find a book uh
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:21.260]   there's quite a few books called the lumberjacks some of them are a little more romantic how about
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:28.700]   the lumberjack's bride i might get that instead anyway hmm our love is not meant to be for you
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:35.500]   worry i born lady of lord and i have a rough rough principal lumberjack that's the book
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:42.860]   you've read it obviously gridiron i lived i i lived in leo i won't tell you where there is as
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:47.420]   the lady or is it the lumberjack but this is it was it was a dance man it was a dance this is the one
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:52.220]   about football a football wants to coach as children we don't always understand the hardships
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:27:00.620]   and diversity sets to one and a half i think it won it sounds pretty good for us to live the lives
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:06.220]   we do this particular article was in no way written to suggest that a black player could not
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:11.500]   coach rather it was written to shed i think that sounds like it sounds like a weird a little bit
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:17.020]   of an odd human but it sounds good we are far worse human readers i gotta tell you yeah there's
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:22.140]   some terrible and that's what that's what the standardization often happens like there's
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:27.420]   you know starbucks is not the best uh latte but it's but it's stand expect you know it's better
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:31.900]   than a lot of latte's in other places so so i think that that thing is that it'll set a certain
[01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:38.380]   standard that if you can't afford the the really good i will say that as a mediocre to less than
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:45.020]   mediocre narrator your your job is probably yeah i'm not gonna last much good this is the starbucks
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:49.580]   of audio narration the starbucks of audiobooks basically i like but that's you know that that is
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:53.820]   the common hope through all this conversation we're having about generative ai that if you are
[01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:58.780]   mediocre at a creative job you're in big big trouble yeah yeah that if you're mediocre artists if
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:03.900]   you're showing the art alix that you had up uh before the show started he had a title card so that
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:08.860]   we would know alix was online he's you're mister my accident hold on uh you're mister
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:15.180]   but i i can't even find it we're oh no i have it i have it hold on i had i what happened was i was
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:21.260]   at the airport and i um the airport and someone had taken it had photoshopped themselves in front of
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:26.460]   a tr of triceratops or something had posted on twitter and there was a whole thing about
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:31.260]   yeah jose carolos said well there ought to be conservation uh wherever this is she knew it was
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:36.220]   a triceratops she made a joke that emon makes a joke and then people start getting upset that
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:41.900]   somebody killed a triceratops yeah so so i thought what if there was like a reality show about
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:47.100]   hunting trat hunting dinosaurs you know the you know joe got eaten today and there's a whole
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.420]   bunch of like the inle interviews and and and sometimes the trina the the tranosaurus rex turns
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:56.300]   around so i was chasing you and so i just told mid journey um i think that the what i gave it was
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:29:05.180]   um tranosaurus rex tranosaurus rex chasing after man with rifle and i got that wow 15 seconds
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:09.740]   that's not a you didn't iterate on it that's just the first thing you know that was like it just
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:15.180]   was like okay well i had a couple other ones of man doing this man man mrney is really good
[01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:21.580]   and then yeah when you get it when you get it i get good i guess what mit refers to as uh
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:26.780]   prompt engineering yeah um you you get pretty quick you very quickly get something that's pretty
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:31.020]   impressive if you know what to ask for and what to tell it you know to make that work so i have
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:36.940]   started using a new search engine which i'm going to probably recommend at some point i want to i
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:42.620]   want to keep using it called niva any eva but they're doing something i'm sure google will start
[01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:52.380]   doing when you do a niva search um they give you a summary from a ai like a chat gpt let me let me
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:58.460]   i don't know if niva's turned on here let me see search for mac break oh no let's see something like
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:04.300]   uh replace apple battery it's really good when i search for programming content
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:10.380]   no i'm still using google let me i don't remember how i switch this over i guess i have to switch it
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:15.900]   over here but it's uh so it's really an interesting google apparently is quite nervous about this
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:20.300]   because they have those you know knowledge bars where they just basically take a clip of somebody
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:24.700]   else's website and paste it up there and people are starting to get a little upset about that
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:33.900]   and uh apparently let me change it over to niva here we go so let me um oh i know what i could search
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:41.180]   for let's search for the manhattan distance because i don't know what a manhattan distance is and i
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:47.580]   had to learn that in a programming thing and oh it didn't do it it didn't do it it maybe it's not
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:52.140]   turned on yet i think they might have turned it off because it got slower but this is pretty credible
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:59.020]   results but it was doing a paragraph generated by ai oh i'm not signed in that's why anyway
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:03.420]   i think we're going to see more and more in these kind of in those kind of situations yes
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:11.340]   where it's uh a human couldn't obviously do it but the summaries actually work better in a lot
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:16.460]   of ways with chat gbt then then it generating its own thing it looking at what you're doing and
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:22.140]   pointing it and then condensing it i found it actually to be um very good yeah i wouldn't
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:28.220]   write it i wanted to write any programming code although uh i have seen a number of cases where
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.860]   production code is now being written by chat gbt
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:37.340]   ours had a great article the day about how a lot of script kitties and i were using it to hey
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:42.860]   hey write me some code that will get me through cloud cloud cloudflare uh yeah firewalls like okay
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:47.900]   here we go a lot of it has to do with if somebody's already written that code here we go right
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:54.060]   here's the here now so i logged in so here's the ai generating uh this is ai generated
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:32:00.700]   uh so it's pulling from a number of websites and then doing a summary which i think is very
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:06.780]   interesting yeah very interesting yeah that kind of stuff is super useful the problem is
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:10.060]   integrating into a web search so that you can actually trust the results and that's where
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:15.740]   oddly enough when google is the company who's saying no no we don't want to go so fast that
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:21.580]   we're being irresponsible and misleading people oh boy that's that's a situation what i'm surprised
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:25.980]   that is that no one has built just a web page that uses chat gbt to take anything that you put
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:32.620]   into it and convert it to pirate it it is it actually it chat gbt does pirate really really
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:37.580]   well just in case you're wondering you know the the conversion is very good we've had this technology
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:44.380]   for 20 years Alex we're i'll call you the command line tools i was using in the 90s today uh nieva
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:51.660]   surborn for lumberjack terms lumberjack terms include logger woodcutter shanty boy wood hick
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:59.500]   boompoke boomcat faller bucker timber beast and toothpick timber thank you very much that's a
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:04.540]   ai generated it may be wrong but who cares it's good it's good welcome to the boompoke
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:10.620]   and and and what i said the reason i said pirate is because there have been many things that
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:15.340]   convert to pirate but the the jet gbt takes it to an entirely another level oh really it is
[01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:21.100]   oh not just replacing one word for another it is reforming like i put the gettiesburg address
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:30.140]   you know into gbt and it's you know um uh i mean it all right let me try it i i i i i'm i'm buying
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:34.620]   this hold on i got to log in again to this it's just that i you know we used to do it all the time
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:41.260]   on on you call it a pirate day so you are four scar are in seven years ago are
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:48.460]   i can't let that yeah yeah what was it that uh you know they battled fear of storms hostile
[01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:53.500]   natives and rival crews all in the name of building a new nation do you do you call it the
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:34:02.140]   gettiesburg address in pirate speaker i said what i said was uh i all i said um was you know right
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:06.220]   right to gettiesburg address in pirate that's all i didn't do anything else oh hey mateies
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:11.900]   here be the gettiesburg address as a pirate would give it for scar and seven years ago our
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:17.420]   pirate forefathers brought all this is can see this is not very good mine was much better
[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:21.580]   tested whether that nation or any nation so no it's this whole gettiesburg address with a few
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:26.220]   weird little things no mine didn't do that it's all together fit and proper we should do this
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:30.140]   now this is just a normal maybe it knows me better it knows you it knows you maybe because
[01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:34.300]   we're experiencing is hopefully high demand please hang tight is we're going to scaling our systems
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:40.940]   i mine mine came out really well that's a that's a historical i wonder if i if i search for gettiesburg
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:48.860]   address if i'd get a uh if i'd get a uh a little bit of a rabbit hole aneeva's aneeva's summary
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:57.420]   yeah there you go look at that that's kind of cool it's kind of cool i think these i'm kind of
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:02.380]   liking this new neva thing this is a paid you have to pay for it was going to be my pick
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:08.700]   down the road but i'll mention it now uh you have to pay for it uh five bucks a month but uh there's
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:14.220]   no ads there's no tracking it's a bunch of google ex-googlers including google executives who said
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:18.380]   you know what if we did google and it was a paid google and we didn't have to do any of the ad
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:24.380]   crap um and it works it's actually i've been using it as my main uh chat a main search for about two
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:28.700]   weeks now i'm very happy with it and this ai thing they just added which is fascinating
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:35.980]   anyway hey everybody leo le port here i am the founder and one of the hosts at the twit podcast

[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:14.380]   started advertising with us on day one has been with us ever since he said quote we would not be
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:21.500]   where we are today without the twit network i think the proof is in the pudding advertisers like i.t pro
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:27.580]   tv and audible that have been with us for more than ten years they stick around because their ads
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:33.420]   work and honestly isn't that why you're buying advertising you get a lot with twit we have a

[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:45.900]   still apple conferences there are still apple two conferences this is Kansas Fest in kc it's coming
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:55.020]   up july 18th to the 23rd only 188 days until apple two forever Kansas Fest it's this one guy
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:41:01.740]   no i'm sure it's more than that look there's there's sessions two people's heads in there
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:13.020]   i love it so there are still fanfests everywhere i thought i mentioned that also moving on
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:22.700]   broadcom that's right now the chip that does a lot of the stuff the wi-fi and the bluetooth the
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:30.540]   radio stuff in your iphone according to mark german not only is apple replaced intel they're working
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:36.220]   on swapping out qualcom for their own modem that didn't go so well the last time and a combined
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:45.100]   wi-fi and bluetooth chips bluetooth chip using using the ku-kluzo AI voice mouse
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:54.140]   and the bluetooth chip yes the bluetooth as not my dog
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:42:00.780]   how is your dog by the way is that the dark cover bluetooth my dog is doing great
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:08.620]   big me at me at pail my fin with your dog that my dog pail my phone zet is not my dog
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:25.420]   thank you thank you
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:30.140]   they should own everything that's and so they're like bluetooth wi-fi we can make a chip that does
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:33.820]   that and so they're gonna do that and then if you're broadcom you're like
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:40.540]   um do like but what about us and the answer is that they're it's in this awkward position where
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:44.620]   like they're gonna put it in some products but not others which means that they'll still be a
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:49.900]   broadcom customer and broadcom doesn't really want to lose their business but they know that it's
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:54.460]   gonna go away it's sort of like apple and intel's relationship which is sort of like you know we
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:59.260]   want to make money while we can uh what's funny about this is it's not qualcom right like they have
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:05.420]   not been able to replace qualcom for 5g modems right but they've been able to yeah and apple's been
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:11.500]   doing some of this like the apple chips but in some devices have to play i would imagine pay license
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:15.660]   fees because one of the reasons they use qualcom chips and i bet it's true with broadcom too is
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:20.620]   they own the patents for the underlying technology so they're still gonna pay for that yeah my guess
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:24.460]   is that they feel like if they integrate it into their own systems that they can get savings in
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:29.820]   terms of power especially in efficiency to have it be integrated into their own stuff instead of
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:35.340]   using an off the shelf this is uh from mark german it is according to people oh shut up mark i'm
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:40.780]   talking it's according to he probably could say bluetooth chip better than i can according to people
[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:46.220]   according to people who asked not to be identified because apple's plans are private although i guess
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:54.780]   what mark announced it uh broadcom's stock tanked 4.7 percent because apple is 20 percent of broadcom's
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:44:02.620]   revenue last year seven billion dollars uh qualcom 22 percent 10 billion dollars so qualcom and
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:08.620]   de broadcom taking a hit uh the only thing that uh i can tie in on that is we are sitting now in a
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:15.260]   studio that used to be broadcom's offices and our server our server room in my offices where broad
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:20.300]  com used to have all of its equipment they are no longer in this building at all they moved out all
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:25.020]   of their uh facilities out of this building so yeah and and i think that i think that this i mean
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:31.020]   apple has referred to everything other than their chips as legacy hardware in the past so they are
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:35.580]   definitely planning to i mean i wouldn't be surprised that if someday we get the iphone is just a
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:42.700]   piece of silicon that sits inside inside of the glass you know like ultimately uh it's all one
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:48.220]   system on a chip with everything it could eventually yeah i mean yeah so i mean or they
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:52.620]   or they i think you could you just end up with more and more of it being incorporated into their
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:56.460]   into their system and it allows them to design for that but they have first they'll build it as
[01:44:56.460 --> 01:45:01.900]   as separate pieces because they don't know what they don't know how to do it yet so the first step
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:06.700]   is to take over all of those chips that are there and then the next thing will be a you know a
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:11.180]   system on a chip but it's the entire system it's literally just a piece of silica wafer that just
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:15.180]   goes into the thing and no one's ever been able to do that because no one's been big enough as
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:20.220]   big as apple and and had the you know it controls the software controls the hardware controls
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:26.140]   yeah all those things let's not forget uh last week we talked about Tim Cook at the Sony factory
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:31.820]   in that japan it's making nice with the sony folks for the uh or the camera right sure for now some
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:36.220]   stuff you know like it's it's all you know it's how much and how much does apple want to bite off of
[01:45:36.220 --> 01:45:41.020]   that though all of it uh sensor i think i think apple wants to bite off as much as they'll just
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:44.700]   keep figuring things out and you'll see things slowly keep on getting added to the system
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:49.340]   camera's gonna be tough especially the sensor is really hard so what sony does right they're
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:53.820]   renowned for their sensors yeah but but apple's figuring i mean apple has to work pretty closely
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:57.580]   with them i think it's the patterns that probably keep apple away from the sensor not so much the
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:03.020]   making of it but i think that the um uh the sensors are hard you know and i think that apple's
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:06.860]   probably that'll probably if if something ends up being the last thing it'll probably be the
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:13.180]   sensor i don't know if you notice this is the uh bloomberg story on bloomberg.com and they have a
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:20.220]   picture of a Qualcomm chip in a phone that if you look closely apparently has been broken open or
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:25.980]   of course i don't know what's going on there but maybe burned at the end it's uh
[01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:34.780]   did you did you want that badly to get to the chip i guess is the question and the answer is yes
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:47.100]   um what happened here yeah hmm burn it with fire crime scene calling in spectra cluso immediately
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:51.740]   the photo credit goes to Brent luhin at bloomberg so i think probably mark said hey brent i need
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:58.620]   quick i need a picture of a qualcom modem in an apple phone and brent said here that's from the
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:05.020]   crime scene like a kinder egg uh broadcom's chief executive hawk tan during a conference call
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:11.420]   last month expressed confidence that his company will maintain its foothold at apple we believe we
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:16.540]   have the best technology delivering value to our customers there's no reason to find something
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:22.780]   else where you're not best true that is was apple's experience trying to replace the modem wasn't it
[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:28.860]   yes yeah absolutely but intel's business because intel wanted to get out of it napple is
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:33.980]   not yet produced anything out of it either uh sounds like they're you know still working there but
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:39.020]   it's right so qualcom has said the same things and thus far has been true so we'll see what happens
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:44.700]   with broadcom but i get the feeling that integrating some bluetooth and wifi is going to be easier
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:50.140]   than 5g but then again you know the last thing you want is to say yay we built our own ship and then
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:55.180]   you put it in the laptop and that laptop is notorious wifi problems right because that is not what
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:58.780]   you want to do and you certainly don't want to do that with the iphone and the cellular modem
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:03.980]   which is why i think they're so careful german says that apple's been trying to build a modem
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:11.100]   replacement since 2018 uh apple is ready to ship its first cellular modem chip he says by the end of
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:18.940]   next year or 2025 so it's still a ways off right and there'll be a ramp right it'll be in some it'll
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:23.420]   be in some niche product it'll be in an se or something like that but they're not going to just
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:26.860]   flip over the whole iphone line in a year because that's just too risky if they have a failure
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:30.860]   it's easier to do the broadcom chip though because don't they make their own bluetooth chip the
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:36.140]   w2 in the in their headphones and yeah exactly they've they've done some things that aren't broadcom
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:40.300]   where they're doing bluetooth and wifi so they they have some experience there they just haven't
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:45.660]   brought it into like the mac ipad and iphone where they would just say we're taking this over entirely
[01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:52.940]   yeah they might they might even decide to do sort of ab testing where some factories will get
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:56.940]   one chip the other factors will get the other chip they used to do that with what was the what
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:03.660]   was the model of iphone that had um i had the intel and the qualcom motors that was like the half
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:09.180]   half of the iphone's had qualcom half had modem intel modems and they had to slow down the qualcom
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:13.580]   because the intel was so crappy yeah that all the phones had the actual qualcom
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:18.140]   phones had to be slowed down so they wouldn't be any faster than the intel phone so you wouldn't
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:25.660]   know what you got yeah german also is giving us very bad news about this year's apple releases
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:32.380]   apple he says we'll talk up its mixed reality headset in 2023 but not much else
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:39.340]   and the most interesting part of those of those stories were about how apples he claims that he
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:45.020]   has sources saying that apple is actually pulling engineers off of ios off of macos to get this
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:51.340]   reality headset off the door sometime this year so and consequently we shouldn't expect much of in
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:56.780]   ways of revolutionary new features for either o s this year if this is the if this is the actual
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:01.740]   year for the headset after all these years of people talking about it uh this is going to be
[01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:05.340]   the thing i mean this is going to be the full court they've spent tens of billions of dollars
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:11.020]   that's the real hard so i have this really bad feeling about this this could be a horrible flop
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:19.420]   uh i know you i know you're bullish but i i mean the the i'm nervous about what what makes me
[01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:23.260]   nervous about it leo is that is that we've had reports of it being over two thousand dollars and
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:26.780]   now we've got a report of it being over three thousand dollars thirty five hundred bucks yeah
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:31.820]   and the only way that that makes sense to me is if they truly pitch it as being
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:39.180]   a development preview and corporate tool absolutely and and that jibes with the rumor that it's
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:43.740]   going to be called reality pro because the indication i think they're going to need to say though
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:49.580]   yes we know this is not for everybody that we're working on that one too because nobody's going to
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:55.260]   do i mean this is my question who is going to invest in developing software for a brand new apple
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:51:01.260]   platform that isn't going to sell units right like developers have to feed themselves developers
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:06.140]   have to sell copies of their software in order to make their businesses work and if it's a three
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:11.500]   thousand dollar plus headset you know whoever unless you're a an enterprise software developer
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:17.420]   trying to speak to that that that market of big businesses that are trying to assemble you know
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:23.420]   visualize CAD or or whatever uh you're not going to develop for it and and apple's whole
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:28.140]   game plan since the iphone app store opened has been get the developers in because there's
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:32.620]   going to be a gold rush and there's money to be made but not at three grand or even two grand i
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:37.740]   think according to german apple has already shared the device with a small number of high profile
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:43.500]   software developers for testing letting them get started on third party apps the device is operating
[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:51.100]   system code named borealis inside the company will be publicly named x ros if they have ceded
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:54.380]   developers with it how long before we start hearing more details
[01:51:54.380 --> 01:51:56.220]   i very soon
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:52:04.220]   going home though i will say that right it's like can you send jimmy over you'll see him in may
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:09.580]   he's locked in he's locked into the campus yeah jimmy's office does not face out it faces in
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:13.820]   leaking all it's been leaking all along so i imagine it'll it'll keep leaking i don't know if
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:18.060]   the developers who are being watched like hawks are going to be the source but it'll it'll it'll
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:23.900]   keep leaking i think that's your relationship so i think this will go ahead no i'll let you finish
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:28.700]   i just want to move on a little bit okay just just quickly that i think this will track like most
[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:34.140]   of apple's brand brand new releases in which if they have to have something running at the at the
[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:38.780]   intro uh the intro will happen way before actual release so there's some developers will have some
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.860]   software that is not written by apple that will show what it can actually do and the three thousand
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:47.740]   dollar price tag even more is not a problem so long as as jayson said so long as they define
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:53.180]   that this is not a consumer product this is for a developers who are investigating vr which is one
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:59.020]   of the biggest markets for vr hardware and secondly this is for medicine this is for the military this
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:03.980]   is for architecture this is for design all of the corporate all the vertical markets that are
[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:08.860]   specifically buying vr hits it's like uh uh like a micro sauce right now three thousand dollars is
[01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:12.700]   pretty much about these things cost so so long as they can tamp down expectations long as they
[01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:19.020]   can make sure that the people that they see to these with okay if you write anything anything
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:26.220]   that even smells tiny a little bit like it's a game or it's a navigation app or anything like that
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:31.580]   we will come over there and we will call your dog many many mean spirited names and they will
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:35.260]   be have a hard time coming back from that we are i don't think don't let you think that i don't think
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:37.980]   that's going to be the case though i think there was going to happen as a lot of developers are
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:41.260]   want to get a hold of it and they're thinking two or three years down the road and they're going to go
[01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:44.940]   i'm going to build the next game the next education thing i'm going to build knowing that
[01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:48.540]   eventually i don't think that these headsets are going to get i would be surprised that the
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:52.780]   headset is ever ever less than a thousand dollars like it's you know like i think
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.460]   nine ninety nine is about as close as you're ever gonna be a breakthrough too but it but i think
[01:53:56.460 --> 01:54:03.020]   that that would be very you know and and i mean five years from now it might be a thousand dollars
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:08.460]   it's only some developers are going to be able to work with the hope of giving revenue in two or
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:12.620]   three years right and that's going to be a it's going to be a that would be a very different
[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:17.100]   proposition for apple to make and there and i have to wonder why they're so bullish on this
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:24.620]   given the current evidence that this is a dead end well i i think that i a lot of things have been
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:28.220]   dead ends that apple you know the phone wasn't supposed to work the watch wasn't supposed to work the
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:32.140]   you know like these were all things that everyone said you can't but everybody had phones and used
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:37.020]   the phones everybody has watches and these watches nobody has a VR headset they were around the
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:42.700]   office nobody and i think that i think that you know i i have again there's been a lot of
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:49.340]   uh a lot of support i mean a lot of o_s stuff that's been built out over a very very long time
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:52.940]   for this that's what was missing it's what's been missing for a lot of these things just don't get
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:57.660]   it i don't think anybody wants to wear anything on their head i just don't think so i i think
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:01.020]   i just if it's as precise as spectacles yes but we're that's way off
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:06.300]   it don't just i just think that the mistake that all of us make are thinking about VR AR is about
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:11.580]   putting a headset on it really AR and VR can be about using a phone it can be about wearing your
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:16.940]   buds so long as you have this idea that you have a phone that can basically capture data wherever
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:21.420]   you want to get it projected well that's where we are today i don't think that's what apple's
[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:25.020]   planning on apple is planning i think they're putting on something on your head
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:29.180]   no but because that's that's a part of it too i think that i think they i hope that they are
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:34.700]   putting together an ecosystem where it develops a can do things with phones that that they
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:39.340]   they guess api is for free i guess i'm just so old and i just don't but but but but i do agree
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:42.620]   with you if they're trying to make if they're trying to say oh but we're apple people will buy
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:47.260]   a three thousand dollar AR VR headset people will buy a thousand dollar VR headset in quantity for
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:52.700]   education because we're apple saying no well maybe they've been planning this since 2019 they
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:56:00.700]   plan to release it this month according to german until fairly recently uh they have now
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:05.660]   they've now decided they're going to release it on the wwdc in june i'm told says mark
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:11.020]   they've been planning the release maybe since 2019 they've been planning the headset a lot
[01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:15.340]   longer than that so the you know and so the well they wanted to have it out in 2019 is what he's
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:21.980]   saying yeah so uh what does that mean for the rest of apple's products i mean hit the headline is
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:31.020]   and i hate to say it not much else uh it looks like not a lot of new ipad news at all if any
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:38.380]   uh focusing on the wrong thing right no iMac updates the mac pro will come out the rumors are
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:42.780]   about the macbook pro update first half of the year macbook pro mac mini update with the same
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:47.980]   designs and features says german is the current 14 and 16 just be bumps we can we can stipulate
[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:55.100]   that german's usually right m2 pro and m2 macs marginal leaps from today's macbook pro processors
[01:56:55.100 --> 01:57:01.260]   a high end configuration of the mac pro model with 48 cpu's and 152 graphical cores has been
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:08.860]   canceled instead apple plans to release a version with the ultra yeah uh which he says makes it
[01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:13.500]   unclear why most users would buy it over the cheaper and smaller mac's mac studio which is
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:20.060]   still plenty fast enough for most people the new mac pro will look identical to the 2919
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:25.500]   the 2019 cheese grater the new right new cheese grater if they were going to do a slimline version
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:29.420]   like a half height version which was the room report for a while there it seems like they killed
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:33.180]   that and said let's just use the one we've got and design a new enclosure and i wonder how
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:39.740]   alex you feel about this no user upgradable ram you know that's how you build that that's how
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:44.060]   they're building what they're doing that's these sosies they have unified but what you get with that
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:51.580]   is speed so so so if you're if you're buying into it there's not a i mean two ss storage cards
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:56.780]   uh slots for storage for graphics media networking cards two ssd storage slots
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:58:04.700]   uh getting getting the uh being it you know the ram being on the bus massively
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:10.460]   so i understand just be aware that's why you can upgrade it and which means that the upfront
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:15.100]   cost will be very high if you want more than 64 gigs of ram probably but he does say the graphics
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:19.020]   are upgradable which is interesting because that's a new wrinkle we have and that's what you get
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:24.060]   with the that's what you get with the um the cheese grater is that you have all the built-in
[01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:27.980]   some of the other things that that come with that which is slot but who's going to make a graphics
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:33.340]   card for apple well at i already i'm not at i but amd already makes those graphics things and it'll
[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:36.860]   be interesting to see if apple does something on its own that takes more advantage of it
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:39.900]   you know i think that you know i think i don't i think apple is now that they've been writing
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:43.580]   gpu's think they may be giving you like hey if you want to put four gpu's and we have apple
[01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:49.020]   cards that will be an afterburner like card that does that has a bunch of gpu's on it
[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:54.940]   that are built to work with metals yeah german says much faster don't expect a lot a larger iMac
[01:58:54.940 --> 01:59:02.540]   and iMac pro this year no or for a new or a new iMac they he says he's been pretty consistent that
[01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:08.220]   they're not going to do an iMac update until the m3 so it'll still be that m1 iMac either no the
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:14.860]   only new hardware that really is in his report is that mac pro that we've been waiting for and i
[01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:19.980]   think you know there's talk that the the high-end iphone that we currently think of as a pro max
[01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:25.260]   will be an ultra maybe and have some extra new features and a fancy new camera but like it sounds
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:31.500]   like other than the headset it's a potentially very quiet year for new apple hardware the one thing
[01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:37.820]   that might save them and he says this as well because i think i would buy this and i bet it's
[01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:44.380]   their best-selling model of macbook air a 15 inch macbook air that would be a hot product i think
[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:50.220]   i think i think so and i think uh having a product that's got a bigger screen that's not too grand
[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:55.100]   uh end up from there which is what the mac vu pro is i i think that would be nice i'm just sorry
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:59.580]   that they're still being kind of conservative in their laptop does all their laptop designs it would
[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:06.620]   be nice if the macbook air if they if if apple came out with a mac with an ipad pro form factor
[02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:11.740]   i would be so into that as opposed to a backbook air which is smaller than a macbook pro
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:16.780]   not so much smaller that it would change my lifestyle so it's this it's a pity that they're not
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:21.180]   really trying to push the push the needle on that okay we got to run let me run through these uh
[02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:25.740]   they've been working on larger ipads don't expect them this year there will not be new ipad minis
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:29.820]   there will not be new ipad errors there will not be a new entry level ipad this year
[02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:37.500]   wow uh updates to the 11 and 13 inch ipad pros won't come into the first half of next year
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:43.020]   i will not i don't anticipate an update major changes to apples watch hardware that's fine i
[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:46.620]   just bought one i don't want to do one airpods won't get updates of note in this year
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:53.980]   the maybe a larger home pot i mean this is brim and if it's because apples decided we're
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:01:00.620]   gonna go all in we're pushing and all the chips on a ar vr headset i don't it's also i mean i think
[02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:05.580]   every trip shortage everyone's talking about the economy like i think that if you know i think
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:10.700]   that they're wrong on the economy by the way they're wrong that inflation's going down uh i think
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:17.740]   they're that's a that's a mis that's a mistake to to progress project a bad economy i know people
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:23.340]   believe that but if you look at the numbers uh unemployment's very low uh inflation's going back
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:28.380]   down i think that's a mistake if they're doing that and that's that's not the way that's not the way
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:32.700]   you plan the future anyway you you don't say oh yeah you know the economy's bad numbers gonna
[02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:38.460]   buy anything let's not do anything this year that's not how you build a company that's when you build
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:43.820]   a company and a recession is when you when you start taking you know planning for the future
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:50.780]   yeah you take chances like with the ar vr headset so i think you can only say that's such a mistake
[02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:55.900]   i think i think it's a lull also in part because they were motivated to make big changes because of
[02:01:55.900 --> 02:02:00.380]   the move to apple silicon and so you saw the mac pepro changes we saw so much last year change
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:04.540]   with the m2 over the last couple of years we've really seen that and and there is a little bit
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:08.860]   of a lull here because then you know now they're like okay but we don't need a new mac pepro we just
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:12.540]   did that so they don't need to do that again they just did the i-max so they don't need to do that
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:18.140]   again and there aren't that many products on the mac line that are uh are there the ipad pro is
[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:21.100]   one of those where it looked like we were gonna get something new and instead they just played
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:26.220]   the same song again so and that's an 18-month cycle so now we're gonna wait until next year for that
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:30.540]   so i think that that's going on there was that report we talked about about like last week about
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:36.620]   the gpu in the latest iphone processor actually having to revert to the old gpu cores because of
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:43.340]   a mistake i i keep thinking that that's maybe part of the story about the m3 might not be what we
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:48.060]   think it is and it might be based it might skip a generation and i wonder if that's part of this
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:53.020]   story too is that they look at the apple silicon roadmap for the mac and they've got some designs
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:58.700]   on what the next leap is going to be and it's not now right like and maybe they're delayed a little
[02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:03.100]   bit but i wonder if that's part of it too is like step one was get everything to apple silicon they're
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:08.620]   almost there with that and then and then they will take you know they'll make little pushes with m2
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:15.580]   here and there but really the next big step is with m3 and they're not because of delays i think
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:21.900]   they're not going to take a step into m3 probably until next year and so that's you end up with a
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:29.100]   really quiet ear which is where we are no mac mini this year well there is that rumor that
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:32.860]   they're the high end mac mini that they are going to do that that there'll be an m2 i don't see this
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:37.260]   on german's list yeah i think he's didn't didn't he say that i thought he did it was going to be a
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:41.980]   mac mini update along with the past but this is his up latest newsletter
[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:47.340]   came in January 8th i feel like i think they will because the intel mac mini still on the price
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:50.860]   list and they want to get it out of there so i think they'll be something all right i hope so
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:56.540]   uh what a mistake they're making such a mistake i think but anyway we'll find out i look i can be
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:01.660]   completely wrong save this clip we can run it next year that's best best of the year yeah so leo
[02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:07.100]   when leo is completely wrong about the arvr headset because it's going to be the hottest thing
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:12.460]   ever it is not the next iphone it is not even the next apple socks people will be lining up to pay
[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:16.940]   thirty five hundred dollars yeah it's a bad economy so let's make a product no one can afford
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:21.900]   uh all right we're gonna take i gotta take a break because we got it we're in already
[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:29.340]   encroaching on security now time uh i do want to require you i want to recommend i suggest it's
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:35.660]   not a requirement it's an optional that you take the uh 2023 uh survey because we'd like to know more
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:39.580]   about you we do this once a year it helps us sell advertising so we can tell the
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:43.260]   advertiser we don't want to spy on you so this way you know we could tell the advertisers
[02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:46.620]   yeah there's some there's some there's some people with uh with college education so
[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:52.140]   saying yeah yeah i could tell you exactly how many go to it doesn't matter just go to
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:58.700]   twit.tv/survey23 it'll take you a few minutes answer what you can it is completely optional but
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:03.740]   it is very helpful to us we also use it to decide you know if we're doing the right thing in programming
[02:05:03.740 --> 02:05:07.980]   and so forth it really is very valuable it's the only time of the year we we try to get to know
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:12.300]   you a little bit better and we don't want to do it by imposing on your privacy so it's completely
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:21.260]   voluntary twit.tv/survey23 time for our picks of the week Alex Lindsay kick us off yeah so i have
[02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:25.660]   one that i picked many years ago and i'm gonna re-pick it because it's confusing in the app store
[02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:31.340]   and it's still my favorite clock app so so i'm gonna say what you're looking for is atomic clock
[02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:41.420]   gory timing g-o-r-g-y timing so it's atomic clock it has been around since the beginning there's a
[02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:45.500]   whole bunch of people who copied it and i think it's unfair that they copied it because it's a
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:49.420]   great it's it's got all the little things that we use i use this in production i put i usually
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:55.020]   have a phone or an ipad and i use this one um this atomic clock what is this gorgi what is that
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:06:08.380]   it's a pretty simple app it's a simple app it shows a clock face but it has all the little
[02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:13.100]   features that that i want and you can it's free and you can you know choose to donate i donate
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:16.540]   whatever like i gave them the most amount of money because i use it all the time i use this
[02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:21.420]   thing all the time this is my clock that i usually have on my desk a clock for the apple watch
[02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:30.300]   yeah yeah that's unique finally cool one exactly seconds so so not that i bitter but i finally have
[02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:34.300]   it watch face that does seconds the way i want it because all i wanted was to get something that
[02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:40.300]   would do watch a watch face that did exactly the same thing and this app is so it's really really
[02:06:40.300 --> 02:06:45.900]   good um again it's it's on the watch but i use it on the iphone on the ipad um you know you can put
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:50.380]   it on there and put it up there it it'll let you um do a couple a lot of changes of how the second
[02:06:50.380 --> 02:06:54.540]   start displayed so if you're in production this is the production app for your ios like that's all
[02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:59.740]   i'm saying is that it is the production version of the atomic clock it'll recheck with whatever
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:04.540]   server and it'll give it to you but we use we've been using it for over a decade and i get frustrated
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:08.940]   because when i go to the store i can't i can never find it because i have to there's a whole
[02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:12.940]   bunch of other atomic clocks that came afterwards and you know heck with those guys
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:19.180]   this one is the they should have picked another name i can i it's not really atomic though
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:23.500]   it it checks that it does do a check or whatever but the point is is that i mean
[02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:27.180]   they're all accurate it's the display that i care about you know like the display and being
[02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:31.340]   able to control how i do it it's not saying it's more accurate than any other clock including your
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:35.420]   all their all accurate it does something that i don't know if it does do say something checking
[02:07:35.420 --> 02:07:39.340]   the server i don't know if it is or not i don't really care it's just that when i put it up and i
[02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:44.620]   display it it in it's a john john's letting it jamer v says he's been using it for years he likes it
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:49.740]   yeah it in and and the only reason i'm bringing up as a as a as one is because i i find every time
[02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:55.500]   i install it again on a new phone i go why are there so many and i can't even find it on the list so
[02:07:55.500 --> 02:08:03.180]   you're looking for the the gorgi uh g o r g y timing is the right one to get and which is
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:09.580]   copy lab markus gomer the classic par excellence although it is not free anymore it's a dollar
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:15.260]   ninety nine oh it's at all it's worth every penny yeah i'm two bucks come on if i paid it for if i paid
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:20.860]   twenty bucks for it i'd still be paying you know a penny a month for for how much i use it so i
[02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:26.620]   want to throw in uh a recommendation that came from one of our listeners the great evan cats who's
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:31.020]   a regular correspondent with us he's even been in here in fact i think when we moved didn't
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:36.380]   evan come in and help us wire the studio in our in our new brick house he's a really nice guy
[02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:42.060]   and we he heard us talking last week about weather apps and he said there's one i'm using you didn't
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:46.940]   mention that's really good and i started using it has a very nice widget a lot of details i it's
[02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:52.380]   not using dark skies but it's a lot more like dark skies it's got the weather forecasting uh you
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:09:02.700]   know maps and all that's f o r e c a forecast forecast without the sta and very customizable
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:08.140]   uh evan gave us a great recommendation and it's got all the you know it's got all the uh
[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:15.660]   the the weather map stuff that you you like to see as we see the rain moving in and all that so
[02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:20.220]   he said you know this is for me the dark sky replacement especially because it's so customizable
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:25.500]   and how it looks and it has a it has a really nice uh widget which i use you have a variety of choices
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:33.900]   um on your front page so i'm gonna throw that in f o r e c a uh there's a free version but to get
[02:09:33.900 --> 02:09:38.780]   rid of the ads you might want to pay a couple of bucks i did i don't want to see ads um but i
[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:43.260]   think they did a very nice job so thank you evan for that recommendation andi and not co
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:48.540]   your pick of the week uh quick pick is a book that i came across a couple weeks ago that i'm really
[02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:53.260]   enjoying called algorithms to live algorithms to live by the computer science of human decisions
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:59.500]   by brine christian and tom griffith's uh it's not really a self-help book it's more of a here's how
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:05.340]   here's a way of looking at how brain spurt uh it is written by a sociologist computer scientist
[02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:12.060]   scientist basically talking about uh very very uh concepts of of computer engineering and software
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:16.540]   engineering that might have an application in relevance to how you think about how you make
[02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:20.380]   decisions how you go through life i guess not a self-help book that is not giving you tips or
[02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:24.940]   anything uh and really it's only for people who are nerds to begin with uh for since there's a
[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:30.060]   chapter on sorting like here's how sorting algorithms work and part of it being trying to make the
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:34.540]   point that it's not just that it's sorts a large number number the large amount of numbers it's
[02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:40.220]   how much work is being consumed uh by sorting this list of things and so the relevance to your
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:45.500]   life is that okay well if you've got a hundred variables to to uh to juggle maybe the idea of
[02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:51.100]   deciding which one is most important is uh is uh undermined by the fact you've got so many variables
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:56.060]   the amount of work you're putting into making this decision is not is uh is much much greater than
[02:10:56.060 --> 02:11:02.940]   the the benefit of picking one thing to do that and then the next chapter is about caching uh and
[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:07.820]   it kind of contradicts the idea of putting things in order which is uh the idea that uh it's not
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:13.500]   necessarily you want to put things in a hierarchical order sometimes the last thing you use needs to
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:17.340]   be the handiest because it's probably the next thing you're going to use so the example they use is
[02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:21.820]   that maybe that the person that the the person who basically just like drops when they when they
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:25.660]   get undressed at the end of the day just drops their pants like in the middle of the bedroom
[02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:29.660]   in the middle of the bedroom floor uh maybe they're not being a slob just because they know they're
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:33.100]   gonna have to they're gonna put their pants on again in the morning so it's just right there where
[02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:37.660]   they're gonna need it so maybe actually organizing it and putting it and putting it in the closet
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:41.660]   is actually the least efficient way of doing things so it's it's really an interesting read
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:46.140]   it brings me it brought me right back to uh my first year as a freshman computer science student
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:49.740]   reminding myself of different algorithms that i haven't really played but certainly
[02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:54.940]   but also again it's not full of advice but i if i myself thinking sometimes in the past couple
[02:11:54.940 --> 02:12:00.460]   weeks think you know what maybe i am putting too many variables into this decision if i were to
[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:05.500]   if i were to simply throw out all but the top four and then work on these four variables perhaps i'd
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:09.900]   get a better result than i would would be getting otherwise so very very interesting this would be
[02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:15.820]   a good one for apple to uh have the ai reader read it because i don't think there's an audiobook
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:19.660]   question yes it would be very nice actually there is right but right by the author yep it's so
[02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:24.460]   unaudible okay it's uh i don't see it on the apple store all right nice i wonder what
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:29.500]   okay algorithms to live by the computer science of human decisions brian christian
[02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:36.060]   i will definitely read it although i worry because that as somebody who uses algorithms in actual
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:42.380]   coding i get nervous when i see those apple those very specific things applied to kind of more
[02:12:42.380 --> 02:12:47.340]   soft things oh exactly that's what that's that's that's why that's why i work i don't want to do a
[02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:53.740]   apple start in my mind i really don't and so therefore that's why when when you're when you're
[02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:57.900]   when you're looking when you're picking up picking up people at that a singles bar use the heapsort
[02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:02.940]   algorithm based on yeah it's basically like here's here's the way the brain works here's
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:06.300]   here's things that things that might yeah it might be a good thing to think about in the ways
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:11.500]   that computers work as somebody who all my life has thought of my brain as my my consciousness is
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:15.580]   not inside my brain my brain is this computer that doesn't work properly right to keep
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:20.460]   hacking hacks to make it work properly it was it was a very entertaining read and in some places
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:25.820]   a very very illuminating kori doctor o says it's good i'm gonna read it that's all i have to say
[02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:31.820]   if Andy and gory recommend a book that's that's it and i do thank you by the way for the book on
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:37.580]   the rosetta stuff that's really great it's really been good reading uh mr. Jason sennell has a pick
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:44.060]   i bet i do i'm gonna recommend okay so since i started using computers everybody always says
[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:50.620]   hey you could store your recipes on that computer yes and i have been using recipe apps and
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:55.100]   discarding them since uh there was one called manja that was like a hypercard stack that steve
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:14:02.380]   up still wrote back in the 90s for a while all my master chef master cook probably are the printed
[02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:08.860]   ones out i have got though for the last year plus i have stuck with one and i use it and i love it
[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:16.940]   and it's called mela me la it's by sylvio ritzy who also does the excellent reader rss reader
[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:23.500]   it's available on meck and ios including ipados it has icloud sync for all your recipes so they go
[02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:29.180]   in all the right places it supports rss so if there's a recipe blog you like it will actually let
[02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:34.940]   you subscribe and add those all in and it has a very smart parser it you can open it's got
[02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:39.820]   an in-app browser if you go to any page that's got a recipe on it and you know what i'm talking
[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:44.540]   about there's like two thousand words telling the life story of the person who just wants to give
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:50.060]   you the recipe and it has that in one window and the window next to it in the little pane next to
[02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:56.380]   it it shows you its import of the actual details of the recipe and you can with one tap you import
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:02.700]   it into your library you can add photos you can edit all the items but the parser is really really
[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:07.660]   good and then it all sings and you can share it with other people with uh by their apple id so
[02:15:07.660 --> 02:15:14.300]   like my wife and i are on the same shared mela uh account and library so that we can add our items
[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:20.060]   in um it's five dollar and i purchased i believe for the whole thing and you can try it for free
[02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:27.180]   it is the one for me i really have finally found a recipe uh database that i actually use and i put
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:32.460]   my ipad in the kitchen i was just doing this last night but my ipad in the kitchen follow the rules
[02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:38.460]   and up with dinner at the end of it it was great now can i ask you uh a question yes i use paprika
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:42.620]   and i've used it for years is fully cross-platform and i have it everywhere including the web
[02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:49.660]   can't please you're probably using a music paprika this is an app yeah yeah and it's fine it's i i
[02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:55.580]   i think it's nice i uh something about mela it's beautiful like really nice interface but it is also
[02:15:55.580 --> 02:16:01.340]   an ipad and mac app so if you want a web app or an android app or something i don't think
[02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:06.460]   sylvia ritzy can help you with that it does the same kind of import which i do all the time because
[02:16:06.460 --> 02:16:11.980]   i often see uh recipes online it's actually i want to actually i'm looking at the mela site i want to
[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:18.300]   make this uh chilis and carne he's got a page yeah so i might actually steal this recipe from him
[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:23.420]   40 years later the promise of early personal computers has finally been realized fine yes
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:28.540]   recipe apps are good enough you could actually use them all the time and how hard and easy it is to
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:33.900]   put it in you can put your own in and yeah well yeah well it'll let you take a picture and and
[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:38.860]   scan it in and basically pop it in there which is also amazing right like as well as being really
[02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:43.660]   smart about reading the um the web pages and getting them into the right format that's the for me
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:49.660]   that's one of the killer features is the fact that it's so easy to get things into it um and and
[02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:53.740]   once you because i do that a lot of that like everybody does right it's the geez i want to make
[02:16:53.740 --> 02:16:57.900]   instant pot risotto what's a recipe for that and you search for it and there's a million of them
[02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:02.460]   but i want to grab the one that looks pretty good and just have it in there for reference forever
[02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:07.420]   and this makes me makes it easy for me to do that my my family pretty much but makes almost everything
[02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:12.460]   from scratch at this point i mean all of us cook it's so nice and it's yeah and having a shared one
[02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:17.340]   i'm really interested in the idea that we just keep the recipes that we use all the time um yeah in
[02:17:17.340 --> 02:17:22.140]   one one thing i've been trying to figure out what that is and and Jason just solved it for me
[02:17:22.140 --> 02:17:30.860]   it's mela mela which means it's short for eggplant i don't know what it is i don't know there's also
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:36.300]   a synthesizer i when i was searching for it that's all the same things that melo i got that too

[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:42.300]   a hundred fifteen two hundred monthly volunteers right now working on everything so the chance of
[02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:47.580]   like learning how to do this by doing it you're the king of volunteerism you know how to get people
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:50.620]   to work for you for nothing well i'm not making any money
[02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:55.740]   like no it's fair i'm not saying you know like you said well the key is i'm volunteering to
[02:18:55.740 --> 02:19:01.260]   participate yeah but you're good people are people are learning um and you're gonna get
[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:08.140]   people to do stuff with you john ashley you work for him right yeah yeah you're really good at getting
[02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:14.060]   people to learn from oh you paid him oh whatever yeah you're the boy yeah so it's a really long time
[02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:19.980]   i'm not paying him anymore so it's fair you know it's no i i know okay no you know the the main thing
[02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:24.940]   is is that i you know i i learned by doing like i walked into a radio station said i don't i love
[02:19:24.940 --> 02:19:29.420]   this and and so that's why we built it as a 501 c3 and that's why we did all this and so people
[02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:32.540]   could volunteer and so the people have the opportunity what i'm trying to do is provide the
[02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:36.700]   opportunity without feeling like you have to go to like how do you get work work training how you
[02:19:36.700 --> 02:19:41.740]   get work opportunity if if no one you know it's just it's just hard to get into the industry because
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:45.340]   it's great you got to find somewhere so we're trying to provide both answering people's questions but
[02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:49.820]   there's an opportunity to to actually learn how all this stuff works and meet other people and you
