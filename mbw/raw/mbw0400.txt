[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.500]   And you know if Merlin's here, we're going to talk a lot more
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.200]   about comics than the brand new Macbook airs,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.000]   but we'll get both in next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Netcast, you love from people you trust.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   the Macintosh, an Apple, an iPad, an iPod, an iPhone news.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   A lot of iPod news lately.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And this is a very special Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I want to welcome you to our 400th episode.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   We started Mac Break Weekly in the fall of 2006.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   -Holy smokes.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   -Leopard was just coming out.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   The iPhone wasn't out yet.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We were still talking about iPod stuff.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   This is the guy who started Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   You started Mac Break Video.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   -That's right.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   -And for some reason, we decided to spin out a audio.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I think it was your idea.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Credit to you.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   You chose the fabulous James Addiction theme.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   James Addiction like theme.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   -Like.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   -Not exactly.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   A lot of notes that aren't connected.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   -So anyway, but yeah, very, very similar.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   But yeah, it was Mac Break Minute was the very first thing in 2005
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   in the fall of 2005, and we did a couple of those,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and you can probably go back and find some of them.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And then Mac Break Video, where we did you and I,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   and Amber and Emory.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   -And then around Segue, it would come on a lot.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   -The video is all through the spring,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and then we talked about doing an audio version,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   which I think made a lot of sense because it was much more of a discussion.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   The idea was long form.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   -You don't really want to watch.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   -I guess now we think you want to watch.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   But back then, the bandwidth was very expensive.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The only reason it even survived was because of Cashflow.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   -You can go back.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   -Yeah, thank you, Cashflow.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   You can go back and watch every, or listen to the,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I don't know when we started video, but listen to the,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   this is Mac Break Video 1, and it's easy to do,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   twit.tv/MBW episode numbers.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So the first one is MBW 1, MBW 2.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I wasn't even on the show for the first six episodes.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I think it was on vacation or something.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   -But you can hear Scott Bourne get all excited about the first iPhone,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   and you can hear this guy make us all just real in stitches.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   The creator of the rat hole, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Merlin Mann.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Do I still say of 43 folders?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   -Sure.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   This is an honor to be here, you guys.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You all look so handsome.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   -Oh, Merlin, it's so great to see you.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We miss you so much.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   -Thank you.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   -So, Merlin Mann.com, you've actually become a professional podcaster.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   -Yeah, I mean, yeah, I suppose so.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's like being a professional juggler or ventriloquist.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I mean, you find work from time to time.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   -You do back to work on the 5x5 network with Dan?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   -Yeah, and Roderick on the line with John Roderick,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and a lot of guest appearances.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   -Well, it's so great to see you again.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   -Thanks, Dan.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   -I just tweeted you.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   -Great last minute thing.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I appreciate you having me.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   -It was very last minute.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   We miss you so much.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   -What are my professional wig, if I'd know?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   -Yeah, I miss the days.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Merlin used to have an office in our office, but it was outlined.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It was outlined with tape.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It was like a tape--
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   -Like a tape nest.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   -Like a tape nest.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   -That's nestment.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   -That's great.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   -I don't think I have the rat hole music that you created for us way back when.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   -I can get my guitar if that'll help.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   -Andy Anaco is also here from the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   When did you join Mac Break with you?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Very early on, right?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   -I think it was 2007?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   My first appearance might have been 2006, 2007.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I don't think I joined regularly until I think Bush was still president, because I remember
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   being a lot less happy about the president back when we started.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I think that came through in the podcast and I regret that.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   -Chris Breen was on a fairly regular basis, Scott Borne, of course.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I've messaged Scott, haven't heard from him.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   He's got his own thing.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   But the newest Mac Break weekly member just joined us about a year ago.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   How long has it been now?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Renee Ritchie, iMour.com.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   -Yeah, about a year, 16 months, maybe?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I feel like a baby Leo.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Someone my age feeling like a baby, you guys.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   -Awesome.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   -You've been doing this show since 2006?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Eight years!
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Hard to believe.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   -It's amazing.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   -400 episodes.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And the Mac is pretty much exactly the same.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   My Mac Pro looks exactly the same.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   -[laughter]
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   -No, there've been a few updates, a few changes.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   The iPod is gone.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   -The phone is here.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   -The phone is here.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We talked for weeks about it.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   -We were still using Trios.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   -I was listening to Mac Break weekly 24, which was the last one we did before the iPhone was announced in 2007.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And in all the speculation, I said what was saying with authority.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I've heard it on authority.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   There'll be no "I" in the name.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   -[laughter]
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   -Come authorities.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   -It's funny here, Apple rumors in retrospect, because now you really realize how wrong they so often are.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   -Do you think that someday maybe the Apple key on the keyboard will become officially a control?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   -[laughter]
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   -Rumer has it, Apple's considering dropping the Apple desktop bus.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   -Was that a rumor?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Because that happened.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   -Probably nobody gets that one happen.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   -No, my favorite time displacement sort of rumor was when I think we did have a discussion about how long is it going to take for Apple to adopt USB 3?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   -[laughter]
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   -When you don't have iOS, you have less interesting things to talk about.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   -In fact, did they?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   -Yes, I guess I have it on the macro.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   -Yeah, okay.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   -Whew.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   -Had to wait for on-chip support for that.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   -That's right.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   -I guess.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I think that's a very, very signature sort of thing where if you say, "Well, Apple, what if we put USB 3 support on the CPUs you've already agreed to put on there?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Will you agree not to put in extra hardware to turn that into USB 2?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Or do you agree to have something that is kind of almost as good as firewire and lightning?"
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Thunderbolt.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   -Mirland, what else have you been up to since we last gabbed?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   -You know, sitting here thinking about it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   -Do you still do?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   You look nice today?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   -I don't think so.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   -You could always re-emerge.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   -There's one more episode hanging out there somewhere, I think.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   -You guys are burning one?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   -I don't got busy.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   -And I've never put it out.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   -Well, you know, it's the long now, as Brian Eno says.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   -You should keep it and then have it released on your desk.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   -Oh, that would be great.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   If I ever get a will, I'll do that.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   -Like Mark Twain's biography.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   -Here's even better.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   You should record it and then bury it in a landfill somewhere.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   -And then 15 years later, get someone to do a documentary where they dig it up.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   -I'm still stuck in it.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   -You make 20,000 copies of it.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   -It's funny.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I still love doing the show.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And I remember always trying to introduce talking about apps.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And I guess my two things that I think of when I really think back to the early days was Scott
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Borne going on and on and on about the Apple phone.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   He felt inevitably going to come out.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   He started a podcast of memory service called the Apple phone show.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   -You didn't remember that.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   -It's so strange now how much, I guess if there's one thing that's changed tremendously since then,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   there's how much I use iOS devices for so many different things.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   -Well, I include comics.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Am I right guys?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Comics?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   -Hey, what happened?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   -So, comicsology got sold to Amazon, right?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   -He just did a whole back to work about this.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   -And it seems like there's some upset involved.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Now, I'm not a comic book fan, so I don't understand.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   -It's a stoshive upset.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   -What's the upset?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Are they killing comics?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Is that it?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   It's over?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   No more comics?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   -Well, I don't know.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   -If you pay attention to what they're saying, yes, but I don't think so.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   But I'm sorry, Muriel, go ahead.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   -This is their contention.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   People get emotional about stuff.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.640]   It's basically Amazon acquired comicsology and within a couple weeks of acquiring them,
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.600]   they released a new version of the app that will not allow in-app purchases.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.680]   And for most of us, that's how we get comics is going in and Wednesday morning, my daughter
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.600]   climbs into bed, we go and see any new adventure time available and you click and you buy
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.840]   it in the app.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.680]   And so, to me, the interesting thing about comicsology, and we talked about the set length
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.160]   today on the other show, is how many different things comicsology really does.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.200]   I mean, yes, they're a retailer.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.600]   They're the primary retailer of digital comics for a lot of big publishers, but they also
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.080]   make the comicsology app, one version of which now does not allow in-app purchases.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.720]   But they also, correct me if I'm wrong, guys, but they do a white label version of the comicsology
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.680]   app for Marvel, for DC, I think.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.120]   I think Dark Horse has their own, but most of them use the comicsology app, which still
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.080]   does have in-app purchases, and they have a relationship with Marvel, where you can hook
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.680]   your Marvel account up to your comicsology account, so that you can enter in your digital
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.200]   code off your hard copy and get the free digital copy on a premium one.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.720]   So I think it's going to be very interesting to see if, I guess what I'll say is, yes,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.680]   it's a huge bummer, because it's so much easier to buy it inside the app, but it's going
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.000]   to be interesting to see what people like Marvel have to say about it, because I think
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   it's going to--
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.080]   People are outraged that they can't make impulse purchases.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   Damn you!
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.080]   It's an experience, yeah.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.560]   They move the chiclets all the way to the back of the store.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.280]   Also, when you consider there are a lot of people who are writing long and really impassioned
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.000]   essays about how they're breaking the comics' reading experience, and at which point there's
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.560]   a longer piece of the Sun Time that's going to run tomorrow about this whole thing.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.640]   But I have to raise my hand and say, yeah, but remember, historically, before comicsology,
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.720]   if you went into the comic book shop, took something off the shelf, read it from cover
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.320]   to cover, and then moved on to that, they would tell you this is not a library move on.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.880]   This is based on the add to cart mentality.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.120]   Comicsology just broke you of that habit.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.920]   So it does-- Merlin's writing.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.400]   There's such an impassioned community of people out there, and I think that comicsology
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.000]   was represented something more than simply an online store.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.160]   It was really-- you build this lifelong relationship with a specific bricks and mortar retailer,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.720]   this is the place you go every Wednesday and you will see the same clerks every single
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.880]   week, you might see a lot of the same customers every single week.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.160]   And I think that one of the comicsology successes is that they managed to transfer a lot of that
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.760]   affection and a lot of that romantic connection to their site.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.400]   So as soon as you feel as though that covenant has been broken in some way, coupled with
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.600]   the fear that Amazon was going to completely ruin comicsology by acquiring it, that's when
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.200]   the same people who are upset that there is somebody who is wearing the Nova armor, who
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.000]   clearly is not Nova because you can't have the new kid.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.960]   You have to have the Richard Ryder, or whoever it was in that armor.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.840]   That's the same sort of engine that this sort of outrage is connected up to.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.720]   Can you blame Apple for their-- I mean, this is what Amazon did with the Kindle app and
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.320]   the Audible app as well.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.000]   They don't want to give Apple their 30%.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.720]   They also did it with the Marvel Unlimited app as well.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.560]   Marvel Unlimited app, if you sign up on the Marvel Unlimited website, you can get all
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.480]   you can access to comics for your device, but there's no indication inside as with the
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.480]   Kindle app.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.080]   I think by the terms of the iTunes store, there's no indication of how you would even
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.280]   sign up for that.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.760]   But just to remain to the Apple point here though, Andy, you probably know this better
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.720]   than I do, but I think I read something that said comicsology is the biggest grossing
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.560]   non-game app in the app store.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   Wow.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.800]   That's been part of their talk for the past year or so.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.760]   They've had really, really exceptional success, especially with the Apple past year.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.440]   It's not just about that 30 cents per dollar.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.000]   Also remember that I think I'm not criticizing the Apple iTunes store because it is so good
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.400]   for so many people.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.440]   For comicsology, it's not necessarily the best solution anymore because it means that
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.400]   they can't do certain kinds of promotions.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.640]   They can't do things that require a shopping cart like being able to say what Amazon does
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.200]   to say, "Oh, if you bought this, this, and this, it doesn't matter what specific ones
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.200]   you bought, we're also going to give you credit for more stuff."
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.200]   They couldn't do subscriptions within that.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.840]   So that's something you already had to go to the comicsology website in order to buy.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.840]   Sensorship is too strong a word, but every single thing that the comicsology put on for
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   sale through the comicsology app on iOS had to be approved by Apple.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.800]   I don't think that's too strong a word, Apple.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.080]   Well, well, that's a political...
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   Well, that means that all Apple...
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.480]   Sensorship is too strong a word because all Apple wants to do is to keep this in all ages
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.480]   sort of experience.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   Sure.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.800]   But that does mean that number one, it's possible for books to be delayed while page after page
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.840]   of this stuff has to be screened because you can't do a keyword search for a picture of
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.440]   a grand ecological area.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.080]   And also it means that there's some stuff that you could only get by going through the
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.000]   comicsology website directly.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.040]   I just think that it comes down to...
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   Apple was not...
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.000]   That comicsology was not getting enough for that 30 cents on the dollar that they would
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.760]   like and they see a lot of upside, including getting 30 cents more on the dollar.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.560]   But I don't think it's as simple as...
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.120]   It's a good speed bump too.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   Yeah, it's a very good point.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   Renee, you were saying something.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.120]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.640]   There's a lot to decompress from this too because it's not entirely clear that they wouldn't
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.200]   have done this if they hadn't gone to Amazon.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.880]   I know the knee-jerk reaction is to blame Amazon, but this could very well have been their
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   plan because...
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880]   Isn't it ready in a month?
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.400]   It sounds to me like they must have been working on it.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.400]   And the App Store...
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.680]   I mean, the App Store is not set up to have multiple middlemen.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.440]   You have to give 30% to Apple and when you're a middleman to begin with, that's why Netflix,
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.080]   that's why Marvel Unlimited, that's why Kindle, they don't do that because they already themselves
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.240]   a middleman and that's...
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.760]   It's not enough margin to divide up.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.760]   And the other thing that...
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.480]   And to raise Andy's point, there is editorial control, but it's not even handed.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.560]   For example, iBooks often got comics that comicsology had a lot more trouble pushing
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.520]   through because Apple has historically been far more lenient with the iTunes side of their
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.240]   business than they have with their App Store side of their business.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.320]   And all of this adds up to be a lot of frustration for comicsology.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.080]   And while I do think that they're making...
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.240]   It's a very good decision for comicsology.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.840]   You were getting for that 30% a tremendous in-app browsing, impulse buying, and commerce
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.680]   experience from Apple.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.640]   And that's the sad thing that we lose here.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.360]   And yes, you can go to iBooks and still buy with in-app purchases, but the interface
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.640]   is nowhere nearly as good as comicsology's interface.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.960]   So it's kind of both win and lose for everybody involved.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.800]   There are comicsologies at iOS only.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.120]   No, it's Android as well.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.960]   You can do in-app purchasing through Android.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.560]   They switch from...
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.040]   They're using their own transaction.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.640]   Although they didn't take that out of the Android version.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.080]   No, because they didn't have to.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.920]   They could still do in-app purchasing.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.160]   Google has a lot fewer restrictions on what you can do.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.920]   If you're going to do payments through Google Payments, then there are restrictions that
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.480]   are very similar to iTunes.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.040]   If you're going to use your own trans actor, they really almost don't care.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.040]   So I understand...
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.040]   I mean, really...
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.280]   I understand Merlin, you're saying I'm lying in bed with Lily, I want to have a comic.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.240]   And so if I understand the user's upset, because this is like taking a feature out,
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   but I also...
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.480]   It kind of makes sense that this was a...
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.720]   Especially the content limitation.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   This was a big...
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.120]   I think there's a lot of the content censorship or the content issues.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.480]   Once the emotional heat dies down has turned out to be self-censorship.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.520]   I think in the case, I think in one prominent case with...
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.400]   I think it might have been sex criminals.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   No, it was probably...
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   Saga, the image comic.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.840]   We're surrounded by comic books fans.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   Alex, you and I are...
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   Well, there you go.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.680]   I didn't know what you were actually...
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.680]   Sex criminals was actually...
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   Sex criminals?
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.760]   According to Matt Fraction, the author, that was actually banned by...
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.600]   Or excuse me, refused by Apple.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:59.360]   Saga was... I believe it turned out that some middleman was concerned that Apple was going
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.120]   to shut it down, and that's why it wasn't available immediately.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.920]   It wasn't necessarily that they had been anated immediately, but it was more like Apple's
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.840]   sometimes so vague about what they will allow and what they will not allow, that it causes
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.160]   a lot of confusion and a lot of people to be very, very timid about what they do.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:21.240]   The thing is, I don't want to try to diminish people's frustration or to discount it, because
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.520]   it's frustrating for me too, but the truth is it's not in practical terms, it's not that
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.280]   hard to go to the comicsology site and buy it.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.000]   But I mean, the part that interests me is, again, downstream what this means with these
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.320]   other companies, where like I say, with Marvel's app, you can still go in and buy your Marvel
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   comics on there.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.320]   But how many people...
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.400]   I just said on the back to work today, like, I really love the Adventure Time comics, but
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.440]   I'm very unlikely to go down.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.680]   If you're new to comics, I think people are very unlikely to go get a white-labeled version
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.320]   for a specific publisher and download it.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.560]   So all of those, The Rising Tide, kind of raised all of those boats.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.240]   And we'll have that.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.000]   Do we think that we're just going to end up where you're just going to Amazon.com and
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   buying the comic there?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Like you would buy a book.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I doubt it.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.600]   It's a totally different reading experience.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.000]   Also, if we have the history of Audible.com, another Amazon acquisition to fall back on,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.760]   what happens is that if you look for a book and it's also available on Audible, there's
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.880]   also a way to make that purchase through the site.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:25.520]   But Audible.com still exists, not as a little fledgling HTML 2.0 site.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.040]   It's still completely there.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.800]   So where, supposedly, as the comicsology and Amazon were talking about the acquisition
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.280]   a few weeks ago, they were saying that this is still early.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.720]   They haven't really discussed a lot of the opportunities they have for integration.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   I'm looking forward.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.760]   I do believe that it's inevitable that they will start taking Amazon payments to comics
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.760]  ology.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.160]   I do think it's inevitable that if you do a search on Amazon for comic books, there will
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.200]   be just like Audible.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.480]   Here is a way to get you to the comicsology site to make a purchase there.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:59.120]   It's going to take a few months for comicsology to really get used to itself as a subsidiary
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.400]   of a larger company that a lot of people think has too much power because they were the heads
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.760]   of this big community of nerds that had given them their faith.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.640]   And some of those nerds have, nerds, I am one, I'm using that term affectionately.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.200]   And some of those people feel as though that faith has been trampled on.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.080]   And that's why you see a lot of people saying, "Well, I'm not using comicsology again."
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.680]   And why some people who have done some really great work in comics have said, "No, here's
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.760]   how Amazon has done to destroy comics in general."
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.200]   So let's come back in a month and see if these people are still feel that way or are
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.120]   still not using comicsology.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.120]   And then we'll figure out what's going on for you.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.560]   You know how Amazon could make a lot of friends.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.560]   Free comics.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.720]   Everybody, five free comic book days Saturday.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:49.520]   They did have a ton of free comics in comicsology and say, "You're right, we're sorry.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.320]   Here have some free comics."
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.800]   They gave everybody a $5 credit.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.400]   So everybody got found in the $5.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   I want more free comics.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.480]   There's two other things to consider.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.280]   One is that with the new model, some creators are saying they're seeing more money.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.560]   I don't know if your average Marvel artist or writer is, but independent creators are
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.160]   saying they're seeing more money because the Apple cut was, according to Moises' true
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.480]   line at least, was being taken off the top, off the gross.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.800]   But the other thing from Apple's perspective, my understanding is that when they started
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.920]   doing IAPs and subscriptions, their concern was that everybody would switch to free apps
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.520]   and do subscriptions and IAPs as a way to monetize if Apple was not involved in those.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.520]   What's an IEP?
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520]   And I know I'm a producer.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.520]   Sorry.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520]   IAP.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.200]   So if they suddenly just allowed you to do your own in-app purchase and your own subscriptions,
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.880]   it could connect to them from inside the app.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.720]   It would be very tempting for a lot of developers to not give Apple their 30% cut at all, put
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.560]   the app up and have a big subscribe button that goes to the web or a big purchase button
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.360]   saying enable all features or whatever and go to the web.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:52.480]   Then Apple would be handling all the hosting, the delivery, the transactions, all of those
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.720]   things and not have any of the revenue.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.000]   So I think that they've been incredibly protective with that, but I think also Google Play and
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.760]   Microsoft have shown that there is more ways to handle that problem.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.120]   We welcome you to the 400th episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.120]   We haven't even talked about Apple.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.240]   Well, I guess we have because this is really an Apple issue for companies.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.840]   And it is a little bit about the future of the iTunes store.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.120]   I mean, there's a crack in the facade a little bit.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.360]   Well, it just shows that there, I think that any provider who does not on a quarterly basis
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.480]   look at that 30 cents out of a dollar and continually ask themselves, is this a good investment
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.480]   for us and maybe consider pulling out of that, then you're dumb and you're not dumb to use
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.480]   the Apple store.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:38.200]   If you look at the pie chart of where your net goes and one wedge of it is 30%, you have
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.840]   to always be looking at that to see, do we need this wedge of it or can we split this
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.240]   up into other features and suddenly get 18 cents more back or 20 cents more back.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.000]   So I think that there are too many people who have been looking for villains in this,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.880]   either Amazon, Comicsology or Apple, when this really is just 30 cents out of a dollar,
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.480]   am I getting 30 cents worth of value?
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480]   Yes, great.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480]   I'm getting it.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   No.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.480]   Okay.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.480]   Can I forward to drop it?
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.480]   Yes.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   Great.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   Let's do that then.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.480]   Every time we talk about this, it reminds me that I should read more comic books, not comic
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   books, graphic.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.520]   I really like graphic novels and every time I pick, but I go to the bookstore and get
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.720]   them.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.000]   I'd love to mouse the Dark Knight.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.480]   I've read some great graphic novels, 300.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.120]   I like Frank Miller a lot.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.120]   So was this a good platform for that kind of stuff as well?
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.720]   Yeah, perfect.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.760]   There's so many things that Comicsology have done almost flawlessly.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.560]   One of them is the way they've created this really, really great reader app so that if
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:50.200]   you want to, I mean, they came out well before the iPad, but man, this was poised to absolutely
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.760]   not only benefit from the iPad, but to benefit the iPad.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.520]   So you can watch it as a full screen thing.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.880]   You can watch your panel for panel.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.480]   They have actual artists in Comicsology who are manipulating those camera moves to make
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:07.240]   sure they actually make sense, but then they went to, well, let's go to Ultra HD content.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.920]   So if you are, if you got the right kind of artist, not someone who's doing like, you
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.720]   know, Scooby the Scooby-Doo comic, I'm talking about these artists like Amanda Connor, who
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.040]   in the background covered by shadow, there is a makeup table that's not even part of the
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   story, but she is considered every object she wanted to put on that makeup table.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.360]   And it's almost impossible to see an apprended comic, but on Comicsology, you zoom, zoom,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.040]   zoom, zoom, zoom, and say, oh, she's got a necklace made out of Apple C's just like
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.520]   somebody 1968 might have had.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   That's interesting.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   Right.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.240]   So anyway, it's a high-end experience.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.840]   That's why I think most people were really concerned about Amazon because of the first purchase
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:52.000]   because Amazon Comics purchased from Amazon that are mastered as Kindle documents.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Absolutely.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.760]   Thank they're terrible.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:00.560]   I bought my favorite graphic novels last year's graphic novel by Lucy Kincincy called
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.560]   Relish.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.200]   And of course, I bought it as a digital comic wasn't available on Comixology.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.920]   And it was so bad that I went back to Amazon and ordered the paperback because I just almost
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   found it unreadable as a Kindle.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.720]   Should Apple have bought Comixology instead?
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.680]   Would we have been happier?
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.240]   They would never say goodbye to Android sales.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.520]   They would never have allowed that.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.040]   And goodbye to anything remotely controversial.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.040]   Exactly.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.040]   That would have been...
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.440]   Well, if they had made Comixology into the provider of iBooks content, maybe.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:37.080]   But the thing is, I don't think that Comixology would have agreed to a deal from Apple because
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.800]   they really do feel as though they have a mission not just to be a profitable business,
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.200]   but also they're part of their business plan is we want to put comics in the hands of more
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   people.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.160]   That's why there's practically no major platform that doesn't have a Comixology reader.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.320]   And that's why if you buy a comic three years ago, it will still run in whatever...
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.840]   You will be able to review it on any device you have right now.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.280]   I'm surprised to find actually I've bought 800 comics through Comixology for about three
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.280]   or four years.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.280]   Oh, holy cow.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.800]   Well, because I soon like...
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.520]   It supplanted all of my paper comic reading because this is just a superior experience.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.800]   Also, I moved away from my old neighborhood that had one of the greatest Comix shops in
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:21.120]   New England, the Outer Limits in Wallfam, asked for Steve, "Radus shop in the world."
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:26.360]   And there's another Comix shop that's almost within walking distance of my house, but it's
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.520]   terrible.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.680]   It's like, it's dark and they don't carry you soggy or jimbo when I ask, "Well, why don't
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   you carry that?"
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   So I'll know and order it.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   So what if I ordered it?
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.000]   It's not worth my time to order just one copy.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.520]   And he just doesn't want to be distracted from his World of Warcraft campaign in the
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.520]   back of the room.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.440]   It's like, "Oh, come on."
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.880]   If these are the shops that are going to be driven out of business by digital comics,
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.880]   bye-bye.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.880]   Bye-bye.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.120]   So I'm just going to go on Amazon and I'm going to reward them by buying the 10 volume
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.720]   slip case set of Neil Gaiman's Sandman in Half-Life.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.720]   Fantastic.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   I know.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.720]   One of the greats, right?
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   Yep.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   Merlin Man.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.800]   What do you read Lilly at night?
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   Not the Sandman.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   Yes.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   Ellie and I are reading...
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   I'm sorry, Ellie.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   Not Lilly.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.800]   Why do I call her Lilly?
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.800]   Ellie.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.240]   Oh, we had Lilly for a while, but she wasn't working on it.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.120]   Lilly, 2.0.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.540]   She was a little needy.
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.540]   So out the door.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.540]   We've been reading...
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.440]   Well, I'm happy to suggest some one.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.280]   That's why you don't cut the tags off your baby when you bring them home from the hospital.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   No.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.400]   You can return them if they're still in good condition.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.680]   Keep the receipt, do the tag.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.920]   But then if you're going to drop old people off in an emergency room, definitely cut the
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   tags out of their clothes.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.920]   Damn, you don't.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.160]   That's beginner stuff.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.960]   For kids' stuff, I'm reading with kids my daughter, Six.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.640]   I've exposed her to a lot of really inappropriate stuff.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.360]   But for kids' stuff, we really like the Adventure Time comics based on the TV show, but very
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.000]   much expanding on that universe.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.280]   Those are really fun.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.520]   Things like the recently discontinued Superman family adventures, I always really recommend
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.520]   for people.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.080]   Z to the Space Girl is really good.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.400]   I would say a great Marvel series by Scottie Young.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.680]   The Oz books is fantastic.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   Highly recommended.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.600]   There's a lot of really good stuff out there.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.720]   I think Sandman's appropriate for an 11-year-old, right?
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   Yeah, no.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   Can I get her a watchman?
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   Watch that.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   Alright.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.720]   Anything by Warren Ellis.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   She loves Transmetropolitan.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   Oh, very sophisticated.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   Well, Clay.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   Well, Clay.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.880]   Alan Moore, after he went slightly insane.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   That's just...
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:42.120]   I understand he's revisiting classic characters like Alice in Wonderland and Oh, It's Perfect
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   for Children.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   One of this...
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   No, it isn't.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   I'm joking.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   Do not do this.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.720]   One of my few regrets over the end of the screen savers.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.920]   We had, as we do here, a wall in the back where we'd have people sign.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.320]   Actually, they signed the set coming to think it was the back of the set.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   We had Neil Gaiman on it.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.400]   He not only signed it, but he drew a Sandman.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.040]   You know, he was beautiful.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.040]   And it's gone.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.480]   He was back at the set where they took it down and not probably burned it.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.480]   I don't know what they did with it.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   It's very sad.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.480]   If anybody owns that...
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.480]   Talk to me.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.480]   Talk to me, please.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.120]   100 bucks.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.360]   Right here, waiting for you.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   Merlin Mann is back.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, celebrating our 400th anniversary of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   Andy Inaco here.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.120]   Renee Ritchie, Alex Lindsey.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.840]   Alex has set up for the second week in a row our question system.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.840]   Yep.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.240]   So tell us how we get involved in that.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.120]   So you go to bitlybit.ly/mbw400.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.600]   And if you go there, you will see people asking questions.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.600]   Don't worry about the registration.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   You can put anything in.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   I mean, I think you can put it in anything.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   Make it up.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   Make it up whatever you want.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.520]   You can actually watch there as well, which is kind of nice.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.840]   So you can watch the video there.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.440]   But what you can also do is, of course, ask questions.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.560]   And I haven't answered any yet, but ask questions and vote on them.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.320]   And so we'll be going through some of the most popular ones.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.560]   And we can answer them some online.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.600]   And I can also-- I'll answer some of them offline.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.680]   So you can do kind of a little bit of both.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.920]   And it kind of gives you a way to interact with the show.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.760]   And definitely also post suggestions and so on and so forth.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.920]   This is something that we've been using internally for a bunch of stuff.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.720]   And now we're starting to make it more more publicly.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.520]   You very graciously have offered it to TNT to Mike for you
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.360]   string the news show, which we will do.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   Yes.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.800]   I think we're going to use it more often.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.680]   And we're happy to have it on as many of whatever we need to do
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.000]   to get the guy like this idea.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   I'm not going to contest it.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.400]   We're just trying to bang on it.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   We had a lot of--
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.600]   Do you want to let you to add?
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   What would you like to say?
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.920]   Video.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.680]   Video questions.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.680]   Yes.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.440]   Oh.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.800]   That's just turning on the flash camera and adding it as a content.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.720]   Let me talk to--
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.920]   Because if you could do that, that would be for a show like this
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.040]   to have audio and video of the questioner.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.160]   I think it would be great.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.120]   You'd have to keep the video and audio short.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.920]   But the hard part is someone watching a video
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.000]   and then watching other videos and so on and so forth.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.680]   But it's a good idea.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.800]   I'll take a look at that.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.880]   We've used that in the past.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.720]   But mostly, we've had people do it on YouTube.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   Because YouTube has a great platform for that.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.920]   So we might go to do something where
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.840]   you could do it there and then post it.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.200]   I'd love to use it in triangulation,
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.880]   somebody said in the chat room, right?
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.080]   Patrick, that would be great.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   And then API so we could put it in our apps.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.080]   Because I'm starting to think mobile is where we need to go.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.440]   And you know how genius C-Dig 4 was my idea.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:20.960]   So--
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.680]   Way of the future.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.320]   Way of the future.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.520]   I'm the product guy.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.480]   Way of the future.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.880]   Wave it someday everything will be mobile.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.360]   But yeah, this is very, very modular.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.420]   So all of that stuff is possible.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.420]   Do you want to ask a couple of the questions?
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.320]   No, I'm going to take a break but after that,
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.400]   we'll come back with some questions.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.640]   And by the way, there's new Mac books.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.480]   What?
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.560]   You want to talk about that?
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.100]   All right, Mac, we're inirtigal, what?
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.260]   And a Star Wars cast.
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:48.780]   And?
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.280]   Yes.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.000]   A cast for Star Wars.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.860]   Oh, boy.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.360]   Wow.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.100]   I love that photo of all that.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.740]   And does that have anything to do with that picture
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:56.580]   of shoulder there?
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.860]   You bet it does.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.120]   I think that's R2D2.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.420]   And I think that's Harrison Ford.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.780]   I think that's Carrie Fisher.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.440]   And I think that's some dude who played loose Skywalker.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.340]   I'm not sure if he voiced it in the cartoon,
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.040]   but it might have been the guy who played play.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.760]   Oh, I'm sorry, or maybe that's the guy I can't recognize him
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.780]   after that car accident.
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.960]   But yeah, that's a really cool photo, isn't it?
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.120]   Isn't it?
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:14.980]   I love that.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.460]   Somebody tweeted to me that this today.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.340]   And I didn't recognize any of those people.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.980]   That's from '76.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.120]   Peter, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.900]   No, no, no, no.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.360]   That's old indie.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.500]   This is now?
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.780]   That's the cast.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.640]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.180]   I stand by.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.820]   I thought the exact same thing.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.940]   I thought that looks like that's from the original Star Wars.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:36.580]   And I was trying to figure out where's Princess Leia.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.140]   I don't see anybody with buns.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.820]   Sector nine, enhance.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.460]   All right.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.100]   OK, stand by.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.900]   Stand by.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.300]   Stop.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.460]   Hold that.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.420]   See, that's old indie.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.940]   She thinks there's--
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.460]   Right here?
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.460]   Zip it.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.700]   That-- that-- that's what she's starting to do.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.500]   Our show today brought to you by--
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.000]   wait a minute.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.300]   What are you holding up your hand for now?
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.420]   Chad's telling me to stop.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.140]   We're going to have to do an edit point.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:03.860]   Why?
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.340]   The whole tricaster broke.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:05.980]   The whole tric--
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.100]   Star Wars was--
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.660]   I blame you, Merlin, man.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.300]   This was working fine.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.020]   You showed up.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.260]   I'm your podcaster, Leo.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.420]   Shouldn't have said that.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.460]   I shouldn't open my Yakobot Obama earlier.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.100]   I brought this Obama.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.540]   Thanks, Obama.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.340]   Thanks, Obama.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.500]   Another thing, another fine mess you've got us into.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.140]   So I did literally just order the 10 volume slip case
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.420]   set of "The Sandman."
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.700]   Because I've read them onesie-toozy.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.220]   I'm fantastic.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.660]   You know, people are hard on the "Watchmen" movie.
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:36.740]   Look at that.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.460]   Which is a shame.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.100]   But what's nice is if you get the Blu-ray,
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.380]   it comes with a copy of the comic.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.500]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.380]   For what it's worth.
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.380]   That's nice.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.700]   It's a good movie.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.020]   You know, I didn't mind that movie,
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:48.860]   but I had not read the comic.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.260]   I think that movie is going to get an easier time over the years.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.260]   It's so close for people who are super fans.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.820]   Yeah, so close.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.140]   OK, so is the "Potty Break"?
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.060]   Yeah, "Potty Break," everybody, except me.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.380]   Yeah, it's fixed.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.060]   "What are the Dark Knight Returns" as well, Leo?
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.180]   I have that.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.340]   Frank Miller in "Hardcover," I have that.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.820]   Also, you should get "Dare Devil" with Frank Miller
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.860]   and "Clouds" Janssen.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.740]   Really?
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.220]   Really?
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:10.220]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.140]   That's fantastic, Leo.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.820]   I saw the movie and I thought, mmm.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.780]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.100]   It's like four different "Dare Devil" runs that are really good.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.300]   But if you like Frank Miller--
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.780]   I love Frank Miller.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.460]   Yes, it's fantastic.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.660]   He is my-- see, I never got in the comic books as a kid.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.900]   You guys really are just reliving your childhood.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.100]   I was programming for 100.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.380]   You should see the response called three.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:32.900]   Three.
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.580]   Oh, look, there's what I just ordered.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.380]   Wait a minute, you haven't in "Hardcover."
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.740]   Of course, that's what she said.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.740]   Oh.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.180]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:39.980]   I got the wrong one.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.540]   They don't have a hardcover on Amazon.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.500]   You do have absolute sand, man, Leo.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.140]   Look for that.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.260]   Oh, I'm going to quickly cancel this.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.220]   I would show you mine, but Guy English has them right now.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.940]   So I don't want paper back.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.140]   This is the best one.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.180]   This is the--
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.380]   Cancelling.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.300]   This is the volume that has the emperor Norton story.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.860]   Cancel, ordered by mistake.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.580]   What do you say when you cancel on Amazon?
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.620]   Think they say select cancellation reason.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.100]   And mostly, it's just because I don't want it anymore.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.460]   That darn kid of mine.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.140]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.460]   They should have that.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.300]   They should have a drop down.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.180]   This is too easy to order in the first place.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.180]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.180]   Your stupid one click gets me in trouble every time.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.660]   So it's called-- what is it?
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.060]   Sandman-- Sandman.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.420]   This one, this is absolute sand, man.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.460]   Absolute sand, man.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.700]   I don't know if I have that.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.620]   Is that the complete sand?
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.780]   There's-- they've done these things
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.860]   where they recolored the entire thing,
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.860]   and there's bonus.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.700]   There's volumes.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.900]   There's four volumes.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.300]   Well, now I'm talking $500.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.180]   Oh, so worth it, Leo.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.100]   I just wanted one thing.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.420]   You see, you're already thinking about it too much.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.740]   This is why one click is so good.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.820]   And this is why Comixology is screwing them stuff.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.140]   You see $80 bucks each.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.900]   If you give yourself five seconds to think about whether I want
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.620]   to start getting into the original Sin Maxi series on Marvel,
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.700]   you're not going to buy it.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.620]   It's a five second thought process.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.340]   There are five volumes at almost $80 each.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.340]   We're talking $400.
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.420]   But it's kind of ribbon.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.980]   You see a ribbon that's like a ribbon bookmark.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.380]   It's classy as hell.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.100]   Should I order volume one and see if I like it?
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.860]   Here's the barcode.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.380]   Just like grab the barcode after this.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.820]   OK, that's all you need to do.
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.660]   Anyone who's downloading this, just get this barcode.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.940]   You can't go half wrong with it.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.660]   I watched that silly newspaper Comix movie you mentioned,
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.260]   and I went out and got the complete Calvin and Hobbes
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.020]   because of you.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.020]   Now there--
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.540]   There you go.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.980]   And now your life is so much better.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.860]   There's a happy face on your absolute watch.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.860]   What can you guys are such nerds?
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.620]   See, not just we had comments, but we
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.260]   could bring out our slip case editions on 30 seconds notice.
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.500]   They're sitting next to you at all times.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.260]   So good.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.660]   Of course, you don't have the tip-in book plate that
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.260]   had the Dave McKee and the thing of sharing this.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.140]   What's that, Merlin?
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.620]   What's that?
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.660]   Is that hard drives?
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.060]   Oh, you're muted.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.780]   You're muted, but I'm sure he's saying something fast.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.780]   We can't hear you.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.220]   Audio gone.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.260]   I was just going to say, if you're really a fan of Sam
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:21.340]   and do what I did and get the raw files, it's $165,000.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.260]   Aaron Berger, change your Dropbox password.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.100]   Daniel gave his hard drives.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.140]   That's not for another few days because I'm still
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.540]   downloading the finale.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.620]   Oh, my god.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.780]   I love you guys.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:33.820]   Let's just forget this.
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.380]   Just do this show from now on.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.380]   This is comics are fun.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.380]   It's break weekly.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.180]   Comics break weekly.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.140]   And even if we don't go over it, guess what, everybody?
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.020]   Our comicsology purchases this week are text deductible.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.220]   Yay, everybody.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.060]   Let me see.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.900]   I'm just still pressing Add to Cart.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.940]   OK.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.900]   I think I have all five now.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.900]   This isn't the show, is it?
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.980]   Fuck yes.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.260]   Merlin, don't you remember?
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.380]   You just clarified listeners that this is not
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.700]   like the two-minute CNN news capsule
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.780]   that you get at the airport.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.860]   OK, this is a full hour, sometimes eight hours of conversation
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.540]   about people who have made many of the same life choices
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.820]   that you have, starting with, or maybe ending
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.940]   with purchasing Apple products.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.380]   If you're on board with this, we'll have a great time.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.980]   If you're not on board with this, we are--
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.780]   sorry about that.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.380]   Our show--
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.660]   --gets a cruise.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.740]   The TriCaster is working.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.820]   Everything's working.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.220]   Our show today brought to you by LegalSume.com.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:35.460]   It all-- you know, Merlin shows up and it all goes to hell.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.300]   Radho--
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:42.420]   Oh my god, I haven't had this much fun in a long time.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.300]   LegalSume is not a law firm.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.820]   My friends, they're better.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.300]   They provide you with self-help services
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.540]   at your specific direction to do the things you need
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.100]   to do to start your own business, to protect your family,
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.740]   protect your trademark.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:59.460]   I mean, if you had a website called, let's say, 43 folders,
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.700]   you'd want to trademark that, make sure no one else would
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.860]   make the fake 43 folders.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.740]   You knew you wouldn't want to allow that.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:06.820]   And you know what?
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.300]   It's only $169 at LegalSume.com.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.420]   Plus, you don't have to get on the horn with some attorney
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.220]   and know that the clock is ticking and you're
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.180]   spending hundreds of dollars an hour.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.660]   You do it all online at your leisure.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.780]   It's really fairly quick.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.900]   Same thing with an S or C corp or an LLC.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.900]   That's what I did.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.260]   $99.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.540]   And then you pay the state filing fee.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:27.700]   I don't remember what that was.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.540]   It was a couple hundred bucks.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.460]   And you're a corporation.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:30.940]   They help you.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.100]   They do the whole-- you know, they get it all done for you.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.660]   If you've got a family and you don't have a will,
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.340]   you've got to get $169.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.100]   And by the way, look under the wills and trusts
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.180]   because there's also things like the health care power
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.500]   of attorney, which is really important.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.820]   A pet protection agreement, living trusts.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.980]   It's all here.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.540]   Now, if you want help from an attorney,
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.620]   don't think you can't get that.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.500]   You can get that as well.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.980]   They have pre-negotiated flat rate fees
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.140]   with experienced attorneys in your state.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.180]   You can read the attorney's profile.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.660]   But you can also read unedited reviews from clients.
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:08.380]   So you really have a sense of who's good, who will fit your needs.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.260]   Do you want somebody who explains every detail to you?
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.220]   Do you want somebody who just gives you the highlights?
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.020]   Do you want somebody who just tells you what to do?
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:14.780]   It's all here.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.260]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.620]   I want you to try it today.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.580]   It's not a law firm.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.540]   They provide legal help through independent attorneys
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.340]   and self-help services.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.540]   Visit LegalZoom.com.

[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.260]   except Merlin, who is unaffiliated.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.460]   Currently unaffiliated.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:37.980]   Yes.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.180]   My dad has a new ad.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.540]   Your dad is an attorney.
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.060]   He has an attorney.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.340]   He has a new ad on YouTube.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:42.740]   What?
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.180]   Oh, I got a--
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.540]   I just emailed it to you.
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.980]   Alex Lindsay's dad's ad.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:47.460]   Hold on.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.460]   I think I just emailed it to you.
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:48.800]   Hold on.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.300]   Email.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.220]   I can put it on--
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.100]   That's not exactly real time, is it?
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:52.620]   I don't know.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:52.900]   I didn't know.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.260]   Email.
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:53.740]   There it is.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.740]   Oh, he's such a dapper, old fellow.
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:56.740]   Now, did you shoot this?
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.740]   No, no, no, someone else shot it.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:59.940]   He didn't even have you.
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:00.540]   No.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.540]   Shoot it?
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.940]   The Lindsay law firm, and it's called Outlaws.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.540]   Let's go full screen on the Lindsay law firm.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.140]   More and more, we hear from people
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.540]   who have suffered abuse from local, state, and federal agents.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.340]   Overzealous law enforcement.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.340]   Overzealous social agencies.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   If you and David correct--
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.340]   We're in effect for our Constitution.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.340]   Our clients tell us about things that
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.740]   are well un-American.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.340]   What?
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.340]   My name is Al Lindsay.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.340]   We file lawsuits against those outlaws
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.540]   masquerading as public servants.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.740]   That's a four-point pocket square, my friends.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.740]   He means business.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.940]   Is Dad like a survivalist?
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:39.740]   What is Dad's--
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.140]   No, my dad used to--
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:46.340]   So my dad has a long history of putting--
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.340]   he was a federal prosecutor, mostly dealt with corruption.
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:54.940]   And so in the '70s, he put up about half of the Pennsylvania--
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.700]   half of a pen dot, Pennsylvania Department
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.260]   Transportation in jail.
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.940]   And has since-- if you got roughed up by the police,
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.340]   or you're--
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.740]   Now he's singing for the rotten roads.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.740]   So it works in both ways, right?
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.740]   Exactly.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.740]   No, no, yeah.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.740]   But he's no one to be messed with.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.740]   Oh, my God.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.340]   We used to be-- watching my dad cross-examine
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.940]   like a federal position when I was a kid was better than football.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.940]   A kid like--
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:21.940]   [WHISTLE]
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:22.940]   Watch him.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:23.940]   Watch him.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:24.940]   It's fun.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:29.740]   So Apple has updated the MacBook Air processor bump $100 price drop.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.740]   Good news.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.460]   That is a really good news.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:37.740]   Now these are just the latest Intel processors, right?
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.740]   Still has well.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.940]   They were always has well.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:40.940]   We're not--
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.540]   It's just like 100 megahertz.
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.540]   It's not like you're going to notice it.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.540]   Right.
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.540]   But the price is down 100 bucks.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.540]   You'll will notice that.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.540]   And that's a huge deal.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:53.540]   It's gone from a slightly ridiculous $999 quote,
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:58.060]   "budget" unquote MacBook to something that's at least closer to within reach of what people
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:03.060]   can get for Windows 7 or Windows 8 Notebook.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:07.060]   What got me a little bit curious about it though is that I wonder where this actually
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.580]   leaves the 9.7 inch iPad Air.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.340]   Because now you've got-- if you have people like me who were very, very intrigued by the
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:20.340]   iPad as a replacement for a laptop as a real ultra mobile device, by dropping the price
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.900]   of the iPad Air 100 bucks, now it's kind of-- the 11 inch model is now kind of within
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:29.300]   reach of the sort of iPad that you would get if you were intending to use it as a productivity
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.300]   device.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.340]   So now you-- it complicates into a little bit.
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:37.100]   Now it's maybe a $100 price difference if you factor in the cost of getting a keyboard.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.660]   So I wonder how this will affect people who were really considering getting the full-sized
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:45.940]   iPad for that reason, and it also colors the rumor, underscore rumor that Apple's considering
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:53.380]   a 13 inch iPad Pro, that if there is now a $900 MacBook that is almost as small as an
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:58.220]   existing iPad, gets pretty much the same battery life, but runs desktop software, including
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.340]   photo editing, including movie editing.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:04.260]   I wonder what room there might be for a larger sized iPad, what the purpose of that would
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.260]   even be.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:12.380]   Is this-- it doesn't seem like it, but is this prior to the release of the rumored 12 inch
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.620]   air or-- they're not clearing out stock because these are updated machines?
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.780]   Well, I guess I'm fairly modal about these.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.380]   I mean, I look at the way I use my iPad and the way I use my 11 inch very, very differently,
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:30.260]   you know, which I have both, you know, with me almost all the time.
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.500]   But you know, for me, you know, I don't really think about the keyboard, you know, adding
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.540]   the keyboard to my iPad and it's-- I use it on the apps in a specific way.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:42.780]   No, 11 inch, for $8.99 and includes the keyboard, faster processors, more memory, more storage.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.780]   It's great.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.780]   That's a great price.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.580]   And by the way, you know, the school that I advise stopped buying MacBooks because they
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.020]   couldn't afford them anymore.
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.020]   Right.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.020]   And they started buying Lenovo Windows 8,000 machines for students.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.020]   How's that looking?
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.100]   Actually, it's working all right.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.820]   Because nowadays everybody's-- you know, I tell them, just get Chromebooks, everybody's
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.820]   here.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:01.820]   Right.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.820]   The cloud.
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.820]   Right.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:08.140]   The right 8.99 for the base model 11 inch, it's exactly right for education.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.140]   So I think that that's probably another--
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:14.980]   And the timing is interesting too because if I remember at least a couple of years ago,
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.620]   this is a-- if you are putting in orders for educational buying, you need to get those
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.300]   in by April or May.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.380]   So it's a very opportune time to introduce a price drop to try to encourage more people
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.700]   to buy errors instead of something else.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.620]   And it doesn't so much clear out stock as it clears out a price point.
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:34.820]   MacBooks is usually pretty good about filling in the price ranges in $100 or a couple hundred
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:38.700]   dollar increments and bringing the traditional MacBook Air down in price.
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.740]   If there is a Retina MacBook Air coming out, then they can sort of piggyback those two releases
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:47.020]   the way they did the original MacBook Pro and the Retina MacBook Pro because the Retina
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.780]   version is always more expensive to start.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:51.140]   It takes a while to get that down to reasonable amounts.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.780]   So having the lower price version is a good benefit for everybody.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:54.780]   Is it just the 8.99?
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.820]   Is that the only one that's dropped or have they dropped across the board?
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:58.820]   I can't remember.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.820]   All the way across the board.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.220]   The model every single configuration is not $100 less.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:07.500]   But to Renee's point, I think the immediate impact is that it puts a little bit more breathing
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:13.420]   room between the prices of MacBook Airs and MacBook Pro Retinas, which until yesterday
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:19.940]   we're so close that I think a lot of people who would naturally be looking at a 13 inch
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:24.340]   air are thinking, "Well, geez, if I spend just a couple, like a hundred bucks or a little
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:26.620]   bit more than that, I'll get a much, much better display.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.140]   I'll get an HDMI port.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:33.140]   I'll get a machine that, if you're savvy enough to think about this sort of stuff, might be
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:37.420]   easier to upgrade with third party unapproved upgrades in the future."
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.900]   I've always thought it was a little bit confusing that you're making people make a very, very
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:46.780]   fine grain distinction between, "Do I want something that is smaller but not that much
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.740]   smaller than a MacBook Pro Retina?
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.180]   Do I want something that has a little bit longer battery life but not that much longer
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:56.220]   battery life in terms of being out for a day and not having to take my charger with me?"
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.660]   I'm glad that they put a little bit more air in that price range.
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:02.500]   It makes a clearer choice for people who are naturally inclined toward getting a Retina
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.620]   Mac Pro to get that one.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:08.220]   People who are naturally inclined to get a 13 inch air to get that 13 inch air.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.060]   It continues to really put the squeeze on the PC in the industry.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:17.140]   No one has really produced a computer that really provides what these do on the other
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:23.220]   platforms as far as connectivity and power and the entire package.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.580]   It's put a lot of pressure.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:30.340]   The iPads obviously in tablets have put both Android and iOS tablets have put basically
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.340]   wiped out the netbook.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:38.500]   Well, we haven't talked since Apple released its quarterly results last week, but everything
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.060]   was up except the iPad.
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.220]   iPads sales were tumbling.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.380]   And year to year, not just quarter to quarter, which you expected to drop.
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.500]   Well, adjusted, they were flat.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.500]   Adjusted for what?
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.860]   Well, if you listen to Tim Cook's explanation of it because of sell in versus sell through
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.820]   and because they had a trouble meeting demand for the iPad mini, the actual adjusted rate
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:02.140]   is like minus 3%, not the 10 plus percent that it looks like on the books, which is a
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.500]   very sort of it's a complicated procedure.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.180]   But basically they couldn't make enough to meet demand last quarter.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:12.300]   So it was the demand was shifted to the next quarter, which raised those numbers.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.300]   Okay.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.740]   Yeah, he explains it well, but it's a tough thing to.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.740]   Okay.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.260]   It ends up being minus three.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:23.380]   It ended up being flat, which is interesting because he again stressed that the iPad was
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.980]   their fastest ramp up ever.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:29.820]   It sold 210 million units twice as fast as the iPhone did seven times as fast as the
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.980]   iPod did.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.580]   And the only analogy I can make is like when you have a Lamborghini, it's phenomenal unless
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.740]   you have the same 100 mile an hour speed limit as everybody else.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.420]   Otherwise you're just getting to that point much faster.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:48.060]   Anand supposes that what they're doing is making room in the pricing for a retina air.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.060]   Incredible.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.060]   Yep.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.060]   Sure.
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.060]   June.
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:56.700]   I don't know.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:57.700]   You'd need.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.300]   I still I'm still better than imagine.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.780]   I just hope that they put enough power behind the GPU because I still, you know, I still
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.260]   feel like that's what I was going to say.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.140]   You need to be able to put iris graphics in it.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.140]   Yes.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.500]   I just I just keep trying to evaluate the question.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.420]   What problem would they solve by having a retina air?
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:18.820]   What is it about people who are people who are buying the retina?
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.860]   Who are buying the MacBook Air right now that are demanding that same battery life but
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   also a retina display?
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   It'd be nice to have.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.780]   But I'm not sure they'd want to pay extra for it.
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.580]   I'm not sure they'd want to trade off battery for it.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:32.460]   I know for us, one of the things we would love to see is a higher resolution 11 inch.
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:36.820]   And it really is because some of the apps that we want to run on it really work better
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.980]   with more real estate, even if it was smaller buttons.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.380]   People buy these ears.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:44.340]   That's not just your battery life, but also portability.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.620]   So but that does not mean that they don't care about a high res screen.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.580]   There are applications as yours are.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.580]   Right.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.700]   Photographers are like, I think a lot of applications.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.820]   We use we use these little 11 inches to run our switchers or little black magic switchers.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.420]   And we can't really open it on an 11 inch.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.660]   You need a 13 inch to do it and and do some other stuff with the retinas that make it
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.660]   worth it.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.660]   But it's a very specialized thing.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.460]   I don't know if our use case is not a really good use case.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.460]   That's super boutique.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.980]   And plus remember that the 11 inch gets worse battery life than the 13 because they're simply
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:15.220]   not enough, not as much space to put batteries in.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.220]   Right.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:18.420]   They did improve battery life, supposedly on these as well.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.420]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.860]   Not across the board for for for right today.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.860]   They mentioned the press release, improved battery life for iTunes use, but they don't
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.740]   mention it as as an across the board increase.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.900]   Just just for iTunes use.
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.300]   Oh, they do they do they do such a great job integrating their own software with whatever
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.700]   the capabilities of the CPU are that that's not terribly surprising too bad.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.460]   They couldn't give us a little bit of a bump there, but.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.860]   So again, an on has done a very good job of talking about the CPU choices, what you
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:48.380]   give up, what you get, whether it's worth spending the money and so forth.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.380]   Actually, this is an older article.
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.500]   And I would highly suggest an I seven.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.500]   Right.
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.140]   Yeah, I mean, it does make a difference.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.140]   It does make a difference.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.500]   We do a lot of tests.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.980]   And well, here's the deal.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:00.820]   If you're going to do any video conferencing, if you're going to use Skype or hangouts or
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:06.460]   other things like that, they do use that CPU and you will look better.
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.660]   I promise you the difference in the I five.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.820]   Unless I'm mistaken, but when I'm sure Renee will correct me, the difference in I five
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.700]   and I seven is is not the number of cores, but the hyper threading.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.540]   So you have four cores, but they're hyper threaded.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.700]   So you get an effect eight threads versus four threads.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.700]   We've definitely seen performance.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.700]   Does that right Renee?
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:24.700]   Am I correct?
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:25.700]   Is that the difference in the final seven?
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.220]   I don't call if the ones in the MacBook Air quad core, they might still be dual core.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.220]   Well, whatever you get, you hyper threading doubles the number of possible threads without
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.220]   doubling the CPUs.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.980]   Oh, and there may be more cash.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:35.980]   I think you're right.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.180]   There might be more L2 cash.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:42.380]   So that makes a big difference in performance on anything.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:45.360]   My only reason I bring that up is because unless your app is hyper threaded or supports
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.540]   hyper threading, you're not going to see a huge bet.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.540]   Right.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.740]   We've seen it with video conferencing because that's what we do a lot of.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.460]   So we're sensitive to that.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.900]   I mean, if you're not going to do anything like that, you don't really care, then it's
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:56.900]   not worth it.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.100]   You do an emailing surfing, but it's usually given that it just got dropped by price, you
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:04.780]   know, dropped by a hundred dollars, a little bit more gets you a lot.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:08.980]   There's an ice is, of course, the SSD drives, of course, make all of these things way faster.
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.940]   I mean, that's that makes more of a difference to performance for most people than anything
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.380]   they're going to do on the computer is just not having a spinning drive, which is, you
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.460]   know, almost gone now.
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:21.180]   And it's only 150 bucks more for the I7.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.180]   Right.
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:23.380]   So you went down to just think of it.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.580]   It's $50 more to have an I7 and one 50 base.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.620]   No, but I'm saying it's $50 more than you said.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.220]   You're right to have and now you can get an I7 with it.
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.220]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.100]   And again, it just shows us how bound Apple is to Intel's roadmap.
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:36.140]   They'll make these machines better when they get the chips to make them better and they'll
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.540]   put out new ones when they get the chips to make new ones.
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.540]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:45.100]   And also the Intel's improvements in their CPUs are floating all boats and the Intel
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:49.860]   Ultra books have been lagging behind the the errors because they just couldn't match the
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:50.860]   battery performance.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:54.380]   But now that with last year's generation of CPUs that does a lot of that power management
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:56.380]   just gives them free.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.340]   There's it's not so there there are there are still huge advantages to having the back
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:05.580]   book air in terms of instead of adding other windows, ultra book, but the the the the the
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.820]   key trade off that people have been suffering with windows is that, well, I don't want to
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.820]   I want this ultra light.
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.260]   I don't want to for our battery life.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.260]   Well, now that's been erased.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:18.900]   I get at least six or seven sometimes eight new rumor reported at Mac rumors from China
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:26.940]   times via G4 games that the I watch is already in production in a small quantity in preparation
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.060]   for this is not a picture of the I watch for those of you watching a video.
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:37.020]   This is a concept, a nice concept, but not the night watch.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:41.740]   But the thinking or according to the rumor is that they would launch in the second half
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.260]   of 2014 the fall.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:50.060]   I don't don't you Renee and I more don't didn't the last time we talked you you you thought
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.620]   it might not be till 2015.
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:55.660]   Well, last year they put them into production and took them out of the labs and put them
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:56.660]   into production.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.860]   But all of these things, the nice thing about Apple not pre announcing stuff and not setting
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.860]   dates to things is they can just launch them when they're ready.
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:06.780]   And I'm sure if if they can provide the kind of experience that they want to provide,
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.660]   including screen quality, including battery quality, including the software quality, if
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.100]   they can get all those things lined up, then they'll have an event and they'll announce
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.100]   it.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.220]   If they can't, it'll just very quietly and we'll see a bunch of reports saying Apple's
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:21.320]   delayed a product that they never announced of course, but they'll just move it into a
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.900]   slot when they can get all those things done.
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.580]   So I mean, I wouldn't be surprised to see it this year.
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.060]   I wouldn't be surprised to see it early.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.580]   It's unknown for me.
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:33.500]   It just comes down to I don't think Apple's feeling any pressure to ship this sooner rather
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.500]   than later.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.980]   So I'm not going to be I'm not going to stick to any timeline or even any probability that's
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:38.980]   going to ship.
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:39.980]   Right.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.060]   I do think that WWDC may turn out to be a very interesting.
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.060]   I think so.
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:48.540]   I mean, for talking about stuff, I mean, I don't know about the I watch, but I definitely
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:52.900]   think for Apple TV and some of the other things I think we might see some announcements
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.300]   to give developers enough.
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:58.100]   I don't know why.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.100]   It's time.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.740]   Well, finally, we were still waiting for his yellow submarine.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.860]   Take my money out.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.940]   I think we could safely put that rumor to bed now.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.260]   You know, if you wait long enough, anything will happen.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.100]   Body and any girl will survive.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:17.100]   That's how they surprise you.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.820]   They just don't they don't talk about it at all for years, sometimes decades and then
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.540]   they just pop it out.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:28.020]   Tim Cook, actually, there's a lot to parse from the quarterly results.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.020]   So I guess we go through this.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.020]   Why don't you give us some questions though?
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.020]   Okay, we got faces.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:35.140]   It's bitly bitt.ly/mbw 400.
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:38.580]   That's our Q and A our beta of the Q and A.
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.580]   The Q and A that we're considering for this show and others.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.460]   You can ask questions and vote them up and down.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.700]   So go ahead and go there.
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:44.860]   The first question.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:49.380]   Number one question is from Stacy in Aurora, Illinois, and she asked Will Merlin come back
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:51.220]   and be a regular.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:52.220]   That's number one.
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:53.220]   Thank you, Merlin.
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.220]   That is the number one question.
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:55.220]   I love you.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.220]   Thank you, Stacy.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.260]   I'm not much of a regular or anything, but I'd love to come back.
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:01.220]   Well, we'll put you in our list.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:02.220]   We'll put you in our list.
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.220]   We'll rotate.
[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:04.580]   Yeah, we'll ask you every month or so.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:09.740]   I just see you know, I'm not talking because I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.140]   I don't know what any of this means.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:13.500]   I don't know what a hyper thread is.
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.500]   It's irrelevant.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:16.300]   You guys have evolved way beyond you.
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:17.300]   No, no, no, no.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.300]   You only said that.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.260]   You always said, oh, I don't have anything to contribute blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.500]   But look, number one question.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.500]   Everyone wants you back.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.500]   Everybody loves Merlin, man.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.100]   Well, I will learn about Haswell.
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.060]   No, no, you don't have to.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.060]   You don't have to.
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.060]   You have to be yourself.
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.060]   No, I would go to the background.
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.060]   It's an honor to be here.
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:34.340]   Yeah, you're the guy we all love.
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.140]   Talk to us about Omni Focus on a watch.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.140]   That's all we want to know.
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.140]   Don't give me a touch.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.380]   I'm a text expander on a watch.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:46.140]   The watch thing for me is like, I still, I don't get it.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:47.140]   I don't see it.
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:48.140]   Do you wear a watch?
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:49.140]   Do you wear a watch?
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.460]   No, I have a Fitbit and I have a phone.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.460]   There you go.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:57.420]   So, you know, it's, it's, you know, having said that, it's a rat hole.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:04.180]   I don't want to open it up, but it's funny how Apple was able to, Apple and their partners
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.220]   and the App Store and everything.
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:11.580]   We're able to up end an entire industry by presenting us with this thing called an iPhone.
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:12.580]   Right.
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.340]   And it's almost like those crazy people on AM radio in the middle of the night who talk
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.860]   about the grays and how they're going to, they're slowly introducing these things so
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.380]   that we won't be freaked out when the aliens come.
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:25.900]   It's kind of what Apple did where they said, here's this thing and it's a phone.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:30.460]   And it's like, I will do everything in my power to avoid using my iPhone as a phone.
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.460]   Because it's so good for so many other things.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:37.540]   And I don't know if that's making sense, but you know, it's the, the, the third part
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:41.060]   of Steve's presentation, the internet communicator part ends up being the part that I really
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:41.980]   love the most.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.500]   You know, I listen to podcasts a lot.
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:45.700]   I use it for music.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:51.460]   And really I use it so much for a Safari and use it for texting.
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:55.700]   But I guess what I'm trying to say is that in, you know, in 2007, they were able to sneak
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:59.660]   this thing in under the radar screen of what seemed possible by saying, you know how you
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:00.660]   hate your phone?
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:01.820]   Well, this is a better phone.
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:03.180]   And then we all liked it.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.860]   And now in my case, I have call forwarding on all the time.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:06.980]   I hate using it as a phone.
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.980]   It drives me crazy.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:08.980]   And I don't.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.860]   And I wonder if that's what's going to happen with the watch.
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.060]   It's like, we're going to call this a watch, but the last thing you need to worry about,
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.300]   the time part, that's easy.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:20.620]   It's just I'm intrigued to see like what makes this a game changer, even half an order or
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.780]   more magnitude smaller than the iPhone or the iPad.
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:27.340]   It just, you know, it just seems like an odd thing for Apple to make based on what I can
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.340]   imagine.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.540]   And that's just a failure of my own imagination.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:34.260]   But when you threw up that image of the, of every one of these prototypes I look at,
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:38.620]   I'm like, that would not pass the first sniff test at an Apple eating, you know?
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.620]   Yes.
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:41.860]   So I don't, I'm intrigued to see what happens.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.380]   And I'll certainly, you know, like every sucker line up and buy it.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:45.780]   I love my Fitbit.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:47.060]   I love the tracking stuff.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:51.180]   What's the price point that you beyond which you would not go?
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.180]   Personally or what?
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:56.060]   Well, you can say personally or, you know, as a group.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:00.900]   Well, my fake analyst hat says it depends on what it is that the thing does.
[00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:05.740]   But yeah, on the, there are, boy, I'm so uncomfortable talking about this because I don't know what
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:06.740]   I'm talking about.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.820]   But a lot of people seem to think, oh, it's going to be this premium thing for the kind
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.980]   of people who go out and buy those big douchebag watches that'll gladly drop $1,000 on this
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:14.980]   thing.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.580]   I see this being more like an iPod nano.
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.260]   I see this.
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:21.380]   I see this being more like an iPod.
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:24.260]   I was raising my hand for the audio listeners.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:26.140]   I love douchebag watches.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.140]   I got to do.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.140]   Look, he's got a douchebag watch.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.140]   That's a nice one.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.140]   Think about the Apple TV.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.140]   douchebagwatches.com taken.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.620]   It's not, it's not a thousand dollars.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.620]   I see a store.
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:34.820]   But I like it.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.380]   It's a citizen eco drive.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:43.100]   When the Apple TV came out, it was really truly very little more than a way to buy stuff
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.100]   from iTunes.
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.340]   Sorry, I have to go buy his watch now.
[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:51.020]   See, look, I hooked Leo.
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.180]   I just go to my watch.
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:55.860]   I always wanted to sit as an eco drive.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:00.540]   I'm thinking, I'm going to say $4.99 is the absolute highest price that I should make
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.540]   it go on this.
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:02.540]   Webinars on that, Alex?
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.540]   Yes, it does.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.700]   There's a camera in it.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.100]   These are a couple hundred bucks, right?
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.020]   These are hugely expensive.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.020]   Which one do you have?
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:12.020]   This is close.
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:16.660]   Eco drive Skyhawk AT Titanium 671 bucks.
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:18.140]   I got mine for less.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.380]   But eco drive means it's solar powered, right?
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:21.380]   No.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:22.380]   I don't know.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:23.380]   What does it mean?
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:26.220]   It had, it had, it had, I had very specific, I just want to say I had very specific rules
[00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:31.420]   about my watch was that it had to be able to do two, two time zones, digital and analog
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.420]   separately.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:33.420]   Right.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:35.460]   And it had to, I had to be able to change the time zones really quickly.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:37.700]   And there's three watches in existence that I know of.
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:42.660]   Casio makes one, Cas, Citizen makes one, and Tog Howard makes one, which I can't, it's
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:43.660]   6,000.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:46.180]   I've been wearing the basis watch, which actually gets its time from the phone.
[00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:48.580]   And it does do time zones because of that.
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:52.140]   If you leave this one outside out by your window, it'll automatically be synced to
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.140]   the atomic law.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:58.540]   But, but so a lot of people have looked at, for instance, this fear fit thinking, well,
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:02.100]   that looks like kind of like something I would like.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.140]   And then those who have tried it now say, no, it's horrible.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.140]   Yep.
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.660]   It's not getting good reviews at all.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.100]   And this was very close to the concept designs we'd seen from people.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.860]   Well, and I think that Samsung is doing a lot of favors for Apple.
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.060]   I mean, Apple did a lot of favors for them.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:20.460]   But Apple gets a look at that going, okay, well, scratch that off.
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:23.820]   But anyway, it's a, so you have a sky, huh?
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.260]   I don't know if I have a sky hocker.
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.260]   It's, it looks very similar.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.260]   It looks very similar.
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.260]   What is this thing?
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.260]   Radio controlled.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.260]   Yeah, because it's radio controlled.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.740]   Because what is that dial here?
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.740]   Atomic time.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.740]   Well, it does a lot of different things.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.740]   You can dial around and get more features.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.740]   That's the point I know.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.620]   That is the one I use the point.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.540]   Does it pass the sniff test?
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.540]   What is this guy?
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:45.860]   Well, actually, Leo, at the end of the day, net net, what it allows you to do is drill
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.940]   down deep into the time and really get in there from a bottom up approach.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.340]   We're not going to boil the ocean.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.060]   Have you watched?
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.940]   Have you watched Silicon Valley yet?
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:59.380]   12, 22 p.m. on a far deeper level than any of us ever can.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.380]   Right.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.380]   But does he know what that means?
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.180]   It's going to, Andy, it's a highly impactful experience.
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.180]   What is this dial?
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.180]   Seriously.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.180]   TMR, CHR, WTS.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:12.180]   No, this is your chronograph, timer, alarm, alarm.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:16.580]   Which one do you hit to have your dad sue somebody?
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.580]   Calendar.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.940]   Looks like my old Windows mobile phone.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.980]   But what fun is you do get into the wrong mode and then you feel like you need to manually
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.580]   get the idea where I am now.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.740]   The big thing is I rarely spend more than a week in the same time zone.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.740]   So it's usually--
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.740]   This is nice because it has UTC.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.740]   Because I'm always trying to figure out what time it is.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:34.860]   So we've said a lot of meetings by you two years ago.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.380]   And then this tells you this one--
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.380]   What time is the year?
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.380]   The hands are in.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.940]   And then you have another one where the digital.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.940]   So a lot of times when I'm somewhere else, I'll say I know what home is and I know where
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:43.940]   Rwanda is and I know what--
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:47.940]   I'm just telling you, looking at this watch in person, everything is so tiny.
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:48.940]   I mean, you should--
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.940]   I would have to be an app for that.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.940]   Well, and the thing is, is there would be an app.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:53.940]   Give me the watch.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.940]   People want to see it here.
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.740]   See if you can read this watch.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:03.420]   It's like, have you ever seen one of those notebooks written by someone who has OCD where
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.740]   it's just page after page of microscopic writing, filling every surface?
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.740]   And that guy has a watch designer.
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.740]   You can use more watches.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.740]   Every-- closer you get, the more watches appear.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:12.740]   And I can't.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.740]   Exactly.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:14.740]   The one that I will--
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.740]   It's a mental brought watch.
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.740]   This is a fractal watch if ever I saw one.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:20.340]   I think I use everything except for the slide rule on the outside.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.340]   There's a slide rule.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.340]   There's a slide rule on the outside.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.340]   I don't use that part.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.340]   No, that's a pilot's fuel calculator.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.340]   Screws you logarithmic app on my iPad.
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.340]   It is.
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.340]   No, no, this is--
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.340]   So he doesn't even know.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.340]   I don't know what it is.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.340]   He thinks that's a slide rule.
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:34.340]   It's the fuel calculator that pyrolets.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.340]   You see, oil, pans, miles per--
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.340]   No, real--
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.340]   --imperials.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.340]   --still essentially a slide rule.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.140]   You have to go to flight school to use the watch.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.540]   But the old one, the old one was a slide rule.
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.540]   I apologize.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.220]   I feel as though we're making fun of Alex for liking something that he likes when he
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:51.220]   doesn't have to justify it in any way.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.220]   No, you're right.
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.220]   I'm sorry, Alex.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.220]   I don't really care about the rules.
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.540]   The reason I don't know what it is, I don't care what the thing is on the outside because
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.540]   I just need the other part.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.540]   I think it looks cool.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.540]   I don't know if you--
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:03.540]   I'll say, I've been wearing pebble and a couple other simple watches like that.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.620]   All I will say is the only thing that I get that I didn't get before is that so many times
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:11.220]   do I take my phone out of my pocket for a reason that does not require me to take the
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.340]   phone out of my pocket.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:17.540]   All I want to know is who is trying to get in touch with me or do I turn left, do I turn
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:21.740]   right, right here, and to take the phone out of my pocket, unlock the screen, wake and
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.540]   think it's so much easier to get that on my wrist.
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:29.420]   There is a certain amount of money that I would spend to get simple notifications on
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:31.420]   my wrist.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:37.060]   I think that Samsung is totally barking up the wrong tree by having an Android computer
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.060]   on your wrist as opposed to--
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.620]   It's not Android, isn't it?
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:45.540]   No, no, it's their own homebrew to operate.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:52.100]   As opposed to Casio having a $99 G-Shock watch that just happens to have an LCD component
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:57.060]   to a little micro window in there that can again get notifications from a watch, communicate
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.180]   to the fitness apps you've got on your iPhone and work that way.
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:04.100]   I think that smaller, cheaper, simpler is going to win the day over.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.780]   We're going to make the deep thought on your wrist.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.900]   I don't think that's going to be the successful thing.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:14.380]   That's why-- and I think that if Apple-- I think that Apple, if they try to charge more
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:18.780]   than 300 bucks for it, they're going to find so much resistance to that.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:25.420]   It would have to be rose gold, it would have to be the most Johnny I-V cool design ever
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:29.220]   to make it into a real piece of jewelry when most people are just going to want to do something
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.980]   functional other than date, time, seconds.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:37.340]   I think everyone's point about the Apple TV was very apt because you cannot sell an
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.700]   eye watch for a high enough price or sell enough of them to make them anywhere close
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.580]   to profitable at Apple levels.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.820]   But what you can do is sell it somewhat on Apple TV whereby buying it enhances the value
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:50.700]   of the iPhone and the iPad and gives Apple a better ecosystem overall.
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.140]   I don't know.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:58.100]   I think even we have limits to that, where we appreciate that if we have an iPad that
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:03.140]   makes iCloud so much better and makes our Mac so much better, and Apple TV is a second
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:06.700]   screen to almost any device we have that has Apple logo on it.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:09.420]   But when you're talking about something you're going to wear on your wrist, you start off
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.780]   with the fact that it has to be something that men and women can wear and are going
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.580]   to want to be seen in public with.
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:20.620]   And then you also come and I'm not willing to wear something 18 hours a day because maybe
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:24.820]   for 30 minutes out of that day I might want to listen to some music and might not want
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.540]   to have to reach up to get my phone.
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:29.140]   So it's a complicated calculus.
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.900]   But I think that's why you add some of the health things as well.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:39.020]   So if you replace your Fitbit with your watch and then add the ability to see who's calling
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:44.540]   or whatever without having to pull my phone out, I could definitely see that stack.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.740]   I think that's why Apple's looking at all the health things is that I don't think by itself
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:48.740]   it makes sense.
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:52.620]   I think you have to add those other bits and pieces to make it work.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:56.140]   And it's also a market of people who are willing to spend more money on a watch that
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:58.780]   does lots and lots of stuff, the fitness market.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.980]   It's not just people who will run those apps, people who are used to the idea of I'm going
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.380]   to wear this watch day after day after day, even when I'm not wearing the heart sensor
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.900]   band or even when I'm not using the other stuff that makes it work cool, I'm used to
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:12.660]   wearing this style of watch and I'm okay with people seeing me wearing this kind of watch.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.300]   Well, I think that's the thing, that's one of the use cases for me.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:20.420]   The notifications are great, but right now I'm using my iPhone for step tracking with
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:22.180]   David Smith's pedometer app.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:25.580]   But if I don't want to carry my iPhone with me, if I'm running or I'm grappling, then
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:29.100]   I have to use my Fitbit or my Nike band, but those don't sync back.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.780]   Like the M7 chip keeps track of it all, but it doesn't bring it all together.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.740]   But in an Apple, I don't even think it'll be a watch, but in an Apple band world, I could
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.420]   have my iPhone with me and it'll keep track of it.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.300]   My iPhone is with me when I don't have it.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.380]   The watch band will keep track of it and it will, a health book will just pull, pull
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.940]   all of those things together.
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:49.260]   And if I do go with Nike or I do go with Fitbit or I just use a Nike app instead, because
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:52.700]   there's an M7 chip and there's health book, all of that will just come together and it
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.700]   won't matter.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.940]   I should not have to care what device I have on me.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:57.660]   It should just track all that kind of stuff for me.
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:01.900]   And it should just, if I do have other medical needs or if I do have other notification needs,
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.140]   all that stuff can just come together.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.100]   And I think that's going to be where the value for Apple making their own band makes
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.100]   sense.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:11.940]   Well, it's a tricky market.
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.740]   There's no doubt about it.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:17.820]   And when you're competing against the Casio GPS hybrid wave scepter, it is...
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:18.820]   A wave scepter?
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.580]   No one told me there was a wave scepter involved.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:21.940]   It is not going to be easy.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.820]   Oh, dude, if I could walk around with like a scepter, like a wizard scepter that does
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.820]   all...oh man, I'd be so into that.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.180]   This features to your wife, Mutri...
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:34.340]   Mutrially complimentary time correction systems integrated into a hybrid system that provides
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:38.860]   an easier, more reliable time calibration signal reception by using GPS data to adjust
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:44.260]   the time, even in environments outside the range of extraterrestrial radio waves.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.700]   But it doesn't have a digital readout.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.700]   It doesn't pass away.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.700]   That's a total requirement.
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:49.700]   That's the date?
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.700]   No, the date.
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.700]   What do you want the date for?
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:56.700]   There are people who are absolutely not going to get dates.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:03.260]   A lot of people forwarded me a really cool video of this really...this $1,000 watch being
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.540]   assembled, all the mechanisms and all the things that have to be done by hand.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:11.340]   And that's really, really cool, but it's a cool video, but it just did not make me interested
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:13.660]   in this watch at all or any watch that costs $1,000.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:16.580]   Because to me, it's a practical and functional item.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:20.060]   It tells me that...give me the hours, give me the minutes.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.860]   Date is a good bonus, but not a deal breaker.
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:25.140]   And I want to be able to read it in the dark room in a movie theater.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.980]   And I mean, this is like the first watch I ever bought that costs more than a hundred
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:28.980]   bucks.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:29.980]   And even so, it was like maybe 200 bucks.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:33.820]   And but that's the challenge that Apple's got to face is that it is...there are many
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:38.260]   intersecting sets here, or maybe not intersecting, but there are many sets.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:44.020]   And while many geeks are watch...I mean, I've talked to Rich Segal of BB at Airborne
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:48.380]   Software, who's...he loves watch...he calls a watch porn.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:53.580]   And I feel that way too, but that is a small minority of the overall market.
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.700]   And maybe not somebody Apple wants to go after.
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.860]   On the other hand, they've got Angela Arrens now running retail.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:03.740]   And she's certainly a fashion forward executive former CEO at Burberry.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.740]   I should say...
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.740]   Look at the earnings, the Leo.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:06.740]   I mean, like the iPod market just tanked.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.740]   It just keeps tanking.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:12.260]   And most of the sales they still make are the iPod touch, it's not the traditional iPods.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:15.500]   Some of those traditional iPods, the shuffle and the nano in various incarnations, have
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   been wearable.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.820]   But they were wearables that didn't run iOS that you still had to tether to iTunes that
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.540]   were basically unmanageable by modern standards.
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:26.540]   And there's an argument to be made that Apple is very good at oblusing their own products.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:31.700]   And while the iPhone, the iPhone 5, the iPod touch have done that to some extent, the wearables
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.860]   haven't migrated yet.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:38.460]   And just a wearable that is very well connected to iOS and Apple's ecosystem could maybe not
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:42.380]   regain the heights of the iPod, but could it still provide that kind of functionality?
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:47.860]   I should point out, by the way, that last week, I said, "I don't buy tech stocks.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:50.020]   I recuse myself from that."
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:58.460]   But if I were an investor, this would be the time I said to short Apple.
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.980]   And I think it was almost immediately after I said that Apple stock, see that slope right
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:03.980]   there?
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:09.260]   That giant growth.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.260]   Is that a loss?
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:14.100]   Uppy part of the curve or is that a good, uppy part of the curve?
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.580]   It's good if you buy the stock.
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:20.780]   If you're shorting it, which is saying, "I predict the stock will go down," that's about
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.300]   the worst thing that could happen.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:28.980]   And so this is why I don't buy tech stocks.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:36.860]   I was really of the prop, perhaps foolish opinion that Apple maybe had seen better days,
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:40.420]   but then the quarterly results came up with a record profit.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:45.220]   And Apple now has the highest stock prices had in 52 weeks.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.220]   Wow.
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:49.020]   Yeah, so maybe that was a mistake.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.500]   And goodness for the iPhone.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.780]   Yeah, see, this is why Apple has so much freedom.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:58.260]   It's like you have to ask yourself, are they in any position where they absolutely need
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:02.220]   to ship a certain product on anybody's timeline except for their own?
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.340]   And then you look at a graph like that, it said, "No, they can wait until next year,
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.340]   if they want to."
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.340]   No pressure.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:10.380]   And they can let certain analysts and pundits complain about the lack of quote innovation
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.340]   and about how other people are catching up, but they have enough.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:16.580]   They've got so much fuel in the tank that they have the freedom to create their own
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:20.460]   destiny, and that is the definition of a company that has actual power, the freedom
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.100]   to create your own destiny.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.900]   So the seven-for-one stock split Apple has said on its FAQ, the reason they're doing
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:32.580]   seven-for-one is to make the stock more affordable to small investors so that somebody like me
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:35.300]   could buy 10 shares and not break this bag.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.300]   You can buy one share.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.300]   No, no, no, Apple could buy a share.
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:39.300]   I'm going to show about Mac.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:44.300]   But they probably rather have you buy a backbook here.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.300]   Those are probably more profitable to them.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:49.300]   There's more profit built into that than that share of stock.
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.300]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.300]   If Alex had a share for every Mac he'd bought.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.300]   Pretty, that would be great.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.300]   Pretty.
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:59.300]   What is the link that Jeff Needle sent us of the profit versus revenue infographic?
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.300]   It was a visualization.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.300]   I can pull it up for you.
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.300]   Yeah, it was really cool.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:11.780]   It showed how profitable Apple is compared to everybody else.
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:12.780]   Real time.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:13.780]   So freaky.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:14.780]   Have you seen it?
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:15.780]   That's on level profit.
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.260]   I've seen a few over time.
[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:20.420]   I think John Grubber is linked to in the past.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:26.700]   The one that shows just a real simple one, which I think was just the breakdown of profit
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.140]   in the mobile space.
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.140]   This is it.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.340]   I don't think this is not what I call simple.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:37.340]   But the grace fear in the upper right hand corner is Apple.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:40.340]   The center of the core is profit.
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:42.340]   What they take home.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:44.340]   The total sphere is revenue.
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:45.340]   And this is real time.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.340]   You see it growing right now.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.340]   That's in real time.
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.340]   By the way, there's Twitter.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.340]   You see on the left there?
[01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:51.340]   Profit negative.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.340]   In fact, we made more money on this show than Twitter did during this time.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:56.340]   I don't have revenue like half a billion dollars in revenue.
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.340]   Facebook.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.340]   But you really see this.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.340]   That's the circle and the profit circle.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.220]   There's Amazon with a tiny little profit.
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:05.860]   Samsung is the only thing that even comes close to Apple.
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:08.340]   I think they're logo can fit on their profit.
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:13.260]   The profits hidden underneath the Amazon logo.
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.780]   I love where does that from, Chad?
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:15.860]   That's a great infographic.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:16.860]   I just really like it.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.820]   This is a good question.
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:19.820]   We got it from here.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.460]   Let me grab the article.
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:22.780]   This business insider article.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:23.780]   It's business insider.
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:29.260]   I believe that the actual visualization was made by someone else.
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:34.020]   Yeah, world play zinc is a website that made the vision.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:37.220]   So you see the clock ticking and you see the actual money coming in.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:38.700]   It's not the time you clicked on it.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.700]   It just starts growing up.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:40.700]   It's really cool.
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.780]   It's amazing.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:48.260]   Some of the things that you think makes a lot of money, like maybe Yahoo or LinkedIn, they've
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.260]   only made 70 bucks.
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:53.420]   Now Apple has made 100,000.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:54.420]   There you go.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.420]   That's a slice of doom, Chad.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:56.420]   That's a slice of doom.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:59.860]   What's interesting also is that you look at it and the ones that you wouldn't necessarily
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:04.140]   expect like Apple and Microsoft being the two that are making the most profit.
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.980]   Yeah, profit wise.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.260]   Which one is Microsoft, that green one on the left?
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:13.140]   But you really do see how strong Samsung is in this.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.980]   Now is that Samsung mobile or is that all of Samsung?
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:18.420]   Because they also sell for traders, old low-sings.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:19.420]   Everything.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.660]   So it's oil drills.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:23.740]   There's a sources thing.
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:27.340]   So if I click on Samsung, it'll probably take me to an article.
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.340]   Nicely done.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:32.860]   I like, I'm not a big fan of Infographics in general, but there you go.
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:38.780]   Very big, quarterly profit of $10 billion for Apple.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:39.780]   That's nice when you say it.
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:41.780]   Three months would make $10 billion.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:49.300]   And they pay off, how much did they actually did, you know, buybacks and stock and dividends
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.300]   more than that?
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:55.740]   Now the cumulative payments, $66 billion buybacks.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:56.740]   Right.
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:57.740]   And buybacks and dividends.
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:58.740]   I think dividends have been a small percentage.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:02.220]   I think most of this buybacks because literally at the rate that they're buying back, if they
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.220]   can't continue.
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:07.340]   They return $21 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases during the March quarter,
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:12.340]   $21 billion in one quarter, $7 billion a month in buybacks.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.660]   And they won't continue at that pace, but if they did, by 2020, I think 2024, there'd
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.660]   be no stock.
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:21.020]   That number by itself is why you see Apple stock going through the roof.
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.740]   It is a good buy if you're getting that kind of dividend and buyback.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.260]   And they're going to accelerate the dividends too, they said.
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:32.540]   The only at all cloud, and you kind of, you gave Tim Cook's explanation anyway, Renee.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.420]   Dark cloud is the is the iPad sales.
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:42.380]   iPhones went from 38 million this time last year to 43.7 million.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:45.220]   Max went from four to 4.1 million.
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:51.300]   iPods dropped, of course, but nobody expects iPods to do very well.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:56.540]   The big change though was iPads.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:16:00.020]   And they dropped, but you're saying, Renee, that's because of supply issues and they
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.900]   dropped, but they didn't, they didn't drop.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:06.260]   I think if you look at it, just the pure numbers, it was just over 10%, 13% or 18% or
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.260]   something.
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:11.020]   But when you adjust based on the supply chain and the metrics that Tim Cook announced, it
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:15.300]   ends up being negative 3%, which is kind of flat, which is a cost to panic for some people
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:19.500]   because some people's entire value system is predicated on future growth and non-current
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.060]   profitability.
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:25.260]   But the tablet market in general is interesting and Andy mentioned earlier, would you buy
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.020]   an iPad versus a Mac?
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:31.140]   And there's absolutely people for whom traditional computers are inaccessible and intimidating
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:35.260]   and they will always go towards the iOS solution or the iPad solution.
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:39.260]   But if you look across the board, if you look at Android sales, yes, the incredibly dumb
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:44.420]   tablets that are only used as video players or skyrocketing, the $50, $100 tablets, but
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.580]   the premium tablet market is sort of flat right now.
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.300]   And I don't know if Apple's going to have to evolve the platform more to increase that
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.820]   or if they just accelerated.
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:59.540]   And again, he said they sold 210 million since, since 2010, faster than the iPhone,
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:03.060]   seven times faster than the iPod, if they just reach sort of the current limits of that
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.380]   market much faster than they anticipated.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:12.340]   Well, and what I find interesting in the airport is the fact that most of the people that I
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:17.420]   see using iPads heavily are people that are actually older than I am.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:21.820]   I think I'm in the age of the people that are significantly younger than I am and a little
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:24.940]   bit older than I am or the ones that I see iPads with all the time that folks in my age
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:29.380]   range are still, most of the time I feel like we're still opening up laptops and typing
[01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:30.380]   away.
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:34.820]   I think it's just the, there's a certain cultural process.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:40.900]   The other thing, and this is from Benedict Evans' blog, he makes a point, and I think I agree
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:48.060]   with this, that it's not, I think that it's not so much that people are transitioning
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.700]   or they're they saturated.
[01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:53.340]   It's that the phone is really becoming the computer.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:57.780]   It's not even, it's, we're not only in a post PC or era, we might be in a post tablet
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:58.780]   era soon.
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:17:59.780]   I use my phone.
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.780]   The phone is the computer.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.780]   50 times more than my iPad.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.780]   And that's, yeah.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.380]   And that, I mean, look at saying the iPhones.
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:07.380]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.660]   Look at, I mean, you want big, I just, I thought I'd bring this buy for show and tell.
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.980]   So this is a Windows phone.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:13.980]   This is the Nokia.
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:14.980]   Oh, you got it?
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:15.980]   Yeah, the 1520.
[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:21.140]   Six inch phone, which looks, looks a little funny when you're, now it's such a good screen
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:26.580]   that you have little icons and so forth are really quite usable.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.580]   But it looks a little big by your, by your head.
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.700]   But on the other hand, this is an all purpose device.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.700]   It's no longer just.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:33.700]   Right.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:40.140]   So I mean, this is a little busy, but this is, that's the front screen is all these tiles
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:43.220]   and things are happening and data and so forth.
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.820]   I would maybe nervous if I slept.
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.380]   Well, that's because I've set it up this way.
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:48.380]   It doesn't have to look this way.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.540]   I turn those all off.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:54.020]   But I liked, I mean, it's just the way I like it, but it doesn't really matter.
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:59.620]   The point is that these, this thing is very small, thin wise, I mean, and very, it means
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:00.900]   compact.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:05.900]   But yet a six inch screen, and by the way, it does Siri now style speech.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.180]   This is the 8.1 update, which will be available.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.180]   Cortana.
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:10.180]   Cortana.
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:11.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.380]   Excellent 20 megapixel camera.
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:15.540]   This is this device.
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:18.720]   If it only had better apps, that's what's the failing on Windows phone is really the
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.380]   app ecosystem's terrible, especially if you live in Google.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.660]   I mean, I use Google account.
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:24.660]   There's no G plus on this.
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.140]   There's no Google voice.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:30.700]   And then the apps that you do use when you compare them to the iOS versions, I just
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.260]   have to be a little bit more authentic.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:35.020]   So, you know, that's really where it suffers.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.500]   But in every other respect, yeah, gorgeous hardware, the car.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:42.020]   It makes you think boy Apple could really do well with it.
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.420]   Some somewhat bigger phone.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:48.060]   I mean, I've been walking around with the Nexus 7 for a while to re-familiarize myself
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:54.020]   for the differences between the 7 and the Mac mini, Mac, excuse me, iPad mini.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:58.180]   And just the, I left the house this morning for breakfast.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:01.860]   And the fact that this I could actually slip inside my pocket means that I didn't have
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:08.020]   to take any sort of a bag or anything to carry my minimal need to get in touch, need
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:11.500]   to be able to write things sort of thing was such a big deal.
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:17.460]   I think that the trend has certainly been to go from the 9.7 down to a mini size.
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:21.260]   And now I think there's going to be a little bit more interest in creating devices like
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:26.460]   the 1520 that aren't being sold as phones, but they're sold as the device that you check
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.260]   your bank, you deposit your checks on, you do your banking on, you do all your communications
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:36.700]   with, and you get most of your, so much entertainment from it's hard for us to contemplate the
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:39.900]   idea of not needing or wanting at least a notebook computer.
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:44.060]   But I can't tell you the number of times over the past year, I've talked to people who
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:48.580]   are just like, well, I do, well, I've been able to recommend a Chromebook to because they
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:51.180]   want a recommendation on notebook and ask, well, what do you do with it?
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.180]   So well, practically nothing.
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.740]   I do almost everything on my phone now.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:58.020]   And when that happens, I think, well, why are you spending more than, why do you, why are
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:02.300]   you buying anything more than just a keyboard and a screen if that's really all you're doing
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.300]   with it?
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:08.340]   I love this graph from Ben's blog where he compares quarterly unit shipments for the
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:12.980]   black line is PCs, the yellow line is iPhone and Android smartphones.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:16.540]   So really the, I mean, talk about the lines crossing.
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:20.220]   And I have to, I think I agree with his conclusion that not that there's anything wrong with
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:24.900]   the iPad, it's still totally dominant tablet, but that I think people are finding the phone
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:25.900]   is enough.
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:26.900]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.900]   Phone is what you want.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:33.100]   You use, I use the, I use my phone probably two to three times more than I use it.
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:34.540]   Become your primary computing device.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:35.700]   It's the primary computing device.
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.900]   And I do think that that's what's happening.
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:41.540]   I find that's why you'll probably get a, that's why you'll probably get a bigger one next
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:43.100]   year, maybe a bigger one still the year after.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.100]   No, I don't know.
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:48.660]   In fact, then a 13 inch one, then a 13 inch with a keyboard.
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.740]   If things go like Benedict evidence, Ben Thompson, a lot of really smart people have written really
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.900]   smart things about this.
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:56.940]   And in a world where the primary computing device becomes a phone, as long as there's
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:00.580]   phone.app somewhere on it, you know, Merlin said that he doesn't use his phone as a phone.
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:05.020]   I certainly, I get upset when my phone rings and interrupts me from using my internet communicator,
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:09.780]   I would be fine with a larger screen that had phone.app buried on it somewhere because
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.460]   it would help me in so many other ways.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:15.340]   And when that becomes your primary computing platform, it also liberates the tablet.
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:18.300]   It doesn't have to be a sort of in between device anymore.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:23.060]   And that's where you might get rumors about 12 inch, you know, MacBook Airs or 12 inch
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:28.940]   iPad Pros where they can sort of take on a little bit, not a truck job, like an SUV,
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:31.700]   sort of a job and let the phone really become the car.
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:35.660]   Well, and I would love to be able to have my phone, you know, come home and have a keyboard
[01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:39.660]   and a screen and have my phone sync to that.
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:42.020]   You know, like, you know, like have that all just pop up on a screen.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.860]   That's kind of what Renee's talking about, right, Renee?
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:49.700]   I just think like an iPhone Duo doc, you'd come in and yeah.
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:51.660]   Do you make those for Android?
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.380]   There are a lot of Android devices that doc.
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:57.260]   When you think about Bluetooth and AirPlay, you could almost have an iPhone and you'd come
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.540]   into the room and you just sit down and start typing and it shows up.
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.100]   But that's kind of your vision, right, Renee?
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.820]   Is that you, one device, but different screens or?
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:04.820]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:07.820]   I mean, you know, Torsten Heinz from BlackBerry said it's a long time ago and he got laughed
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.660]   at, but I think it's because he was misunderstood.
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:13.840]   But it makes a lot of sense in the future when you have such powerful cloud side computing
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.700]   that you basically choose the size of screen that you need for a certain task and your
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.300]   environment is just there.
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.980]   You shouldn't have to worry about moving things back and forth.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:24.140]   You should just get home and what you want is on your TV.
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.540]   You should leave the house and what you want is on your phone.
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:30.380]   You should get to, you know, your, your meeting and what you need should be on your tablet.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:32.780]   That shouldn't have to be a human manageable problem anymore.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:33.780]   We're there.
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:34.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:37.300]   Apple's uniquely positioned to provide that for their own products, I think within the
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.100]   next five, five years.
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:42.380]   Clearly, that's what Apple's doing with the I work updates.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:45.040]   Microsoft's doing with Office 365.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:49.480]   And I think it's really Google that did it first with Google Docs.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:54.720]   And I think it makes perfect sense that I don't need to store anything locally or much
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.280]   locally because everything is kind of always available for me.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.280]   There's a difference though.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.000]   The difference in Apple's mentality is they don't like the Google approach where everything
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.160]   is processed on the server.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.700]   They don't want to take that responsibility for your data.
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.680]   So I think in their vision, you, your device is still private.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.920]   You can just choose what you want to share and what you want to move back and forth.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.160]   And they'll have as little controller contact with that as possible.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.320]   I think that may bite him in the butt.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:21.640]   Yeah, I found there's some, the setup that they've had with I work is a little cumbersome.
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:28.240]   I mean, we use a lot of Google Docs and trying to play with going over has been.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:33.800]   I think some people care a lot about where their data lives, but most people do not.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.520]   And the vast majority of people, the convenience of just having it all there.
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:39.520]   Oh, wow.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.200]   I'm just convenience this productivity.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.120]   I mean, we have, you know, we'll have people working on a project and then being able to
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.040]   get into all that data and move around and deal with it is not just a, yeah, it's a big
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.040]   deal.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.320]   And Apple may have paid themselves into a corner because now they are the, they are
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.680]   the company, the one, the only company that protects your privacy.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.840]   I guess Microsoft's trying to position themselves that way.
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:58.840]   It's not very credible.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.960]   But the, the, the other limitation of all this is that one of the great things about
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:08.800]   Google services is that it makes the device in your hand largely irrelevant and the features
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.040]   of it largely irrelevant.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040]   It doesn't matter.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.040]   This doesn't have quite so much storage.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:16.320]   It doesn't even matter so much that the camera in your Android phone is not the best in the
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:22.360]   world because it automatically syncs to your photo library on Google+, your Google+ library
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:27.280]   to automatically uses all this, all this software they've licensed to cook up that, that photo
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.760]   to make it look like you shot it with a much, much better camera.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:33.280]   Even if you're not sharing with anybody, by the time you go to Google+ to look at these
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:37.320]   photos that have already been, are automatically been synced, you might find that the photos
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.080]   you synced from your really, really cheap $150 Android phone with a camera that doesn't
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.120]   work very well, those photos look just about as good as what you get on an iPhone 5S because
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.160]   these were cooked better than the, as, as well as the onboard processor on the 5S.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.440]   So there, there are a lot of different solutions to this problem and there's glad there's
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.760]   so many different companies are approaching from so many different solutions.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:00.160]   I think there's a lag to in our perception.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.720]   We still think about, well, this phone doesn't have enough memory or this computer doesn't
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:06.120]   have enough memory and when it's no longer relevant.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.000]   We still think, oh, what happens if the cloud goes down?
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.920]   When it's not really an issue anymore, but we have these kind of memories that we forget
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.400]   or we don't forget what, how it used to be.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.360]   And I still go down once in a while.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.360]   But that's good.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.640]   But in our, in our, in our, in our office, we get more reliable, not lesser.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.640]   Oh, I agree.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:24.840]   But I, I know that Google went down a couple months ago and it was like mass pandemonium
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.840]   in our office.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.280]   I mean, it was like, you know, there's like, there's like 15 people panicking.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.720]   People in the chair are saying, well, what happens when the cloud goes down or what happens
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.720]   when they lose your data?
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.120]   It's not going to happen.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.120]   It's going to happen less and less.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.120]   Yeah, less and less.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.240]   That's that's alien attack sort of situation, in which case you have better problems on your
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:42.600]   hands than I can't get at my Google Docs today.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.600]   Merlin, you're quiet.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.360]   Well, how do you, now you're the, you're the guy, the productivity king, which is ironic
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.320]   because you really don't do anything anymore.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.320]   Which one am I?
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.320]   The king of fraud.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.320]   That's ultimate productivity.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.320]   That's right.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.320]   You figured it out.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:55.320]   So you don't have listening.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:59.880]   I'm listening, listening and thinking about all of it.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.520]   The cloud stuff is still a little bit of a conundrum for me because all I use is Apple
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.520]   stuff.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:08.200]   I don't feel at all qualified to talk about anything other than Apple stuff.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:13.000]   But I still find it kind of frustrating sometimes getting my hands around exactly where my data
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   is, what I can do with it.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.560]   And in the case of some recent problems I've been having with my iPhone, I feel more and
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.360]   more frustrated sometimes about not having the kind of access I used to have to being
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.000]   able to troubleshoot a problem and figure out what's going on with it.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.200]   And so I think I agree that for most people, they're getting more comfortable with the idea
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:33.960]   of cloud stuff.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:40.320]   But it also for somebody like me, that means more and more little bits of friction.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.440]   Having to make sure when you talk about the cloud never going away, well, I don't know
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.160]   if you travel.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:50.080]   But when I'm someplace else and all I have is for example, what comes to mind is trying
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.240]   to find wireless in New Zealand was rough.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:57.560]   And I end up spending so much money on a data, extra data and stuff like that.
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.240]   So there's those kinds of issues.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:04.280]   There's also things like just, I don't think most people, this is the topic that comes
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:09.480]   up a lot on things like the prompt and things like the accidental tech podcast.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.840]   Like I don't think most garden variety people, I'm guessing really have their hands around
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.200]   photo management in the Apple ecosystem.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:22.440]   And I think they either don't know, they're either screwed or they don't know they're
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:26.480]   screwed and they haven't figured out what to do about it because it's really complicated
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.480]   problem to take care of.
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:32.000]   But that's where Google is stepping right in and saying, okay, we'll do it automatically
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.680]   and Google plus.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.000]   Do you use that for your photos?
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.800]   No, I don't use Google plus.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.320]   You got to try it because maybe it's going away.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.320]   I don't know.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.840]   But it really, that's exactly what Google said.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.840]   People have lost control.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:45.840]   So we will do it.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:52.360]   As good as cloud stuff gets, there's still going to be some part of me.
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.240]   It's going to wonder like who's, you know, who watches the watchman, right?
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.480]   Who's backing up the cloud?
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.920]   Where I still feel the need to do these backups and offsite rotations with drives and stuff
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.720]   like that.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.200]   And I guess it's a funny thing.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.440]   Like when there was the, this is not fun.
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.720]   I don't mean this is fun.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.680]   But you look at something like the dot Mac days, you look at things like the Dropbox
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.160]   password, kerfluffle, all these kinds of things that can happen.
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.280]   And I think it doesn't take that happening.
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:22.560]   The more we use these services, the less it needs to happen in order to give us the fear.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:26.360]   And as we get more comfortable using that and putting more stuff into it, that makes
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:30.040]   me more and more anxious in some ways about knowing I've got it all backed up.
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.600]   I've known I've got it encrypted, knowing I've got it in multiple places that used to
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.400]   feel like annoying.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.640]   It was all just on this drive in the same way that it was annoying to use a haze modem
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.680]   to get on the internet and check my email.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:45.200]   But that having that only one place gave a kind of comfort that I wasn't really even
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:46.200]   aware of at the time.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.080]   But now I feel like where is my stuff like.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.080]   That's so funny.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:54.520]   I feel completely the opposite because I have Dropbox, OneDrive, Google+, and iPhoto all
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.520]   backing up my images.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.520]   I have it on four different clouds.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.680]   I feel safer than I ever have.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:03.640]   And I have to admit with my with my own job, my own personal data, I'm really sensitive
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:06.720]   to the fact I travel a lot and I'm I have my bag around a lot.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.920]   And what I've actually started doing is getting rid of mail on a lot of my laptops because
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.280]   I don't want anything.
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:15.120]   I don't want any data, especially on my little air.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.880]   I don't keep any data on it at all.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:20.320]   I mean, local data other than just little bits and pieces of things that I'm working on.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:25.000]   I like the fact that I can do things offline, but but I don't keep my mail on it.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.080]   I don't keep anything that has passwords on it.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.200]   It's kind of like this thing that I can take out.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.840]   And if someone steals it, what I'm more worried about is my data now being planted on a machine.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.800]   That's the thing that keeps me up more than than someone stealing my data in the cloud.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.320]   Maybe that's inverted from what it should be, but that I know that that's what goes in my
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.320]   head all the time.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:48.640]   I trust the cloud and I know that in the back of my mind, I have this feeling maybe I'm walking
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:52.200]   merrily down the primrose lane to utter disaster.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.200]   But I think that's highly unlikely.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.080]   And that my rational mind says this is absolutely the future.
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.440]   And we're a lot about passwords.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.440]   You know what I mean?
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:03.120]   I mean, I think that we're losing pictures of my butt up there.
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.040]   No, no, I'm talking about that.
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.040]   Nothing.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:09.680]   I'm talking about when we talk about mail and we talk about the stuff that we put on the
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:13.280]   cloud of someone being able to hack into that and then being able to get enough information
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.760]   to hack into a lot of other things.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:16.760]   Well, take steps.
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:17.760]   Oh, I do.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.160]   I mean, that's why I have last class.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.000]   That's why I have, you know, that's why I pay a question.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000]   Questions from the audience.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   Let's do our question thing.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000]   Questions from the audience.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.520]   This is from Sam Harrelson from Columbia, South Carolina.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:32.520]   He said, "How will a Siri evolve at WWDC to compete with Cortana and Google Now?"
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.840]   Or will it?
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.800]   It seems Apple's let Siri lag a little.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.000]   There's a lot of competition.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   I think they're just subtle.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.520]   I don't think there's anything they're doing that's saying Siri version two.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:45.560]   I think they're just constantly working on it.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.560]   Okay.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.560]   There we go.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.560]   We're going to do the lightning round here.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.560]   Okay.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.520]   This is from Andre in San Francisco.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:59.360]   What has been the defining moment after 400 episodes of Mac Break Weekly?
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.360]   So many.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360]   I think Leo was last.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.360]   I think Leo was last.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.360]   Andre's laptop.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.360]   Thank you, right.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.560]   Me pouring water in my laptop?
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.560]   No, no.
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.240]   It's you with your laptop with Steve Jobs giving you the evil giving you the stink guy.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.240]   Yeah, that's what I'm going to go on.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.240]   No one will ever forget.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.400]   That was because it changed the iPad announcement.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:18.040]   We haven't seen an invite since 2010.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:21.760]   I think of Merlin Mann and the King of the Rat Hole playing the guitar.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.560]   I think of Andy playing the ukulele.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:26.760]   We've had some fine musical moments on this show.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:32.960]   I think of Becky Worley stepping up to Steve Jobs and asking him question on FaceTime saying
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:38.400]   when is when our FaceTime protocol is going to go open like you promised.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:41.400]   And brushing her ass like enough.
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.400]   No.
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:44.400]   You want questions?
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:47.240]   There've been many great moments.
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:49.240]   So Scott born with his iPhone vest.
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.240]   Yes.
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:51.880]   I think that was a Merlin Mann trope.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:52.880]   All right.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:53.880]   Another question.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.880]   Is Yacht wax?
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.880]   Yacht wax?
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:56.880]   Who could forget his Yacht?
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:57.880]   Scott Bouldard.
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.880]   Yacht wax.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.080]   Your Swiss ball break on Mac break weekly.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.080]   Leo, is that a different show?
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:02.480]   I don't remember that one.
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.320]   I think it was a different show.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.600]   That would have been a moment though, wouldn't it?
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.360]   This show has always been so much fun.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:12.200]   And thanks so much to people like Merlin.
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:17.200]   I'm so glad to see you again and Andy and not go to our founding member.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.680]   And the guy who created Mac break, Alex Lindsay.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.880]   And to the new kids, Renee Richie.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.640]   And that's it.
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.640]   Just you.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.080]   The new kid.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.080]   Any other questions?
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:34.080]   I think we picked a really good show to end on.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.240]   I'm glad that we're ending it before we start going through that downhill thing.
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:41.840]   And before there's all these rumors about yes, I don't want to cut you off Andy.
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.840]   But this is a nation.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:46.800]   This is a nation and an industry that the fears are genius.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.840]   This is an industry that is scared of brilliance.
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.080]   And I want to say Andy and not go as I sit here with you today, it is nice to be with
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.840]   the genius that is what I'm going to say about that.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.160]   This is an industry that is full of fear.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.440]   It is not what a triangle thinks.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.680]   This is the show that made Jerry Lewis the star he is today.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:03.160]   I'm proud to say.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.720]   We told JJ Abrams reboots this thing.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:11.080]   Let me tell you, Merlin, when I got my invitation to be a panel on this showman, all I wanted
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:16.960]   to know is Tuxedo or Deschiki and what time because to be on a stage with Merlin man
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:24.520]   is to know you have arrived in this industry because you do not suffer fools, Merlin man.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:29.080]   This is a time when I'm going to speak from what I call my heart.
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:33.520]   When you have an Andy and not go, there is no can that can hold that genius.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:35.960]   Okay, that's number one.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.760]   The opener for that can is love.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.760]   It is.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:42.760]   It's beautiful.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.680]   Oh my God.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:46.480]   Any other questions?
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.680]   But we don't get to do our medley, Leo.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.680]   Yes.
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:52.680]   That's a whole lot.
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:53.680]   That's a lot.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:54.680]   Lovely.
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.680]   Alone.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.360]   You know, I think what the world needs now is love.
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.760]   And what kind of love?
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.760]   Sweet.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.760]   Sweet.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.760]   Love.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.760]   Sweet.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:04.760]   Knowledge.
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:05.760]   Next question.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:06.760]   Oh, cool.
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.760]   So adorable.
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.760]   You keep trying to keep this on focus, Alex.
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:09.760]   Go ahead and join the best I can.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:10.760]   Next issue.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.760]   Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.760]   Issue three.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:15.760]   Issue three.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:16.760]   Next question.
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:17.760]   Question.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.760]   Will the Apple TV get an SDK and W.C.
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:22.760]   Never.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:23.760]   I say apple sauce.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.760]   It's not going to happen.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.760]   Apple sauce.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:26.760]   That's right.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.760]   All right.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.760]   Anybody, anybody think otherwise?
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.760]   I think so.
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:31.760]   I think it's time.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:32.760]   It's time, but it's not going to happen.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.760]   I don't see it happening.
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:34.760]   No, I mean, they've had it for a while.
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.760]   They just got to release that beast.
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.760]   Put it out there.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:37.760]   Do it.
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:38.760]   It's internal use only.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:40.760]   I think they're going to open it up.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:41.760]   Split up the bench.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.760]   You'll split on that.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.760]   Will they open up the gym?
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.760]   Yes.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:46.760]   Without change in the interface?
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.760]   Maybe.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.760]   They'll change the interface too.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:49.760]   Geez, Louise.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.760]   All I can say is games on Apple TV.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:52.760]   Game over.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:53.760]   Never going to happen.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.760]   It's the same thing.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:01.760]   When you look at the talent that's been assembled for the Apple TV over the last year, there's a ridiculous amount of amazing engineers and they're not working on keeping it the same.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:03.760]   Wrong.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.760]   All right.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.760]   Okay.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.760]   That's good.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.760]   I like that debate.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.760]   I'm going to June for a WWE.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:15.760]   Next question, Jim M from San Diego says, "Do you guys think these will be enabled for WWE?
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:20.760]   Air drop between iPhone and a max access to series API within apps?"
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.760]   Yes and no.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:22.760]   Yes and no.
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:23.760]   Yes and no.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:24.760]   All right.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.760]   One more because we're almost at it.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.760]   All right.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:28.760]   Last one.
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.760]   It's got something pointing sharp coming at him.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:31.760]   Oh.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:32.760]   That's all.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.760]   It's a size of a pencil.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.760]   Oh, try it pencil.
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:37.760]   We're short.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:38.760]   We're short.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:39.760]   We're final.
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.760]   God bless it.
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:41.760]   I know.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:42.760]   First question.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:43.760]   That's what I got.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:47.760]   Leo, how much of the things you order online do you ever use?
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.760]   That's an unfair question.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.760]   I buy them for you.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:52.760]   That's a very personal question.
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:53.760]   I use them all.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.760]   Actually, at least once.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:56.760]   I bought.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:58.760]   I mean, well, like this is a good example.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.760]   This is a Nokia 1520.
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.760]   I feel like I have to understand Windows Phone and use it.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.680]   I was hopeful that it would be that I would have some revelation that says, oh my God,
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.800]   they finally did it right.
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.600]   And they're very close, but you know, Google screwed him because Google has not played
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.600]   along.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:17.800]   And the lack of Google services on this for me anyway, because I'm so invested in Google
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:18.960]   is a problem.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.200]   So not evil.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.720]   There are evil in this respect.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.000]   They've really, but you know what Microsoft started it with scruggled.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.160]   This is, I believe, a direct response to scruggled.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.160]   Yes.
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.080]   You want more?
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.080]   One more.
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.080]   All right.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:37.080]   This is from Allen in DMV.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.960]   I don't know where that is.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:42.160]   Can we get a status update on how Apple's doing on their attempts to improve their cloud
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.160]   services?
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.160]   We kind of talked about that already.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160]   They're doing better.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.720]   We started voting to announce like chaotic.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.880]   So they're working on it.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:53.920]   Our services have not actively killed anybody yet.
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:55.440]   So what's called a win?
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.000]   In Apple terms, that's a win.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.440]   And gave it to the camera on the body.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.360]   All right, we have a few minutes left before security now.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.720]   Steve Gibson is waiting in the wings.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.400]   So I would love to do pics.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.400]   We in Renee.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:09.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.840]   Show me that picture one more time because we didn't go through this.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:18.040]   So this is a modern picture, despite the black and white of, is it a table read?
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.680]   What is going on here, Andy and I don't know.
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.240]   I just taught myself, but look, everyone seems to have a bound script or something in their
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:25.240]   laps.
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:26.640]   It seems to be the same document in their laps.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.760]   Is that JJ Abrams talking to Indiana Jones?
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.560]   It does look like it.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.480]   Okay, so we know he's the director.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.720]   It does look like a script reading.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:41.240]   Andy Serkis, Colin from Lord of the Rings is there.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.040]   Okay, but now Andy never plays a real person.
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.560]   He always plays a humongous.
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:48.040]   He's pretty cool.
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.040]   He's pretty cool.
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.040]   He's done stuff.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.040]   Has he?
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.040]   He was in the Gilbert and Sullivan movie.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.040]   Okay.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.040]   He was in a...
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.040]   I must have missed that.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:57.040]   He's a pants.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.600]   Like the tightest pants imaginable.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.800]   But he was the gorilla in the second, the planet of the Apes movie.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:06.480]   He was of course, Colin.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:10.400]   That makes me think there might be a humongous type.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.400]   Charge our Smeagol.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.400]   Charge our Smeagol.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.400]   My Precious.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:16.400]   You still my S me.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.160]   So, so what else is in there?
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.880]   Who else do we see?
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:22.880]   Mark Hamill.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:23.880]   That's Mark Hamill there.
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.240]   He's got leaning in on the plaid shirt to talk to a gentleman.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.440]   Harry Fisher?
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.440]   Harry Fisher?
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.440]   Harry Fisher.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:30.440]   Where's Carrie Fisher?
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:33.920]   It's amazing how absolutely 1970s this photo.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:37.860]   Doesn't it feel like like furniture, clothes people are wearing.
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:41.320]   There is not a computer that I can see?
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.320]   That's an interesting point.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:46.440]   But there is an R2-D2 in a crate.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.440]   Just cracks me up.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.440]   Oh, and Max von Cydal, Leo.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.440]   I'm wondering if that's a smart one.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.440]   Where's Max von Cydal?
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.440]   I love him.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.440]   He would be the new Obi-Wan Kenobi type.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:57.720]   Oh, that's who the back is turned to.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.880]   He was in the Bob and Doug Mackenzie movie as the big bad guy.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:04.240]   That is quite a good get.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.800]   And George Lucas has no script writing credit that we can find.
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:10.120]   And I don't even, yeah, but this is what puzzled me because I looked at this for a long time
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.880]   looking for George Lucas.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.440]   I'm wondering if that's the Lucasfilm archives.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.240]   That's where you'd have a box of R2-D2.
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.200]   Peter Sarah Finowitz posted a picture from, claiming to be from London yesterday.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.040]   You know, Peter Sarah Finowitz was the voice of Darth Maul.
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.160]   And he posted a picture of him with Mark Hamley yesterday.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.120]   So I'm going to guess this is London.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.200]   London, where they shoot.
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:36.880]   There's the set for most of the Star Wars movies is in England.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:41.080]   I think it's interesting that not only is there no laptops, there's no cell phones.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.840]   Do you think that they said, "Leave your cell phone at the door?"
[01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.320]   Yeah, they don't want any selfie scripts showing up.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.040]   Rare you'd get a group of that many people together and one of them is not staring at
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:51.040]   his phone.
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:54.480]   I went out, Leo, it's 2014 and I still can't buy Star Wars on iTunes.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.760]   Well, that's a good problem.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.120]   There's Starbucks on the table.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.320]   Ah, that does give the day to way.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.200]   Very interesting.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.560]   That's exciting.
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:06.880]   Mr. Renee Rich, what?
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:07.880]   Look, see?
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.200]   Starbucks on the table.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.480]   There we hope a game.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:16.320]   I went through this before the prequels, but oh my God, they're doing a noob, okay.
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:19.440]   My heart hasn't broken so many times.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.800]   I don't say the heart is much like a wheel.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.560]   Once you bend it, you can't bend it.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.560]   It's J.J. Abrams.
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.560]   It's going to be great.
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:25.560]   Lend's lair.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.360]   There's going to be a box inside of a box inside of Star Wars.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:31.560]   Merlin, is that a fantastic Ford T-shirt?
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.560]   Awesome.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.760]   I didn't know this before.
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.520]   Burn era, fantastic Ford too.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:38.520]   I approve.
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:41.960]   My pick of the week is Merlin's T-shirt.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:44.240]   I'm Sue Storm.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.400]   I'm just not very good at it.
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:47.240]   I always wonder what happened to Franklin Richards.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:48.240]   Okay.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:49.240]   Give me a pick.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.840]   You're going to have one sentence each to do your pick.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.840]   Mr. Renee Richie.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:54.840]   Foldify Zoo.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.360]   It's the same great Foldify app for the iPad, but now you can make and produce animals
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.640]   in the real world as well.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:00.640]   It's delightful.
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:01.960]   We talked about it on an iPad today.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.960]   It was Sarah Lane's pick.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:03.960]   I agree.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.960]   Really cool.
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:08.120]   Just search for it on the App Store for the iPad.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:10.120]   Foldify, F-O-L-D-I-F-Y.
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:11.120]   Zoo.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.520]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, you got to pick something less than an Alex?
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.520]   Oh yeah.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.200]   By the way, I think the unit of the Alex was also created by the Merlin Man.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.200]   I believe.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.200]   That's $700.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:22.200]   Yes.
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.200]   See?
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.200]   Yep.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.200]   It is Tempo.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.200]   Have you seen Tempo?
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.200]   No.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.200]   Oh.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:29.200]   Is it an app?
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.200]   Oh.
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.200]   That's all I got to say.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:34.680]   So Tempo is an app for your iPhone and what it does, it's a calendar app.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:35.680]   But here's what it does.
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:36.920]   It does one thing that's really important.
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:40.480]   I'm on five or six conference calls a day.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:44.800]   What drives me absolutely nuts is having to type in the code.
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.000]   You hit the thing and you call and then you remember what the code is and you can't
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.160]   see the code and you can't see the code on your iPhone and then you have to go to the
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:55.040]   other one and then you're like, and then like nine digits long.
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.520]   No one should make one longer than five.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:03.160]   Anyway, so anyway, so what Tempo does is you'll see your next meeting and it just looks
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:07.840]   like I-Cal there but you click on your next meeting there and one of the cool things that
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:12.960]   it provides for is when you click on the call, it actually, you can hit dial.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:16.400]   So what you do is you hit the call and when you're in the call, you push that dial again
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.120]   and it on and it dials in.
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.280]   That alone makes it worth the price.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:26.560]   And I literally transformed my like calling in thing overnight.
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.880]   So anyway, it's also gorgeous.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:33.720]   I mean, it's a really pretty but that's the only thing that I really need to just do.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:37.880]   So it's pretty slick.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.200]   I believe there is an iPad version.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.600]   Am I wrong?
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:44.640]   I seem to remember there's an iPad version of that.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:45.640]   Why?
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:46.880]   Well, I'm sorry, it's an iPad.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.440]   It wouldn't be able to call.
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.280]   Oh, maybe you're right.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.960]   FaceTime, you're right.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:54.560]   I also didn't know my mic was needed.
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:55.560]   You said why?
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:56.560]   It's like why?
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:01.480]   I don't really need to say look forward again, Leo, with a stupid comment.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:03.640]   Oh, my mic's on.
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.040]   All right.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:06.200]   I stand corrected.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.240]   And I think it's free.
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:09.240]   I don't know why it's free.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:11.160]   I'm waiting for something to go wrong or something.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:12.800]   I have an app or something, but it's great.
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.640]   It's Tempo and you should get it.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.480]   You have to get it.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:17.840]   So pick of the week, sir.
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.720]   To save time, I'm not going to run into the other room to get the thing that I was planning
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:21.720]   to do.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.400]   But since this is a comics theme episode, I'm going to recommend Bandette, a comic by
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.600]   Paul Tobin and Colleen Coover, which is one of my favorite new comics of the past year
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.840]   to imagine the short pitches.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:37.960]   Imagine a movie starring Audrey Hepburn in 1959, starring her as a Parisian bandit.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:38.960]   And that's it.
[01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:39.960]   It's an all-aid.
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:42.880]   The entire thing is braided G. There's like maybe two panels in the entire series so
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.840]   far that are braided PG.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:45.840]   It's charming.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.280]   The art is fantastic.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.160]   The characterization is spot on.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:52.600]   There are seven issues so far and each issue is only 99 cents of comicsology.
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.600]   Very high recommendation.
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:56.280]   Merlin, did you want to pick something?
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:57.280]   Yes.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:59.360]   I love my Apple TV.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:03.760]   Apple TV, if you have things that you're from your personal collection, that you have
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:08.160]   locally, you could go and put them into iTunes on your Mac and then stream them from there.
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:11.120]   But that's kind of a pain and it won't work if it's not in the right encoding.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:15.120]   And I've called Beemer, which is available at beemer-app.com.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:17.640]   You buy this thing, you download it, you drop any file onto it.
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:20.640]   It could be an AVI and MKV.
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:23.800]   Any of those, you drop them on there and it just sends it straight to your Apple TV and
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:27.160]   you can use your remote like you normally would with the TV.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.560]   It's an evening changer.
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:29.560]   I will put it that way.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:30.560]   It's a great app.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.160]   Beemer at beemer-app.com.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.160]   I don't know what it costs.
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.160]   But who cares?
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.160]   It's worth it.
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.160]   Wow.
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:38.160]   There are others like it.
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:39.160]   But I've had good luck with this.
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:40.800]   It was real simple to use.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.920]   Merlin Mann is at merlinman.com.
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.880]   Two ends in the man.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:48.720]   He's a fabulous back to work show is at 5x5.tv.
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:51.360]   You have other shows there as well, yes?
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.520]   Also tune into RoderickonTheLine at RoderickonTheLine.com.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.920]   John Roderick helps a lot of people.
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:59.920]   And Merlin is glad to help him help people.
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:00.920]   And honestly, thanks a lot.
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:05.360]   Thanks for, you know, every interview I'm on, let me tell you something about a friend.
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:06.360]   [laughter]
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:12.200]   I was trying to be gracious about making sure to mention how grateful I am for all the help
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:13.680]   and breaks you've given me in the past.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:14.680]   No, no need.
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:18.520]   And I just say, no, I don't get any thing for saying that, I don't think.
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.520]   But I really do appreciate that.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.720]   And being on Macrae Weekly was huge for me.
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.880]   It was a wonderful experience.
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:28.160]   And it exposed me to a lot of people for better or for worse.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.160]   And thanks a lot for doing the show.
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:30.160]   I really appreciate it.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.160]   Oh, well, we love you.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.440]   And I'd love to get you back.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.440]   But I know you're busy with this Roderick fellow.
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:37.040]   Well, give me more than half an hour's notice now.
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.040]   Yeah, I will.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.040]   You can shave.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.040]   It's great.
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.040]   No, seriously.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.040]   No, I know.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.040]   You look great, actually.
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:44.880]   You look fabulous.
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:49.880]   And of course, hot dogs ladies on the Twitter.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:52.040]   And you tweet, but not as prolifically as you used to.
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:54.880]   But I see you're kind of tweeting more.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:56.080]   I do things.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.080]   I do things.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.720]   I'm just glad anybody notices me at all.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.720]   Thank you.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:02.520]   Andy and I go Chicago Sun times.
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.240]   Great to have you, as always.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:07.560]   Congratulations on 400 episodes.
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:09.320]   Good luck on at least 80 more.
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:10.720]   We're going to do many, many more.
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.440]   Hopefully more than that.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:15.080]   But I figure if that figure will get to a thousand.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:16.880]   I'll be pissed if it's not 80.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:17.880]   Yes.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:18.880]   480.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:21.720]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, thank you for the question thing.
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:22.720]   We'll do more of that.
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:23.720]   I love that.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:30.240]   And I am doing kind of flash question, ask Alex's almost every day when I'm not traveling.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:34.080]   And if you follow me on Twitter or G+, I'll just Alex Lindsey.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.520]   I just pop up saying, hey, I'm going to do a bunch of question answers.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:37.520]   It's really fun.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:39.280]   We get 20 or 30 people and people just ask questions.
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.240]   And I just go through them as fast as I can.
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.600]   And I will be doing one on green screen either Friday or Monday.
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:48.520]   So I'll put it on my Twitter.
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:49.520]   Literally?
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:50.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.160]   Literally, we've actually been answering them while you have a green screen.
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:56.000]   We'll change with your answers behind you.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000]   Yes.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000]   That's awesome.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000]   I will key myself in front of the question thing.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000]   That says some backgrounds.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000]   That's the question behind me.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.280]   I'll be keyed live in front of the question engine.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:07.120]   And then you'll see random questions behind me.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:09.520]   And I'll turn around and I'll follow.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:14.040]   And Alex, will you ask this tradition when you answer questions like live on streaming,
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:17.880]   be wearing that big, big, frizzy, frizzy wig with their little tiny hairs that are flying
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:18.880]   over?
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:19.880]   It's a really good idea.
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:20.880]   I'll see if I can get one by then.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.880]   That would be awesome.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:25.000]   I'll do the whole thing with like a giant wig.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.520]   I have like an Argyle cat too that you just hold next to you.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:29.520]   Oh, like that.
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.520]   The Argyle hat and the big wig.
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:32.520]   Renee, Richie, imore.com.
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.920]   What you got coming up, Renee?
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:35.920]   Anything to plug?
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:41.400]   Guy English and I on our show, Debug, we hosted a panel about sexism and technology with
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:45.960]   Trinity Caldwell from Macworld, Jesse Char from Pacific Elm, Georgia Dall from Zen and Tech
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:48.640]   and Brianna Wu from Giant Space Cat.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:51.400]   And it turned out, I think, terrifically well, we were really honored that they would do
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.400]   that with us.
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.400]   Really good.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:54.400]   Oh, thank you very good.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:58.480]   Can you just tell serenity we want to hire her away from you?
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.480]   She's not ours.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:00.480]   She's Macworld.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.480]   Oh, that's right.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.480]   You have to fight Jason Snell for her.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.480]   I will.
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.480]   I think technically she's serenity.
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:07.480]   Yeah, she's her own person, technically.
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:09.080]   Yeah, they're all fantastic.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:10.480]   And we've got to transcript up now too.
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:13.280]   So if you can't listen to it, you can read it or have it read to you.
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:19.000]   By the way, Colin Johnson said of this episode, it's my Beatles reunion with the Naco Hot
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.040]   Dogs ladies, LaPorte, Lindsay and Renee Richie as Stu Secliff.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.040]   I like it.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.040]   Nice.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.040]   Thank you, Colin.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.040]   Could have been being fast.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.040]   Could have been far far less complimentary.
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:32.760]   Could have been worse.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:39.960]   This show does its thing every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.200]   on twit.tv.
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:44.720]   You can watch live, but you can always get on demand audio and video after the fact,
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:51.800]   twit.tv/mbw or wherever finer net casters are aggregated for your downloading pleasure.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:57.000]   Don't forget our Twit apps too on iPad, iPhone, and every other device known in my life.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.080]   I'm including the Roku app by Craig Milani of Shifki Software, which is a great way to
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:03.800]   watch on the big screen.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.440]   Chadron's reminding me to plug next week's triangulation on Monday, Pomplamoose joins
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.920]   us to perform and talk about their really amazing YouTube videos.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.480]   Pomplamoose is going to be here?
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:15.480]   You know, they're from Petaluma.
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:16.480]   I know they're from Petaluma.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.480]   Do they live in Petaluma?
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:18.480]   No, they live in the city.
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.480]   I think he used to live in Petaluma, yeah.
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.480]   Oh my gosh.
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:24.880]   I'm definitely going to accidentally be here to try and triangulation.
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:25.880]   Amazing Pomplamoose.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:26.880]   They're going to play too.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:27.880]   Well, I'm hoping in.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:28.880]   Ooh.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:29.880]   Let's see.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.320]   I think that's about it.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.080]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:35.080]   We'll see you next time.
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.000]   Now get back to work because break time is over.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:44.000]   [MUSIC]
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.580]   (upbeat music)
