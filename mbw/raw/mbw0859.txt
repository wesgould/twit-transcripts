[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.960]   He was lead developer on Tumblr back in the day. You might remember his Insta paper and of course
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.120]   he is currently the guy, the one-man guy, one-man band behind the best podcast player out there
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.600]   overcast. He also has a lot to say about the future of podcasting and we're gonna have a lot of fun.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:37.600]   Mac, break weekly is next. Podcasts you love from people you trust. This is Twit.

[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.080]   Of which there is precious little but we'll find something to talk about.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.680]   Actually, there's some good news. Jason Snell is still in Kiwi land.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.360]   New Zealand, so we have brought in a ringer but I'll introduce him in a moment but first
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.480]   Alex Lindsey's here from officehours.global and 090.media.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.120]   Hello, hello, Alex. He was on Twitter on Sunday and you mid-journeyed the title
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.640]   and we used it as a thumbnail. You didn't use the goofy one though.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.040]   There was two that were relatively on point and then there was one that was just completely
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.680]   weird and absurd. I was like, I wonder if they're going to use that one.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.160]   Who edited that? Was that Kevin? Kevin decided to go.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.200]   He went safe. I saw those images. I think it was safer that we went with the
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.000]   John Ashley says it was better that we didn't go with the goofy one.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.600]   Let me just look. Which one was the goofy one?
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.280]   Dog. The dog.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.560]   Here, show it. I got a dog.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.360]   That one? No, no, no, no. Not those. No, no, no.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.560]   That one?
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.000]   That one? Okay.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.960]   Cheerleaders?
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.360]   Like what mean girls?
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.160]   Because the-
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.080]   Oh, that was mean girls. Right. Fetch happens.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.840]   I couldn't quite get one that was perfect. So there was a couple of weird hands and stuff like
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   that. But the dog, the expression on the dog was priceless.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.280]   Okay. Well, we'll use it today.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   No, no, we don't need that.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.400]   That's Marco. I'll make you a new one.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.440]   What the hell are we doing here?
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.640]   Andy Inaco is also with us. Hello, Andrew from WG.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.680]   B.H. Abolst.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.600]   Hey there, Heather Hoelder.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.720]   Good to see you, sir.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.560]   That's always-
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.120]   And our ringer, ladies and gentlemen, if this were a softball team, this would be the
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.440]   slugger, the guy we brought in, the hit it out of the park.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.600]   Jason couldn't be here, but I'm thrilled to have Marco Arment here.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.720]   Marco, good to see you.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.680]   Hello. Good to finally be here again.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.280]   It's been, what, 10 years?
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.080]   Every 700 episodes we have Marco on.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.000]   He was on 702 episodes ago.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.640]   So, well, you know, so let's see.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.080]   This is 800, what is it?
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.760]   892. We'll have you on again.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.920]   And oh my God, it's yours.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.480]   10 years.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.600]   10 years.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.000]   10 years.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.480]   10 years.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.360]   Marco, you know Marco because many of you use his software overcast at overcast.fm.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.440]   That's easily the best podcast software out there, except it doesn't do video.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.440]   So for us, a lot of our users do use something else because they want the video.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.880]   Are you going to have video to overcast?
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.480]   I don't know.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.000]   It's kind of a different thing, you know?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.960]   Like it requires so many different considerations and, and, you know, I don't know.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.880]   It's one of those things like it's always on my to-do list, but it's never high enough
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.400]   on the jewellus to actually get done.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.360]   So, you know, probably not, if I'm honest.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.160]   Be honest.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.040]   That's fine.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.000]   Marco of course is a podcaster himself.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.120]   He appears on much more, you know, popular shows like the accidental tech podcast.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.280]   His show, actually, along with Casey List and John Syracuse.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.080]   He is really, I think Marco really is,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.280]   there's a, I've always thought of this.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.400]   There's a gang of kind of Mac people.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.840]   And Andy, I always thought Andy was one.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.800]   Jason was one, you're one, John Gruber.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.280]   There's just these, these people who are in the inner circle.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.120]   And I always standing outside looking, say, have fun at Apple Park.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.000]   Just say hi to Steve Jobs Theater and watch as you guys go in.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.080]   But it's nice to have somebody like that on the show who really knows what he's talking about.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.680]   You're, you're, you're still code though, which is interesting.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.640]   You haven't given that up.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.920]   No, I honestly don't see an end in sight for that.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.760]   I mean, I love writing my own code and overcactus of one person company.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.240]   And so there is no one to take it over for me.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.360]   And I like having the one person company.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.640]   There's a lot of advantages to that.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.360]   And it's just, I work better that way in many ways.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.080]   And so I guess I kind of like doing it all myself.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.720]   And you know, I don't, I don't always have the time to do like a ton of coding.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.080]   But when I do, I, you know, I work very efficiently as far as I can.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.240]   And I think it's some stuff done sometimes.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.000]   It's cool. You still do a coding podcast under the radar with David Smith.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.720]   Is it swift? Is it all swift now that you're doing these days?
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.640]   Mostly overcast is still mostly objective C.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.600]   So whenever I'm working on existing code, I'm, I'm going to be just to see and stuff.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.680]   But I'm trying to do all the new stuff in Swift.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.040]   And that's, it's a massive project to try to like bring everything over.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.200]   But you know, that's, that's kind of my current like, you know, long term project that I'm working on.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.120]   And of course, was the lead developer at Tumblr back in the day.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.280]   Tumblr is actually having a little bit of a resurgence with Elon Musk letting Twitter
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.320]   die on the vine, so to speak.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.480]   I'm using Tumblr a lot.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.920]   We had Matt, I'm on my way gone a few months ago.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.360]   And he, he, he was really excited about the future for Tumblr.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.040]   It must be nice to see your baby still, still kicking.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.880]   It really is. And, and, you know, I couldn't be happier that Matt has it.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.840]   Because, you know, what he does, he does such good work on the web.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.320]   He's like, he's the perfect owner for it.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.680]   And, you know, he and I, I think are our, our principles align a lot on a lot of things.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.120]   And yeah, I like Matt a lot.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.560]   So I'm actually, I'm very optimistic.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   I, you know, when, when, when Tumblr was going through, you know, like the whole, you know,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.880]   Verizon, you know, kind of dull drums.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.280]   Horrible.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.400]   I was worried about it.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.920]   And I, you know, I kind of had thought, you know, well, I guess that's the end.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.440]   But, but no, now it has this wonderful resurgence.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.600]   And that's in part, thanks to, you know, Twitter, Exodus.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.680]   But also, I think in much larger part because, you know, automatic is doing a really good job
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.560]   with it so far.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.080]   Matt's really a proponent of open source too, which I, which I kind of like.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.080]   I mean, I think, uh, I know you don't work in open source or do you do open source stuff at all.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.440]   Here and there, not, not to the degree that he does, you know, I, I use, I use a bunch of open
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.480]   source. Obviously, like everybody does. Um, I, I have some open source projects that I have
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.320]   created, but nothing big.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.040]   You, uh, I looked at your Twitter and you haven't been there in a few months.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.480]   You have moved over to the Masto, which is good.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.120]   I like that.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.760]   We've got your Mastin on, uh, link on the page.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   They wouldn't, oh, actually they do let you do it on, uh, on Twitter.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.480]   That's interesting.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.920]   How do you get the lock logo in there?
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.480]   I like that.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.000]   Does that mean?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.760]   I said my account to private private.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.240]   Okay.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.800]   That's good.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.680]   I have to do that.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.560]   You are a legacy verified.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.160]   You may or may not be notable.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.560]   I don't know if you, I don't know if you've noticed that, but it goes back and forth.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.360]   So everyone's, you know, I check everyone's in a while just to see,
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.040]   well, am I notable or not?
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.360]   And, uh, at the moment I'm notable, but, but I've also had the legacy.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.080]   It's like they can't decide like they're going back and forth.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.000]   It's shocking that something about Twitter is fluctuating randomly.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.240]   I, I was really sad they, uh, laid off on Saturday of Twitter.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.600]   And this isn't the Twitter show, but I'll just mention this parenthetically,
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.880]   that they laid off a bunch of people, including I was sad as he lay a cover who, uh, uh,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.240]   Oh, I didn't know she didn't make it through.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.360]   She didn't make it through.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.040]   Well, she made it through until Saturday.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.000]   Right.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.560]   That's, I was, I was surprised she made it as far as she did.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.600]   But yeah, wow.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.840]   She was unlike, uh, some people, she didn't become an Elon stand to save her job.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.920]   She was circumspect.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.680]   I remember her posting on Twitter.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.200]   I got my stat, my print out.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.640]   It was like this thing.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.360]   And then the last thing she tweeted, which is kind of sad is that her space,
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.440]   she was doing spaces and somehow she pushed something on spaces as the broke
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.560]   other things on Twitter.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.320]   She says, thank goodness the team caught it and turned it off, but she was a little,
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.800]   uh, embarrassed.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.920]   I don't think that's why she got fired.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.160]   I think she got fired because she wasn't enough of a stand.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.080]   Um, yeah.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.360]   And we, you know, who, who we've all pushed crazy things.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.480]   I mean, yeah.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.920]   When I was like, yeah.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.720]   Like when I was a tumbler, I, you know, if I like, you know, made,
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.640]   I made the wrong keystroke somewhere.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.480]   We would serve like 11,000 error pages per second until I fixed it.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.120]   That was not good for the stress levels, honestly.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.440]   And that was, and that was way smaller than Twitter scaling.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.280]   I can't even imagine like doing what she was doing.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.920]   Oh my God.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.040]   I couldn't handle it.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.600]   They Marco Armit report to the conference room.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.480]   Marco Armit.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.400]   For who works in the conference room, please.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.080]   She, she said, well, by accident, like took down Twitter, you can blame email,
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.720]   Elon, if you like, I turned on a spaces feature that did not perform well at scale.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.560]   Luckily, the site's ability team was on it right away and we rolled it back.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.480]   Current mood fail.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.360]   Well, well, I'm, Leah will land well.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.200]   I'm sure she's, she's super talented.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.440]   Great coder.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.360]   She was a co-creator of OAuth.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.920]   So I think the open source community will welcome her with open arms.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.040]   All right.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.600]   Enough.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.040]   Pestering you, Marco, although I have many more questions,
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.160]   but we should probably talk about other things.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.480]   There is, there is Apple stuff to talk about.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:37.120]   Steve Jobs birthday was February 24th and I'm, you know, the Steve Jobs archive,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.200]   which has kind of laid, laying fallow since they launched it.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:47.600]   We was launched by his widow and some friends to, to host some things.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.120]   There were memos there and things.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.160]   They posted a picture.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:57.040]   And I think kind of a cute picture of, of Jobs in New Orleans in February,
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.480]   84, what happened in January, 84, the Mac came out and he was staring through the window.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.360]   I think this was like a, see, it says, I think a Best Buy or something like that.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   And at, at a woman who was sitting down at the demo Macintosh,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.400]   there it is the very first Mac playing with it.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.200]   He was watching avidly to see, I bet he was actually, this was his own user testing.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.440]   It's kind of a cool inside photo of Steve.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.880]   Those are the stories that don't get out.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.200]   More, the ones that have the greatest velocity are when he gets angry and does something,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.640]   does something traumatic.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:39.840]   But the, to me, like the canonical Steve Jobs is always like during a demo of, of anything,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.200]   watching him, like especially, especially when the smaller venues, like a town hall in Apple,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.440]   like watching him, like off to the side, like in the dark, there's no light on him,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.120]   but you can kind of, if not paying attention to the, to the video, you can watch him.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.280]   And he is watching very, very closely.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.120]   And you see him smiling as certain hits appear in the video.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.800]   That's, I hope that that's something that the Steve Jobs project kind of illustrates.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.920]   Take back President's Day, make February 24th, Steve Jobs Day.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.520]   You wouldn't, you get no pushback from me.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.400]   Here is, there's, there's slowly posting like old memos and stuff.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.680]   Here's a weird poem that he sent to himself in 2010, shortly before his death, about a year
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.720]   before his death.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.920]   He wrote a little, I speak a language I did not invent or refine.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.080]   I do not make any of my own clothing.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.240]   I did not discover the mathematics I use.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.760]   I grow a little of the food, I eat.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.480]   I'm protected by freedom and laws I did not conceive.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.640]   I'm moved by music I did not create.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.480]   When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.120]   I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object-oriented programming, or most of the
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.800]   technology I work with.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.480]   I love and admire my species, living and dead.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.200]   And I am totally dependent on them for my life and well-being.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   That's, uh, damn, that's pretty profound, huh?
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.640]   I do note that he forgot to change the default signature in Apple Mail on the iPad.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.320]   It says sent for my iPad, but other than that, you'd think that'd be the first thing
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.560]   Jobs would do, right?
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.160]   He probably wrote that.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.400]   He's probably his idea.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.760]   He's like, what have you been there?
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.920]   Oh, guarantee you is his idea, right?
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.200]   Guarantee you.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.760]   So they're slowly putting stuff up there.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:32.880]   This is, uh, Tim Cook, apparently Johnny Ive, uh, and, uh, Steve's widow or put this all together.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.160]   So I think that's really cool.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.040]   I think that's really cool.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.200]   And a beautiful, I think I like it that's such a personal photo
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.600]   of, uh, of Steve, um, looking at his creation, which if you remember that time,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.680]   he was already embattled, right?
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.120]   That Lisa had was a flop.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.400]   Uh, he'd hired, uh, the Pepsi guy to run the place.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.680]   And, uh, the Pepsi guy wasn't too happy about Macintosh shortly after, uh, uh,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.480]   fired Steve.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.120]   So he was already kind of, I think realized he was, he was one of the pirates.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.560]   Not, not one of the, uh, one of the owners.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.720]   The picture we should give credit to a Steve's friend, Gene Pagosi,
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.360]   who calls himself a serious amateur photographer.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.320]   Uh, Gene didn't work at tech, but Steve invited him along to a software conference in New Orleans,
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.720]   one evening after the event, as they were walking down O'Keefe Avenue looking for dinner.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.240]   Steve, a notoriously fast walker pulled to a halt.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.320]   Someone in the store window was working on a Mac and Tashi had to take a closer look.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.760]   How was this person using the Mac?
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.680]   Steve was so curious, so lasered in on trying to understand that he's
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.760]   bent nearly a double.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.560]   Anyway, that's the history this week.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.680]   Is there anything new this week?
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.280]   Mark, are you going to buy a 15 inch MacBook Air M2 when that comes out?
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.000]   If it comes out?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.720]   I think I'll be one of the only people in the world who doesn't buy it, but man,
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.240]   I like, I hope they release it just because so many people want that machine.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.400]   You know, the, the Macbook Air, it, it's such a good computer now.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.520]   I mean, it's always been pretty good.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:11.440]   But now it's like there, there's almost no downside for almost any workload to be done on a MacBook
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.680]   Air. It's, it is the default computer for everyone and it should be.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.400]   And the one big thing holding it back for a lot of people was, I want something a little bit bigger.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.080]   I want a little bit more screen space or whatever.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   And, and you know, until now, well, until this comes out, you know, you had to
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.720]   just jump to something that costs twice as much money.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.600]   And, you know, to have, to have another option here that, you know, takes just the same
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.240]   specs of the MacBook Air and just adds a bigger screen and changes basically nothing else
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.760]   and doesn't incur all the cost of all the higher end parts that are in the MacBook Pros.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.640]   That I think is going to be a blockbuster.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.720]   I think it's really true that from almost, I would say 99% of people using Macs,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:56.560]   you don't need a pro that the MacBook Air is kind of amazingly performant.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.600]   I have the M2 MacBook Air and I still want the 15 inch.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.400]   I won't buy it, but it's tempting.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.360]   Andy, are you tempted?
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.600]   You know what? I keep coming, I keep coming closer around to it.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   The only, I think that the only limiting thing for the MacBook Air for me is that I do,
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.000]   I can't afford to have lots and lots of different Macs.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.280]   And so whatever wherever laptop I guess probably going to do double duty on a desktop.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.200]   And I really like the idea of being able to have more than one external display.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.120]   But really, when you consider that that's the only limitation of a device that
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.800]   used to be the MacBook of eternal compromise.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.640]   You only get 64 gigs of storage.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.480]   You only get one USB port.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.160]   The battery is not that great.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.200]   All the keyboard is not going to be as good as what you get on a regular MacBook.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.280]   But people were screaming for it anyway.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.880]   Just the idea of having something that is not quite so thick and heavy and bulky
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.120]   that gets all the, that ticks all the boxes.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   I mean, I think Mark was absolutely right.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.840]   I mean, if it were important to reorganize by logic, the names of products in the in the
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.880]   Mac line, I think that the MacBook Air should become the MacBook to free up the term MacBook
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.960]   Air for something that has the original cache, something that, okay, it only has one USB
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:19.520]   C port. However, it is no thicker than an iPad Pro with the smart keyboard attached to it.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.640]   And it's not as powerful.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:26.480]   But if you want something for $1,000 that you basically won't even think about leaving at home,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.520]   there is your deal for you.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.680]   Alex, you were going to say something.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.000]   Okay.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.640]   Oh, I just, I'm really looking forward to something larger.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.920]   It could bring me back around.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.200]   I have to admit that I have a 14 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.920]   And I dislike the size so much I realized I've almost stopped using a laptop.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.160]   Really?
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.880]   Two, two, three.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.200]   You know, like I got it because it was going to be more portable.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.480]   I just find it so painful.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.120]   Like it's just, it just so, I just get angry all the time.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.080]   I love using it.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.560]   I'm using it.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.080]   If I hadn't caught the end of it, I'd still be using it.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.880]   I'm thinking now we saw the story this week that Apple has apparently bought up
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.080]   all of TSMC's three nanometer process.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:08.240]   No, it's every single chip, every one of them, which isn't as much as you might,
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.840]   that might, you know, apply.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   Oh my God, they're going to make a lot of M3 laptops or desktops.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:22.160]   But, but they only, right now, at least according to the rumor, are making 45,000 units in March.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.280]   So 45,000 times 12 is not a lot.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.640]   It's not as good as iPhones.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.320]   It's got to be about the iPhone, right?
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.640]   Like, yeah, it's not even all the iPhones.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.200]   I mean, it means you want the iPhone 15 will probably have two chips, right?
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.440]   An M2 and an M3 if they were a 15 and a 16 or whatever they call it.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.360]   Yeah, you're wasting time.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.560]   They've turned this pattern, you know, last year of having the, you know,
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.960]   quote, consumer level iPhone and then the pro and actually have different chips for the first time.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.360]   And so this gives them, I think part of the reason they might have done that
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.840]   was to prepare for this fall when the pro phone presumably has a three nanometer chip,
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.920]   but they probably don't have enough production capacity to make every iPhone of the year
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.240]   use that process node.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.600]   So that, my guess is that's what this is for, that, you know,
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.240]   where they're going to have three nanometer for the pro phones,
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.400]   they might even push the price a little bit higher to encourage, you know,
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.400]   not only reap a lot of profit because that usually works for them,
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.160]   but also then to encourage more people to pick the consumer one who were kind of on the fence.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.320]   Now that the sizes match up, there's, you know, there's not a lot of reason for many people
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.960]   to jump to the pro, although people keep doing anyway.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.240]   So, and look, I'm guilty of this as well.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.400]   I don't, I don't really need the pro, but I like the pro.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.280]   So I get the pro.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.480]   I would, I would, I mean, if the only thing keep me from buying a 15 inches,
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:47.520]   the idea of getting in a, an M3 with an OLED screen is pretty tempting that,
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.560]   but you're, sounds like you're saying, don't expect that anytime soon.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.560]   They're going to use them all up on the iPhone.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.920]   I mean, I'm sure there are going to be some max that have, you know,
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.480]   something called an M3 that has three nanometer process presumably, but I don't know when,
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:06.480]   you know, the M2s just came out. The M2, you know, the M2 Pro and Max just came out.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.080]   We still don't have an M2 Ultra.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.120]   And we don't even know if we're going to have an M2 Ultra.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.200]   And then the M3 timeline is still a mystery.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:18.880]   But I think we, if they follow the same time and they've been doing for, you know, for the M series so far,
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:24.240]   then we shouldn't expect the very first M3 products until at least this fall and possibly later.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.720]   And that would be, that wouldn't be the high end ones.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.320]   That would be, you know, the regular M3.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.120]   And, but that, it might not be this fall.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.240]   Maybe they have, maybe they need to save the capacity for iPhones at first.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.640]   Maybe we won't see M3 Max until the spring or next summer.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.120]   Who knows?
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:48.640]   You may remember the soap opera around all this TSMC increased the cost for the three nanometer process chips.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:56.240]   Apple balked, but apparently gave in because, according to the digit times, again, Apple doesn't announce it.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.000]   But according to the digit times, they have purchased the entire run of M3 chips.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.160]   The yields, I'd also heard that the yields were good on the, on the three nanometer mode node.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:15.040]   But if you compare 45,000 wafers a month in March to what they're doing right now with the
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:22.960]   previous node, the five nanometer mode, which is 1.3 million a month, that's a big difference.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.160]   Extreme tech, was it an artisan, small batch product?
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.480]   Well, at the moment, you know, I think that, I think the thing is, is that assuming that they
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.320]   would continue at the same pace for a year is probably, I'm like, the price yields are probably
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.720]   getting, you know, once they, once they kind of get the thing running.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.480]   And I think that it's important.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.400]   One of the things that Apple's doing really effectively right now is pulling away from everybody else.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.280]   And both in power consumption as well as power.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.480]   And so I think that they don't, I don't think they want to lose.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.800]   I think that the game of chicken that TMMC did.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.720]   They wanted decided to play.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.760]   They won Apple play.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.560]   And now they can make as many as they want with it.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.840]   And I'm sure that if they came back to Apple and did that, I'm sure that the cost of production
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.880]   was higher as well.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.200]   Like, I think that's probably where it was driven from is that it's probably a lot harder to make
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.440]   these because I mean, when you think about, I don't know, if we step back and look at what three
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.920]   nanometer, three nanometer actually means it's an insane.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   Well, it doesn't, ironically, actually mean three nanometers, among other things, but.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.320]   No, but I mean, just three nanometers like.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.040]   I'm just saying that it's like the chips of, you know, the, the, the.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.840]   Oh, it is amazing.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.040]   It's just absolutely amazing.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:29.840]   Truly amazing.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.760]   It's incredible what they're doing.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:38.080]   In fact, I'm of the impression and maybe I'm wrong, but I think others of the impression that
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:47.040]   the M2/A15 is kind of a, because it wasn't a big jump from the M1, right?
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:54.000]   Is kind of a interim on the way to what will be another big jump, which is the, the three nanometer
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   M3.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.160]   And it could be a tick-tock like they've done another thing.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:56.960]   Yeah, kind of like a tick-tock.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.200]   Like a tick-tock.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.280]   You know, you may see, you may see the M3, make a big, a bigger jump and then the M4 being
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.000]   a lighter jump and then the M, you know, like it could be.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.880]   And you're right, Mark.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.400]   I'm not talking this year.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.560]   Obviously, the iPhone will eat up all of this product.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.880]   Maybe, I mean, it may be that these are really put into the desk, into the computers before
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.840]   they're put into the phone.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.160]   He's saying.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.760]   Because because, well, because you can't get, if they don't have the supply in the fall,
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.800]   you know, if they don't have enough that they can reasonably put out, although they could put
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.200]   them out and say, well, you're going to wait for the next six months to get them.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.000]   Like that's the other option is they're only in the pros.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.160]   And if you don't order them the first day, you'll wait until January to see one,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.600]   which we've seen in the past.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.320]   So, so it's not impossible that they just are, they just put them out as fast as they can make them.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:47.200]   Yeah, if you can only make half a million chips a year, that is not even close enough.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.960]   There's a lot of us now that they've just gotten to the habit that there's going to be some,
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.720]   there's going to be some morning in September that at 5 a.m. we are
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:01.520]   hammering the website to make sure that we get something to reach the amount of time.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.360]   They say this is wafers.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.800]   I don't know, you know, the way Silicon chips are made, they make these larger things and then
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.280]   cut them up.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.120]   I don't know if that means it might not mean 45,000 microprocessors.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:19.840]   It might mean 45,000 of the big Silicon wafers, which can then be chopped up in the hundreds or
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.680]   thousands of individual chips.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.960]   So it really may be many more than half a million a year.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.840]   I'm not sure exactly what they're talking about, but when they say wafers, it sounds like that's
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.000]   the big thing.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.680]   That's a technical term, you know, the big, the big ground thing.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.800]   I have one of them at all.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.160]   John, where is it?
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.760]   Do you know where that big wafer is?
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.200]   We should get one.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.160]   This is an old.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.280]   This is probably a 45-nan-minute process.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.000]   In the in the in the tear downs, it'll be interesting to see how much more they keep on
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.920]   moving into the into the chip as well.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.080]   I mean, so every every iteration, if we've seen stuff that they've talked about in the past,
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.160]   every iteration is going to have less and less external processing, you know, where they're
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.680]   just going to keep on it sounds like, I mean, it sounds like there's some trajectory where
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.080]   four or five years from now, there's just a solid chip that gets inserted into the phone
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.160]   and we're like, okay, we're done, you know, with without much peripheral because they talk about
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.160]   legacy, legacy parts.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.560]   That's kind of a language you use when you're getting rid of them.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.880]   Just like with a lot of rumors this week about the timetable for Apple's cellular modem,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.120]   and it's it's been nice to have a separate chip for that, just like with use with with Qualcomm.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:35.280]   But you can imagine that their goals are to have one iPhone system on a chip that has everything
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.880]   on one die and they're moving that way, aren't they?
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.000]   So kind of impressive, really.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.320]   Now, TSMC's in Taiwan.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:49.520]   The other big story of the week is Apple and we've been talking about this for some times,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:55.920]   gradually trying to get out of China and and move to other places, probably not Taiwan.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.880]   I'm thinking more India, Brazil, Vietnam.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.440]   Did see one story this week that said,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.320]   Vietnam's going to be much more expensive to produce.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.640]   Here's a story from Bloomberg.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.960]   Apple suppliers are racing to exit China.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.600]   AirPods maker says, yeah, it's not just Apple.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.720]   It's it's all their suppliers.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.680]   I mean, this is it's a it is a serious, serious threat for Apple.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.000]   It's an existential threat for their suppliers.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.080]   You know, there's there are their their suppliers are this is a life and death situation.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.640]   If something goes wrong with if for the companies that are in China right now,
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.240]   if if there's an attack on on Taiwan, which is what everyone's worried about.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.680]   And I just I just feel like this is the most from from a government perspective,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.200]   it is the most insane thing.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.400]   I mean, Russia going into Ukraine was insane.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.640]   China talking about Taiwan four years from now is more insane,
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.600]   because what it does is it tells every supplier in China,
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.480]   get out of town.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.040]   And so they're like literally burning their own business, their own industry to the ground,
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.360]   because no one was here in 2027.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.480]   You know, like that's the I mean, like no one no one wants to be left here,
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.440]   because anybody, you know, if and whether they go in or not,
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.440]   the the broadcast of it is just it's absolute insanity.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.760]   You know, and so it's and so that all these suppliers are trying to,
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.280]   you know, diversify as fast as they can.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.600]   I mean, I don't think anyone wants to be there right now.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.120]   As an example from the Bloomberg story, AirPods maker goer tech.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.280]   Which today cranks out the bulk of the world's gadgets from iPhones to PlayStations,
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:37.920]   is investing an additional $280 million in a new Vietnam plant while considering an India expansion.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.720]   And of course, Apple's been doing the same thing TSMC is building a big plant in the US.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:48.640]   It won't be a three nanometer plant.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.160]   Yeah, it'll be a larger node, but still as I mean, those legacy nodes are just as important.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.480]   You could build a you could have a phone that has a beautiful A16 chip in it,
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.520]   but no, nothing else.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.800]   Really isn't a phone in that case.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.360]   Well, you look at the in the audio industry one one factory burned down in Japan,
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.600]   and they're still recovering.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.080]   I mean, there's some there's some devices that will never get made again,
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.400]   because that that you know, the AAD, AAD processor went down.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.720]   And that's you know, so it only takes one chip to bring bring a lot of the stuff back.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.120]   Two months ago, Gwoming G said Apple has abandoned its iPhone SE in 2024.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.000]   Now, Gwoming G says, yes, they're going to do a fourth generation iPhone SE,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.760]   the 6.1 inch OLED display and an Apple designed 5G chip.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.520]   That's that's I guess that's that modem chip you were talking about, Andy.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.400]   So they're getting so they are getting close to getting their own modem.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.680]   But obviously everything on one chip would be Apple's goal, right?
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.720]   Just make all one big.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:57.040]   Oh, but it's but it's going to take a couple years of actual like consumer dog fooding
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.400]   before they're going to put that modem chip into a flagship phone.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.040]   This is I believe this rumor because it makes a lot of sense that they would put it in a lesser
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.440]   phone, not not not because they don't think it's going to work, but because they know they're
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:15.200]   not going to see where the failure points are until they put until they have actual like a
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:21.840]   million users actually using it. Another story is that one of the problems that they're having
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:28.960]   Apple is not with the plain old simple 5G, but the millimeter wave component of it,
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.320]   the stuff that gives you the really, really super fast transfers.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.240]   And so to put it in a budget phone where hopefully people who are buying those phones
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   don't really care about it, I mean, millimeter wave is not a huge big deal depending on where
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.760]   you happen to live to take advantage of it. But yeah, I like that idea.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:49.120]   And I also think that the first really the first generation of iPhones that has any kind of a brand
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.160]   new modem chip, it's going to be a lot of hurt for a lot of people in those edge cases, not for
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:59.280]   90% of the people, but you just have to be part of that 5% or 10% to make this the worst phone you
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.960]   ever you ever had. And Apple does not want that phone to have an Apple logo on it.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.360]   Yeah, this is exactly what we're both saying the significant decline in Qualcomm's Apple orders
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.000]   in the foreseeable future is a foregone conclusion. No more Qualcomm.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.880]   Even the CEO of Qualcomm was saying that we expect Apple to have their modem sooner rather than later.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.400]   I don't think that was official investor guidance, but I think that that was sort of where he was
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.880]   going with that. Yeah, it's still being imagined Qualcomm's still making tons of money off the
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.480]   patents. Like, you know, even even if Apple makes them open, I bet a lot of the cost of that is
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.720]   still going to Qualcomm in the end of the day. Yeah, this is this is their transition, right?
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:42.160]   From a hardware maker to to a patent IP company. It's still being determined, quote tweets, whether
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:48.640]   the iPhone 16 series will use Apple's 5G baseband chip. The main challenge lies in whether Apple can
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.280]   overcome the technical obstacles related to millimeter wave and satellite communications.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:58.960]   So I guess that's the Qualcomm chips have that. Nevertheless, once the SE4 starts using Apple's
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.840]   5G baseband chip, it's a foregone conclusion. Qualcomm's orders will decline, assuming mass
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:11.280]   production goes smoothly in the first half of next year. So that's important. First half of
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:17.200]   next year, the iPad and Apple watch will soon abandon Qualcomm's baseband chips too.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.480]   You know, cool, writes these in analysts. So he writes these for investors.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.880]   So this is this is more investment advice than anything else.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.440]   And I have to say that I mean, I'm sure there's so many, a lot of money from the patent,
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.960]   but whatever they thought they were going to get out of a lawsuit, I'm not sure if it
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.240]   turned out. You know, like, I don't think that they, you know, like in the end, you know,
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.680]   you get into a big fight like this. And the same thing with Epic. I mean, they,
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.920]   whatever they thought they were going to make more of, you know, make more going down that path,
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.760]   like picking a fight with a very, very large, you just got to really think through that
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:56.240]   from a five or 10 year curve, not from the initial impetus. And I think that I don't think
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.680]   the Qualcomm played that, that deck very well.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:07.280]   All right. Let us take a little break. We've got Marco Arment with his effect.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:13.120]   I'm going to make this offer to our discord users. We've got a stage open. If there's,
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   if any of you want to ask questions of Marco, Marco, is anything off limits?
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:24.640]   Can they ask about your celebrity wife? Yeah, whatever. Okay. All right. Nothing is off limits.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.560]   Raise your hand in the stage. If you have a question, we'll see if we get enough questions.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:35.040]   So we can, we can pepper Marco Arment. It's really great to have him and his coffee bean bags
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.520]   on the show with us today. This is a, does it?
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:45.280]   Don't forget my fish mug. Okay. Oh, look at that. You know, we, we went to see Umphreeze,
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.960]   McGee speaking of jam bands. It's on a fish coaster, of course, you know,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.520]   look at that. Did you make that yourself? Somebody on it. Yeah.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.760]   No, somebody else you made. That's really cute. How do you know that's a fish coaster? Is that
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.240]   their logo or something? Yeah, it's, it's a whole thing. It's, you know, the drummer wears a
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.880]   moo moo that has this pattern on it for every show. It's a whole thing. It's not worth it.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:14.000]   Sean, you found your equal. John is a, um, freeze, McGee stand and you found your equal fish stand here.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.520]   Totally. Do you like other jam bands or is it all fish all the time?
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:24.160]   I like other jam bands too, but they're, they're my number one by, by a pretty wide margin.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.200]   I don't know if fish does this. I wouldn't be surprised if they did. We went to see
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:33.360]   Umfries McGee on Thursday of last week. And this is so cool for 30 bucks extra.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:39.680]   They will provide you with a little Sennheiser, uh, headphones, a wireless
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.480]   headphone amp or you can bring your own headphones or they offer headphones. I brought my own,
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.720]   in ear monitors, you plug in and now you're hearing the soundboard instead of the crappy.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.160]   I don't care how good a band is and how good their sound is. It's never as good as if you're
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.720]   listening on the board, right? This was the best thing about that. Then you can control the volume.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.520]   Like, you know, if I actually go to a concert, I wear concert earplugs and then you're cutting
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.240]   out a lot of high frequency. It doesn't quite sound as good. Yeah. Right. Where if you, if you
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.840]   have like, you know, super isolating, like I am's and then you have something like that,
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.080]   you can control the volume, but still be experiencing it live. Yeah. That's a really cool thing.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.320]   It pretty much feels separated. You didn't feel separated. No, because you're still feeling
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.560]   the bump and you're still feeling the elbows. You're still in the crowd and actually it was
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:32.160]   interesting because my wife is with me and she's saying, "Is the band swearing at us?"
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.680]   And she finally realized, "No, no, the mics are picking up the audience out in the
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:42.240]   crowds." You hear the audience through the mics. No, you're very much there, but just
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:48.480]   you say, Mark, you're not deafening yourself. This is what we use as well. This is the Sennheiser
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:55.600]   300. I am. And so the end, and you, oh, you, you rent it. You rent it. They have it there. They
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.560]   have a table. You go up there, give me a 30 bucks. Did you buy it? Do you buy it with a ticket?
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.560]   And you're wired, you're wired to that and it's wireless to pick it up. Yeah.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.280]   So you turn this up and if you want it louder, if you want to defend yourself, you can.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.160]   But it was funny. I took out the monitors just to hear it. You know, concert hall sound,
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.760]   especially, you know, this is at the Mystic Theatre in Peteloma, not notorious for its sound.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.920]   And it's, you put this in and it's, oh, it's suddenly you hear, it's clear, it's incredible.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.880]   Does fish do that, Marco? No, I, I, not that I know. I mean, I went to a couple shows last
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.800]   summer that I've never seen that. That's a really cool idea. Yeah, we should. I would jump on that
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.920]   in a heartbeat. And do they just take your, do they take your license or something to make sure
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.480]   you bring it back or how do you like, how do you get it? They're expensive, aren't they? They charge
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:49.120]   a deposit. One dollar. Oh, but then they have your credit card. Yeah. So, yeah. So we should
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:54.640]   probably give this back. I didn't mean to take it home. I just, no, this is ours. We use these,
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.920]   it's funny because this is what we use for our interior monitors during the show for our talkback.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:07.760]   So I'm not wearing it right now, but yeah, it really sounded good. I have to say,
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.680]   we've talked about that. I work on concerts. You should do it totally. We've talked about the idea
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:19.920]   of giving everybody, everybody in ear for, if you're recording the band, what I'm really
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.760]   interested in is recording the band. And I specifically want to put it into a five dot one. So my whole
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.000]   thing is, is the crowd kind of screws that all up by making all that noise that goes into my,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.080]   you know, it's the speakers that I want to hear the crowd. I want to hear the crowd. I just want to
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.960]   record them separately. So, so, so to put them in the things. And so I don't want, I don't want to,
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:43.520]   I don't want to corrupt it with the speakers. But, and so the idea of having a, because to me,
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.960]   the idea would be to turn, take, get rid of the speakers altogether and just give everybody in
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.920]   ear. I mean, really interesting. They call it headphones and snow cones, which is one of their
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:00.480]   songs. And $30 one dollar credit card hold includes belt pack, headphone rental and one hell of a
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:06.880]   good time. They say, Mark, Mark, do you, do you, what do you, fish is really known for live streaming?
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.480]   Do you watch any of those streams? Sometimes, yeah, like for the big ones, like New Year's,
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.640]   if I'm not doing anything that year, I'll do it. But I, I purchase all the sound work recordings
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.800]   from their site, like it has this live fish site. You get all the show. And it's, it's so nice being
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.680]   a fish fan, because like you, they make every show available for download for like 11 bucks.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.320]   And it's really high quality. It's, you know, it's sad. They professionally master every single one
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.560]   bunch, like what you're talking about. And so it's, it's really great. It's a, it's a wonderful
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.560]   thing. Because you get so much new music from them. And it's all really well, very, it's very
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:42.400]   accessible. I honestly think that that is an incredible model for modern bands. And I'm free
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.840]   does the same thing. In fact, sometimes at a concert, you can get as you go out the door, right,
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:51.280]   you can get the recording. If you wait a little bit, not anymore. Oh, used to be that give you a USB
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.160]   it now it takes four hours. And then they make it available for download, but they do that.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.920]   And they stream a lot of stuff. I know John's always running home to watch a stream.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:06.800]   All the time, streaming tonight. But this way they, you know, they don't, do they even have a label?
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:12.080]   I don't think they do. They don't do they? Okay. You don't really, you don't, oh, they own their
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:17.840]   own label. That's why you don't really need, you know, universal music group in your back pocket.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:24.240]   Any more. In fact, I would bet bands like this and fish do better without, you know, live
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:29.840]   your nation involved. If you're, if you're a business oriented and you understand what you
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.400]   have to know, you understand how to build community fishes, you know, fish and any Debranco and
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.600]   some of the other folks that have been able to build these, these audiences and build these
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.360]   communities, you know, there's a lot of artists that aren't that, that aren't that person, you
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.040]   know, that aren't that group that understands how to interact with their audience at a level. So
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.560]   that they need labels, because the labels are going to set that up and they're going to push it out
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.080]   and they're going to do all the things from things to be an artist and make music. But some of them
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.960]   understand the business model of it or find the business model over time. And for them,
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.400]   they don't need labels. I mean, I don't think I think that they could work outside of that pretty
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:06.480]   quickly. But you know, even things that we think are tick tock like we're discovered on tick tock
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:12.000]   might not have been. Yeah. There might have been some label label interacted in there.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.160]   I missed their Cancun concert on Saturday night. That would have been
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.280]   Yeah, it just ended. I would have. Oh man, I would have loved to do that. That sounds like fun.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.000]   Do you listen to a fish when you code? Is that good coding music?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.600]   Oh, it's great. Yeah, because it's, you know, it's a lot of instrumental.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   Right. And it's, you know, it's, it doesn't like jump out at me if I'm really focused the way,
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.360]   like a transition between artists would, like, you know, if you listen to your whole collection on
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.600]   shuffle, you're hearing God knows what. And you'll oftentimes, oh wait, I don't want to hear this
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.520]   now, skip, skip, skip. And that takes you out of the zone that you're coding in, right? So,
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.760]   and fish is also, you know, if I, if I put on, I've always been like an album person, you know,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.000]   I start an album, play straight through. And if, you know, with most bands, you start an album,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.680]   you play straight through, then you have to make another decision within 30 to 40 minutes.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:01.840]   Whereas with fish, their shows are like three hours long. So, you just start a show and just go.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.560]   And you don't have, then you can focus on whatever you want to focus on and not have to think about
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.960]   changing the music every so often. If you could go to a theater and watch fish, would you do it?
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.480]   Like a movie theater? Yeah. Mine.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.520]   Um, maybe, I don't know, probably not. Okay.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.440]   Uh, and part of what I like about seeing them is they play a lot of outdoor venues.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.560]   I greatly prefer outdoor venues to indoor ones. I almost never want to go to an indoor one.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:34.400]   And it was really smoky for Emfries. It was just, yeah. And I just, I was coughing most of the time.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:39.040]   Yeah, I find that very unpleasant. So that's why, like, I just, I like the experience of the
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.440]   outdoor venue. You know, you go in the summer, it's like, starts to get cooler at night. You know,
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.160]   you see all the smoke billowing up from the crowd and none of it's tobacco, but you see all of it
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.760]   building up from the crowd. But you don't have to smell it constantly. You're not like choking on
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.720]   it. Um, unless it's your own, in which case, you know, that that's up to you. Um, but it's, uh, it's,
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:02.000]   it's a, I love the outdoor experience. And frankly, I think it sounds better in most cases too.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.680]   If you are listening to the sound, because it's, you know, you have less of the, you know, the
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.200]   echoing and reverberation problems and, you know, the bass doesn't just take it over like you were
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:14.560]   saying. So yeah, I'm an outdoor concert. And do you've gone to opera shows in movie theaters though,
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:20.480]   right? Yeah. Uh, and just to be clear, we're not talking about a live performance in a movie
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.720]   theater. We're talking about a movie screen of the live performance. Yeah, they, they, some of the
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:31.520]   bigger, the bigger productions they will do like a live simulcast, like on a Saturday afternoon.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.960]   As a matter of fact, there's, uh, there's a new production of Longrin from Wagner that I had no
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:42.880]   interest in until I kept looking at the social media from like the, the, the chorus and the leads.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:49.200]   And like this looks proficiently weird and wonderful. And I can't, and I can't like make the, I can't
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.280]   make the jump. And I'm really like, I'm already like, this will be my first time back in a movie
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:58.800]   theater, like since COVID, no joke, because I don't want to miss this. Yeah. Cool.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.960]   So I, and I take it, Alex, that you're talking to people who are thinking about doing that kind of
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:13.520]   thing. I may work on that from time to time. So it's a, it's a, it's a pointed question.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.120]   Let me know when the Beatles are planning that because I would love, I will go to my local
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.280]   theater seat of Beatles. Absolutely. I wouldn't miss that for the world.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:28.240]   Our show today brought to you by our fine sponsor and my personal male provider, FastMail.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:37.280]   Uh, there's just no question that if you care about email, you should be paying for it. If you
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.160]   use email for your business, if you, even if you just use it to send your newsletter out,
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:50.080]   your email, free email is worth every penny you pay for it. But most of us today still use
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.360]   Gmail and Outlook and all the free. And I think that's nuts. And because I, especially because I
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.920]   hear from all the people, we had a caller on Saturday or Sunday and I asked the tech guys
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:05.520]   who had gotten his Google account canceled because he uploaded old family videos,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:11.520]   cut him off with no recourse. And that's the, that's one problem. Number one, with free email
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:17.040]   is you are not a customer. You are the product. That's problem number two.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:22.080]   They're, you're giving up your privacy. They're using your email for all sorts of things for
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.720]   advertising, for figuring out what you're interested in, free email and it's just not free.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:32.640]   For over 20 years, FastMail has been a leader in email privacy and I've been using FastMail
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:38.080]   for more than a decade. I moved off of Gmail. I was an early Gmail user and I, and I liked it.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.440]   What I really liked was webmail, but I didn't give up anything because FastMail's webmail
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:48.000]   is better than Gmail. It's fantastic, but you can also, it's also a very good eye map. They use
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.560]   an open source server, which they contribute back to called Cyrus. So it's, it's the best eye map out
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.600]   there. In fact, I really like FastMail because they are a big contributor to the email ecosystem,
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.680]   with internet standards, open source innovations that other email services,
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:11.120]   you know, try to use because it's the best. FastMail prioritizes your privacy. Your personal data is
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:17.600]   safe, kept away from third parties with better spam filters, absolutely no ads. All FastMail
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:26.080]   data is stored in the US. FastMail is fully GDPR compliant. And no, don't worry, it's not going
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:31.920]   to cost an arm and leg as well as $3 a month. I have been using FastMail for more than a decade.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:39.120]   I am a huge fan. I use it because, well, for all those reasons, but also because it's very
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:45.920]   customizable. It's power email for power users. Sure, just as easy to use as Gmail, but if you decide
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:53.440]   you want to dig deep, you can do it with DKIM and all of the authentication protocols, what is SPF
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:45:01.680]   DMARC so that your mail goes through better. In fact, I use my own domains for my email and I
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:08.720]   have those domains. The DNS comes from FastMail, which automatically gives me DMARC and SPF
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:15.040]   and DKIM automatically. So my email gets it through everywhere. Plus, I can have as many email
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:21.920]   addresses as I want. So I use say, Laporte.email. I can have when I sign up for an account with
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.800]   Instagram, it could be insta@laporte.email. Every single account I sign up for is unique.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.760]   Actually, FastMail also supports something I really like, which our other sponsor, Bitwarden,
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:36.240]   does, which allows you to generate unique email addresses for everything you sign up for,
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.600]   which adds to your security. It works with Bitwarden in one password.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:45.360]   You can have not only unique passwords for every account, but unique emails for every account.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.480]   And the email still gets through to you. You can organize your inbox with scheduled send.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:56.960]   You've got snooze. You've got folders and labels. You have a search bar that's very powerful and
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:04.080]   very fast. I actually, at this point, I've ported it. I know I use Google for my calendar or my address
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:14.240]   book or my notes. It all goes through FastMail. It's my contacts. It's my calendar.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:20.080]   I think FastMail does everything right. They also have the best spam filtering and they supports
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:26.400]   the CIV language. So I have a very sophisticated CIV. So my email gets organized before I even see
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:31.120]   it on the FastMail servers. So I don't miss important mail and I don't have to look at
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:37.520]   unimportant mail. And I definitely don't have to see spam. FastMail's U.S.-based support team
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.880]   aren't just notebook readers. They're full-time email experts. Every time I've talked to them,
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:49.440]   I've gotten great information. They put you first because you are the customer, not the product.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.760]   FastMail believes in working for customers as people to be cared for, not products to be exploited.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:02.480]   Advertisers, no. Bye-bye. Putting you in your privacy at the center. FastMail's fast,
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.600]   effective. They're a leader in email. They're the, I would say, the leader in email.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:17.200]   And frankly, they are the barrier. The wall-diving Gmail just take over the world. So I like supporting
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.640]   them. FastMail rocks. This is what one user says. It's secure, private, independent, has a Gmail
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.680]   transfer tool. You won't regret this move. Oh, that's right. It's very easy to move to FastMail.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:32.160]   You can even have FastMail. I do this with one inbox go out and get mail from a variety of providers.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.760]   So you're never going to miss anything. It's easy to download your old data imported into your
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.240]   new FastMail inbox. And just as easy to move out if you ever decide to. But you won't, like I said,
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.120]   10 years with FastMail. In fact, I buy three years at a time because I save a little money. Do I do
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:52.400]   in that? Because I know I'm going to be a FastMail customer for the rest of my life. FastMail.

[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:40.240]   our special ringer guest this week. Marco Arment. We're expecting you to hit home runs every time you
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:45.680]   step up to the plate, Marco. All these sports metaphors suggest that you have never actually seen
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:51.600]   me try to play a sport. You could be a ringer without actually putting a glove on, I got to say.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.960]   That kid looks awfully old to be a middle school if he asks me.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:02.880]   Chrome has been tweaked. It's kind of a statement that Google has to say,
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:11.200]   "Oh, we've tweaked Chrome, so it's better. It's not going to kill your MacBook anymore."
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:20.240]   That just shows you what a bad reputation is. As much. What are the stats? Do most Apple users use
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.160]   Safari or is Chrome as dominant there as it is everywhere else? It's something like 80 or 90%
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:30.240]   of the browser usage everywhere else, right? You see those stats, Marco, right?
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:37.680]   If I collected them, I might. I don't pay that much attention to Web browser stuff anymore.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:45.440]   I'm a Safari user. I'm very happy with it. That's it. I would guess that Chrome probably is the most
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:51.520]   popular browser on Mac OS. Even with the tyranny of the default, because you have to doubt.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:58.480]   Recently, I'm embarrassed to say downloaded Bing on my MacBook because I got into the Bing chat
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.920]   thing and I thought, "Well, I got to play with it." They said, "Well, you really need to use Edge."
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:08.400]   Oh, God, really? But now, I guess Edge will benefit too because this is really an improvement
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:13.440]   in Chromium, the open source back end to Chrome. The Chromium folks announced this.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:21.040]   They say Chrome users can now browse the internet for 17 hours on an M2 MacBook Pro
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.240]   or watch YouTube for 18 hours on a single charge.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:32.880]   If you've been to it, what was it before? I mean, that's a lot. I certainly think that's enough.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:37.440]   Should be enough. I think I saw somebody who's like a 30-minute gain or something, which I'll say
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:43.680]   that's a gain. This is kind of like saying when Microsoft makes something about Windows better.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.520]   Right. And it's like, "Well, okay, congrats. Good job. You made it better.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:56.800]   Better than it was, but... Is it good enough? There's still... Chrome is never going to prioritize
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:03.280]   power efficiency as much as Apple does. It's not a priority for them the way it is for Apple.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   And so they're always going to treat this as kind of, "Okay, we're going to keep advancing
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.440]   our other initiatives, our other needs, our other priorities, and if we can get some power
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:16.480]   savings along the way, great." Whereas Apple has a very different focus. Apple is so
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:23.040]   ruthlessly focused on power efficiency. And if there's some "webstandard," which people
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:27.440]   throw around a lot when they don't necessarily have the cashier to do so, but if there's some
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.680]   proposed standard that is going to destroy power efficiency, Apple just won't do it.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:37.840]   Or they will wait until they can do it in kind of a... We'll give you 80% of that and take 20%
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   of the power kind of way. Whereas Chrome's going to plow ahead and do whatever they want to do
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:47.680]   for their purposes. But power efficiency is never their top priority. So it's nice they're making
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:53.040]   gains here, but I wouldn't expect this to be a massive change overall.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.400]   Yeah. Plus Google has to support so many operating systems to which they don't have
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:03.840]   like metal access. And Apple can do so much when they say, "We're going to build this. We're going
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:08.960]   to put a Safari processor on every piece of Apple Silicon just to make sure that it will just
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:14.400]   sip, sip, sip power and beat every benchmark you're going to throw at it." If that's important to
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:21.120]   most, the question is going to be, is that going to be a user facing feature? If it's a small battery
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:27.280]   advantage, a lot of people are going to be like, "But this website works better for me on Chrome."
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:34.000]   Or, "I like the way that the Chrome's sync bookmarks for me across multiple devices and multiple
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.320]   platforms." So it's catch-22. I'm glad that people have the choice though.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:48.080]   I wonder, the one thing though that I would use Chrome for on any platform, I don't use Chrome,
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:55.120]   but if I were, it would be progressive web apps, which Apple has... Are you up on that at all,
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:00.240]   Overcast isn't a progressive web app. It's a real app.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:08.400]   I, as far as my web app is terrible, I'm not a good web front-end developer. I wasn't 10 years
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:14.240]   ago and I have not progressed my knowledge since. The whole world of all these
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:19.680]   JavaScript frameworks and having everything... I've never touched any of that. I have no idea
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:23.760]   how to do it. I frankly don't care because I'm focused entirely on the native app for the iPhone.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:29.200]   These worlds are so big now. I used to be able to do both. But now, these worlds are so big,
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:34.240]   you kind of have to specialize. It's really hard to do good apps and good web apps.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:41.360]   And so I've specialized. And so my web credentials are shot. Like, whatever I did at Tumblr is long,
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:46.800]   that's like ancient history. Today, I couldn't even be employed as a basic level one web developer
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.040]   anywhere. Does the company have a framework? Was there a framework you guys used or was it all
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:58.960]   just kind of JavaScript and HTML? There was a backend framework, like for PHP, but for the front-end...
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:06.720]   This was... Oh, yeah, of course. But this PHP is awesome. But on the front-end,
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:13.840]   I was there from 2006 to 2010. This was so far before what we now think of as a JavaScript
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.960]   framework. There were a few utilities. I think jQuery came out towards the end of that, but
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.880]   it was the early days. jQuery was a huge breakthrough at the time because it allowed you to not redraw
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:29.200]   the whole page, but just a little part of the page. And that's what a lot of these frameworks,
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.440]   like Angular and React, that's what they're doing is a lot of that. So that really was a
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.600]   seed change. But I agree with you. I mean, if you were to try to keep up with web technologies,
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.640]   it would be a full-time job these days because every three months there's something new.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.240]   -Brancy, I don't know how anybody gets any work done. -I know.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:49.200]   -I have an a hard enough time keeping up with one mobile app platform. I don't even do Android.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:54.640]   I just do iOS. Even that, keeping up with that is a full-time job that I can barely keep up
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.280]   with myself. I don't know how anybody does the web stuff.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:01.040]   -Have you played it all with the chat GPT related to code?
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.200]   -No. It's one of those things, again, it's on the to-do list, but it's not high.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.200]   -I don't even ask if they don't use co-pilot to write overcast. Come on, man.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:14.000]   -No, I talked to a lot of programmers, and it's not that they use the code like,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.640]   -Gizmo's not a start. -You know, line for line, but they go,
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.880]   write this, they'll ask it to write something and they look at it and they go,
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.680]   "Oh, yeah, this might be a good idea." They don't necessarily cut and paste it into the app,
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:29.280]   but I was just curious, because a lot of them have said that it just really speeds up their
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.040]   development. They can hunt around looking for things or they can snatch ass chat.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.760]   -Those are guys working. -It doesn't work as well with Swift.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.120]   -Those are guys working in a big team, and they are told, "Okay, you now have to write the log
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.640]   in code." -Yeah.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.680]   -So many coders, this is, I mean, you go to stack overflow and say, "Log in code,"
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.400]   and you copy and paste it. So it's just really more of the same, I think.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.040]   -Marco seems like-- -Yes, I automated copy and paste it.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:59.680]   -Yes, it's just automated copy. Marco, you're more of a hand-rolled kind of a guy, I think.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:05.600]   -Yes, well, because what most programming work in the world is fairly tedious. Take this data
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:11.040]   from here and show it in this form here, and we call it the crud, the acronym.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:17.920]   You're shuffling data around in fairly common, repeatable ways that are fairly
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:21.040]   interesting and don't require a lot of cleverness in what you're doing.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.320]   And so for that kind of thing, which is, again, most coding work in the world,
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.680]   it's probably good for that. But yeah, I don't really work that way for the most part.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.200]   Obviously, I do have to write some tedious code in my app, but for the most part, I'm doing like,
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:38.000]   I write very little code, and I think about it really hard.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.960]   And so most of the time that I am spending coding is not the typing.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:47.680]   I don't know anybody who makes the apps that I do who spends a lot of time typing.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:54.560]   So what it's saving me is not substantial, whereas where most of my time goes is
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:58.080]   thinking about what to write and then finding the bugs and what I wrote.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.360]   And you still have to do that part with chat GPT-generated code.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:06.640]   And it can give you a head starter, it can give you maybe ideas of, oh, I didn't think to do it that way,
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:11.600]   like you were just saying. But ultimately, it's not going to save me a ton of time the way I work.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:16.800]   Well, and we had just in a discussion about this yesterday related to code of,
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:22.160]   I consider pretty much React Native and all those things. We tend to call it monkey code.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.160]   Like it's just like a Ruby on Rails, all those things are just kind of like,
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:31.360]   they're an abstract that causes so much instability in our apps that when you're,
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.320]   you know, it doesn't really work anywhere. It just kind of barely survives it. And so
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.880]   usually I, if I'm designing an app, I usually end up, we build it and swift, we build it and,
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.320]   you know, like, and then we hand it off to someone that looks at the cross platform and
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:47.360]   someone says, let's do React Native. And that's when I punch out of the project.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:54.800]   You guys take that and have fun. But one of the things we were talking about is that
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:02.000]   with chat GPT at some point, not now, but in some point you could say, here's my swift code and I
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:09.840]   want, I want native Android code to push it out and just, you know, or here's what I'm trying to do.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:16.480]   And it could make eventually some of these kind of these structures obsolete because you could just
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:22.960]   build native code for both sides without having to abstract it to something that isn't as stable.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:28.320]   I mean, that's that might pan out that way. I hope it does, frankly, because that I think that
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:32.960]   could be really, you know, very productive for society. But we've seen over the course of computing
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:39.280]   history so many things that promised right once or anywhere. And that seems like another version
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.040]   of that. It is granted a much smarter and it's a very different way of doing that. And so maybe
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:48.480]   there's some promise there. But ultimately what we find over and over again when we attempt this
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:53.840]   kind of thing in technology is that there is way more specialization that each platform requires
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:59.040]   and special consideration and design decisions and feature decisions. And it's very hard to ever
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:04.560]   actually achieve that in practice. Yep. I kind of think of what you do more as
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:11.200]   almost like woodworking or when I code is like building little machines.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:17.920]   And but that's because I'm doing it in LISP so it's functional. So I think of it as like I'm
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:25.040]   building a little box little machine and it's kind of it does almost map to a physical building of
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:30.640]   things, which I think is more satisfying. Yeah, I mean, in many ways, it's a luxury, you know,
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:36.640]   like we are. It is. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, I'm very lucky that like my business does not
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:40.880]   require me to be cranking out huge volumes of code all the time. Most people don't have that
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:44.640]   choice. Most people have the boss telling them, look, you have like the next three days to get
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.480]   this thing done. And then it doesn't matter if it's not perfectly polished. We got to ship it then,
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:53.040]   you got to move on to something else. So, you know, it's very much a luxury to be able to say,
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:58.560]   you know, I'm going to take the last two weeks and tweak my database engine layer to be to have
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:03.040]   nicer code at the call site. And, you know, and that no one can tell me no, that I'm not allowed
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.640]   to do that. And that's that's a luxury most people don't have. And I'm very thankful for it.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.280]   You don't have that. I try to remain like sympathetic to the world of regular programmers who are
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.840]   who have a boss telling them, no, you can't take 16 hours to do that one little thing.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.760]   You don't have standups with yourself and have little scrums and none of that.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:26.480]   We got a can band board and it's all Marco. Marco does it all. He's everything.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:35.360]   Have you had to refactor 100% or are you still using, you know, decisions that you made in the
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:41.200]   earliest days of overcast today? Oh, I'm still stuck with lots of old stuff that I wish I could
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:45.440]   refactor easily. But, you know, it's I have a legacy, you know, on the server side, I have tons
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.320]   of legacy server side stuff where, you know, just ways I set up the data layer, you know,
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.280]   the structure of the database, you know, what how certain things map, you know, like URLs are one
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.480]   to one map to podcast. And that was a whole thing when everyone sort of moving their feet
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.800]   all over the place. You know, so they were, you know, there's decisions there. And then in the app
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.000]   and in the iPhone app, there's tons of old code that's still there and old interfaces are still
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.640]   there that, you know, I'm trying to work through and modernize and move over to Swift and Swift UI
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:19.040]   and async stuff, all the all the modern APIs and stuff. And and I'm it's a very slow process
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:23.280]   because they're just so much legacy. And there's stuff like feature and behavioral decisions where,
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.480]   you know, people when you have an established customer base, it's really hard to change anything
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.480]   without angering a whole bunch of people. And there are things I would do differently. If I
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.840]   was starting over with no existing customers to have to carry forward and to worry about, you know,
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.360]   what they think about it and what they've, you know, what they've supported with me over the years,
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.560]   you know, if I didn't have to think about that, and I was starting fresh, I would do
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.920]   things a little bit differently in certain areas, certain features I wouldn't do at all,
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.720]   certain features I would do differently, certain structures around like, you know, streaming,
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.200]   auto deleting, you know, feed management, you know, I would do some of those things differently.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.360]   But the reality is it's it's a it's an app that's almost a decade old. And so I have, I have a lot
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.120]   of customers to bring along with me. And so I had to do things a little more carefully and
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.720]   cautiously and have more things be settings that you can turn off.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.640]   They always say when you're designing code thinks think long and hard about your data
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.040]   structures, because you're going to live with them forever. And a lot of the code you write is
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:25.200]   just determined by what you decided at the very beginning on your data. What do you do? Is podcasting
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:32.080]   a moving target? There are people, I always get people saying you should be doing podcasting 2.0
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:38.000]   to which I just go. But yeah, I have. How do you respond?
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.640]   So similar to what I said earlier about web standards being kind of a squishy,
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:49.840]   a squishy concept, I don't like anybody declaring a new standard in some kind of large
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.400]   public way and saying this is the way we're now going to do things. And because what that does is
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.920]   it, it presumes that they are correct. It presumes that they have the authority to create such
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.040]   standards and it presumes that the market wants their standards and that their
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.440]   standards are implementable and easy to do. And those are all, I think, unsafe presumptions.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.600]   And so when something comes along, like the podcasting 2.0 thing, I have nothing against those people.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:20.800]   But what has happened is that I now regularly have people, you know, either in the worst case,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.680]   leaving bad reviews saying I don't support podcast 2.0 features and therefore I'm being
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:31.600]   a negligent developer or people write in saying when will you support feature XYZ and which
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.440]   presumes that I'm that I have to support feature XYZ or that I want to support feature XYZ.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.440]   And I don't, you know, I don't like other people dictating my roadmap for me or speaking for me
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.480]   or making these kinds of decisions for me. What I want to do in my app is I want to listen to my
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.720]   customers what they say and what they need and what I think is right for them and do that. And
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.560]   I have my own roadmap for that. And the podcast with 2.0 features, I think there's some good ideas
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:04.400]   there. But a lot of it got wrapped up in crypto stuff and I want I try to stay far away from that.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:09.120]   So there's there's the whole presumption that I need to do crypto stuff. And if I don't do that,
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.960]   then I'm somehow, you know, failing as a developer here. And so I try to stay away from that. But
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.720]   also a lot of the, a lot of the things they want to do are are features that already exist in other
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:27.760]   forms or features that I cannot really imagine the market adopting in large numbers. And so it makes
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.680]   it hard for me to justify the time. Meanwhile, there's features that my customers have been asking
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.880]   for for years that I'm trying to get to. And those aren't part of these standards,
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.640]   because these standards are usually not made by app developers. So they don't, they don't have the
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.280]   same feedback loop I have where I have my customers telling me, here's what we actually want. And so
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.200]   I know what I'm supposed to be building. I know how to spend my time. I have my own roadmap. And I
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.840]   know exactly what my customers have been wanting for years. And anybody can come along and write a
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.880]   standard and say, all right, here's your new thing, you have to do this. But I, I, in every case,
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:05.040]   I'll push back and say, do I? I hear I'm thank you because I hear from people fairly frequently
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.800]   saying, why don't you do chapters, which is one of the features of podcasting 2.0.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:14.720]   We can already do that. We've had chapters for like 15 years, at least like we there are so many
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.760]   ways to do chapters. We already, I wrote a tool to do it. The forecast, it's a free app for Mac,
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.280]   you can put chapters in your podcast, you can convert logic markers to chapters. It's great.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.120]   Any kind of wave marker, it converts automatically so you can make it in your editor, and it just
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.240]   imports them as chapters. It's so easy to do chapters, and we already have ways to do that. And so
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:37.200]   the ways you've had forever are it's embedded metadata in the file. First, we had in, in,
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.880]   M4A files, AC files, Apple made a garage band feature to make them forever a million years ago.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:49.760]   And then later on, they were added to the MP3 spec. It's an official MP3 ID3 chapter spec,
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.960]   overcast supports at Apple supports like all the big podcast app support that.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:59.200]   And so now we have like one of the podcast 2.0 things. This is from memory, forgive me if I
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.320]   have the details wrong. This has been proposed a number of times by a number of different people,
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:08.480]   but it's basically chapters in the feed. And the problem is, in reality, the world of podcasting
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:14.800]   is largely now using dynamic ad insertion, which I don't love at all, but I have to deal with it.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.680]   And so dynamic ad insertion means that any given copy of the file might have different
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.320]   timestamps than any other given copy of the file. So because they might insert ads differently
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:28.320]   for each download that are different lengths, and they do that all the time. So things that are
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:34.480]   based on fixed timestamps in a feed don't work for most publishers now. So if you're a big publisher
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:40.800]   and you're using DAI, then you can't use feed based chapters, because those timestamps are
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.880]   going to be different for every single person to download it. So it has to be embedded in the file
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.880]   or not done at all. Also, frankly, I think it's optimistic to expect those big publishers to
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:54.080]   ever do chapters, because big publishers can't even do show notes, right? So I think we're,
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:00.240]   we have to ask for minimal things here. Yeah, I'm one of those publishers that can't do show notes,
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.600]   writes, and we'll never do chapters because it's too much as too labor intensive.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.840]   But it's not if you do it as markers in your editor, it's not labor intensive.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.720]   You just use Mark.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.320]   Make a note that John Ashley, if you just drop a marker, you can use markers in the editor,
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.880]   just do it. You know, I don't actually want people skipping around in my podcast.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.920]   I want to listen from the beginning to the end. That's it, period. Yeah, actually, it's really
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:26.880]   interesting because there's actually a war over podcasting right now, thanks to Spotify and
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:32.640]   Amazon and iHeart, these big companies who want you to use their client to listen to
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.200]   podcasts, which isn't really a podcast. If it's not RSS, it ain't a podcast, baby. And
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:43.120]   they really make more money that way because they can tell advertisers a lot more about you.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.960]   And I'm resisting that, but I'm wondering if in the long run, this is resistance is futile.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.760]   Well, it depends what you're going for. You know, the podcasting has always,
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:59.120]   since its inception has always been under attack by people who wanted to lock it down into
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:04.880]   proprietary silos. And for most of podcasting's life, we didn't really have to worry about that
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:10.800]   because they always just failed miserably really until Spotify. That was the one that really
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.520]   like worked and took a big chunk out for the first time. But even that, I think, because I
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.920]   think we are seeing its limits. Spotify's, yeah, it's interesting. They're saying, whoops,
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:25.200]   we spent too much money. It didn't work. And I couldn't be happier.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:33.040]   Yeah, honestly. And so, you know, I think if you look at what podcasting is and has always been,
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:39.680]   we have this whole world of shows like ours that are in the open ecosystem that have RSS feeds.
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:45.360]   You can get an any app, play whatever app you want, you can get our show. And that world,
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:51.760]   there's no reason that world will be forced not to exist unless there is, I think, I think the
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:57.600]   one big like species ending event for that world would be if sponsors no longer bought ads in that
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.840]   format, that could be damaging to us. But what we see over again,
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.000]   I hate to say it's depressing. Well, it's more difficult maybe. But I think what we've seen over
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.040]   and over again is that this medium, the way we do it with having good relationships between us and
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:17.600]   the listeners and doing direct host reads. Oftentimes that works very, very well for direct response
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.080]   advertisers. And that's why we keep getting the same advertisers over and over again. And they
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.360]   give us the coupon code that has our show name and they can measure how many conversions they get.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.640]   And they can see, oh, our ads are actually working for them. They're making money from us and they
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:34.880]   buy ads again. That works because people listen to our shows in this format and people trust us
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:40.960]   and like us to some of these, some of them do. And so that works for us. And so whatever
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:46.240]   happens over there in Spotify, Lamb, or they have some big exclusive celebrity based show and they
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.120]   try to get people to move over. First of all, I think that is proving not to be very effective for
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:56.960]   them, for the numbers, for either the shows that become exclusive and lose all their audience,
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.880]   or for Spotify trying to keep people in and get new listeners that so far, I think that's showing
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.840]   not to work as well as they want to. But whatever happens over in worlds like that,
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.360]   as long as we keep the relationship with our audience healthy and we keep producing shows like ours,
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:19.280]   there is nothing that's going to come and take this away. It's decentralized. It's the web. It's
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:25.680]   based on the web. Same thing with NASA on Twitter, right? You can, no billionaire can come along and
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:33.680]   buy NASA on. Right. Like, I think we are fairly, I wouldn't say we're safe forever. Nothing is safe
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:41.120]   forever in tech or the world. But I think we have pretty strong defenses in open podcasting.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:47.760]   You can look at how many attacks there have been over time and how we are very resistant to change
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:54.720]   and we defend against these attacks extremely effectively. Just by the way that our medium has
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.280]   always worked and the way our audience wants things to be. Nobody likes to be told to use a different
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:04.160]   app for one or two shows than what app they prefer to use. Nobody likes to be told that they can't
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:09.120]   get their podcast where and how they want them. And so it's our job to keep making good stuff
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.480]   over here in this open world. And we can, in that way, we can largely ignore what happens in the silos.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:23.360]   Listen to Marco, everybody, from your mouth to Procter and Gamble's ear. The biggest problem
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.880]   we've had is advertisers preferring this other format, this direct ad insertion and
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.160]   preferring all the information they get from Spotify and Audible and so forth.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:39.440]   And it makes it harder for us to sell ads. We've lost a lot of advertisers to that. But you're
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:46.880]   right. The advertisers who really use us and use the host red ads and the offer codes,
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.320]   they've done, that's why we do have people over and over again with us. The other problem has
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.800]   happened is there's so many podcasts that aren't so good and don't work so well for advertisers
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.240]   and a lot of times we'll get advertisers to say, Oh yeah, we tried podcasting. It was, it didn't work.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:09.600]   It's like, okay, what can we do? What can we do? We're going through, I don't know about you,
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.120]   Marco, and I don't know what you've heard from other podcasters, but we're going through an
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:20.800]   advertising downturn that is existential. It's life threatening. Oh yeah. It's not that bad for
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.800]   our show, but it's, this is the worst ad market we've seen in probably a few years.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:30.720]   But one thing that we did on ATP a couple of years ago is we added memberships.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:36.880]   And so we diversified into that. And that's, I'm so happy we did that because that makes it a
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.960]   lot easier to take it when the ad market is down like this. Because the memberships,
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:45.200]   ultimately, I don't think they're ever going to replace the ads, just numbers wise, ads just pay
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:51.280]   more. But it's really nice to have this backstop when the ad market is terrible as it is now.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.080]   But one thing we've seen that kind of gives me hope is that the ad market throughout,
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:02.800]   I mean, geez, how long have I been podcasting 10, 11, 12 years? The ad market is cyclical. It
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.800]   always has been, it has its ups and downs. This is a down, it's down for everybody. But I don't think
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.520]   that says podcast advertising is in trouble. I think that's, I think what we're seeing is that in
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:21.360]   general, advertising right now is down everywhere. But it goes in cycles. And during the boom times,
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.640]   we don't say, hey, advertising is suspiciously great right now. No, we just cast a chance.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:34.160]   So that's true. And we have very short memories. So I think it's just important to realize when
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:38.960]   you look at the graph over time of your ad income, it has ups and downs. It always does.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.680]   This is normal. This is normal behavior. And when you're at the bottom of the down,
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.360]   it might feel like the world's never going to come back, but it will eventually.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.800]   Good. Tell that to my ad team. Okay. Actually, we have an unusual problem because
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:00.800]   foolishly, we built something that has a high overhead. And I mean, we have a two and a half
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:07.200]   million dollar a year, not so we don't have the luxury of saying, well, if advertising is down,
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.200]   we'll just weather it and go through it. Thank goodness that we did do that. And I think
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.840]   everybody who's in podcasting for real understands that the only thing that keeps
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:20.960]   podcasting alive is the community, the listeners, the people who you have a relationship, a direct
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:27.360]   relationship with and clubs, patreons, that kind of thing really give not only give you the little
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.160]   extra income, but they make a big difference in bonding the audience to you. So we two years
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.920]   ago, we created Club Twit. That was that was a huge part of it. But it's still, I mean,
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:43.200]   it's still one 10th of 1% or something. Maybe it's I would love if I get 5% of the audience to
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.840]   subscribe, we wouldn't need advertisers. But right now it's not even 1%. Most people who are
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.640]   getting something for free aren't going to start suddenly paying for it. I'm afraid.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.200]   That's a that's a problem. We don't maybe we don't have as many devoted listeners as
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.360]   accidental tech podcast. But if you are devoted, Twitter TV slash club,
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.520]   Twitter, seven bucks a year that is a month. That's all seven bucks ad free versions,
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:09.840]   all the shows, you get the discord, which is a lot of fun. You get extra stuff like,
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.960]   you know, that we do in between shows, I know terrible sales, but that's the other problem.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.200]   You can't even get a good burger for seven bucks. Can't. What are you going to get for seven bucks?
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:26.880]   Might as well just give it to us. Twit.tv slash club twit. We also, I mean, we do things Marco
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.640]   that are obviously crazy, like stream live video as we're as we're doing the shows. I mean,
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.120]   that adds huge amounts of complexity and cost to the thing. It's not how you do it. Like,
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:43.840]   I've tried doing video a handful of times in various ways. And every time I come away from it,
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.680]   thinking like, first of all, a I've learned how to make pretty great audio for my purposes.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:54.000]   I cannot make even remotely good video. So that's problem number one. I'm terrible at it.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.800]   But it's just it's also it's, as you know, it adds such a degree of complexity.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:05.200]   And cost. So it is so much harder and more expensive and more people intensive than making audio.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:10.720]   And it's yeah, I've decided a long time ago, like video is not for me. I'm just not going to.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:16.160]   Let me tell you, that's that's a strong decision. I can strongly recommend.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.320]   Yeah. If anybody asks me, I say, don't, a don't get in a podcasting for the money and be never,
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.640]   ever do video. But if you do it, the advantage of it is there is this connection, even from,
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.240]   you know, 80 or 90% of our audience is never going to or does not look,
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.280]   download the videos. I shouldn't say is never going to look at them. Because I think,
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:39.440]   you know, one in 10 times they'll maybe download a video. And so they have in their mind a sense of
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.760]   place and sense, they know what you all look like and stuff like that. And I think that does also
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.840]   build that bond that is so important to podcasting is the is the relationship.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:55.120]   Hey, everybody, it's Leo LaPorte, the founder and host of many of the Twitch podcasts. I don't
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:00.000]   normally talk to you about advertising, but I want to take a moment to do that right now.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.400]   Our mission statement at Twitch, we're dedicated to building a highly engaged community of tech
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.560]   enthusiasts. That's our audience and you, I guess, since you're listening, by offering them the
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:19.280]   knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's world. To do that, we also create
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:24.400]   partnerships with trusted brands and make important introductions between them and our audience. That's
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.920]   how we finance our podcasts, but it's also and our audience tells us this all the time.
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:35.760]   A part of the service we offer, it's a valued bit of information for our audience members. They
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:44.560]   want to know about great brands like yours. So can we help you by introducing you to our highly
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:50.240]   qualified audience and why do you get a lot with advertising on the Twitch podcasts?
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.480]   Partnering with Twitch means you're going to get, if I may say so, humbly, the gold standard in
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:00.240]   podcast advertising. And we throw in a lot of valuable services. You get a full service continuity
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:05.280]   team supporting everything from copywriting to graphic design. I don't think anybody else
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:10.800]   does this or does this as well as we do. You get ads that are embedded in our content that are
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:16.320]   unique every time I read them or hosts read them. We always over deliver on impressions.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:23.120]   And frankly, we're here to talk about your product. So we really give our listeners a
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:29.200]   great introduction to what you offer. We've got onboarding services, ad tech with pod sites.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:34.800]   That's free for direct clients. We give you a lot of reporting so you know who saw your advertisement.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:40.000]   You'll even know how many responded by going to your website. We'll also give you courtesy
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.640]   commercials that you can share across social media and landing pages. We think these are
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:49.520]   really valuable. People like me and our other hosts talking about your products sincerely
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:54.560]   and informationally. Those are incredibly valuable. You also get other free goodies,
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.360]   mentions in our weekly newsletter that's sent out to thousands of fans. We give bonus ads
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:05.360]   to people who buy a significant amount of advertising. You'll get social media promotion too.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:10.160]   But let me tell you, we are looking for an advertising partner that's going to be with this long term.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:17.360]   Visit twitter.tv/advertise. Check out our partner testimonials. Tim Broome, founder of ITProTV.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:24.480]   They started ITProTV in 2013, immediately started advertising with us and grew that company
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:31.120]   to a really amazing success. Hundreds of thousands of ongoing customers.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:36.000]   They've been on our network for more than 10 years and they say, and I'll quote Tim,
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.840]   "We would not be where we are today without the Twit Network." That's just one example.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:46.080]   Mark McCrurry, who's the CEO of Authentic, he was actually one of the first people to buy ads
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:51.680]   on our network. He's been with us for 16 years. He said, and I'm quoting, "The feedback from
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:57.280]   many advertisers over those 16 years across a range of product categories is that if ads and
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:03.120]   podcasts are going to work for a brand, they're going to work on Twit shows. I'm proud to say
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:09.760]   that the ads we do over deliver, they work really well because they're honest, they have integrity.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:14.800]   Our audience trusts us and we say, this is a great product. They believe it. They listen.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:20.160]   Our listeners are highly intelligent. They're heavily engaged. They're tech savvy. They're

[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.840]   I'm sure we have something else to do. Blood glucose. Blood glucose. This is very interesting.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:17.680]   It's a rumor. First of all, we're learning that Apple has this group, this X-D-G group
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:24.560]   that is working on. It's essentially like Google's moon shots, the Project X stuff.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:31.600]   One of the rumors that Mark Gurman has, so I'm going to give it some credence, is that Apple is
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:40.000]   getting close to doing non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. There are something like 40 million
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.680]   Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics in the United States who have to monitor the blood sugar level.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:52.240]   Right now, we do it. I'm a Type 2 diabetic. We do it with finger pricks, which is really annoying.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   Or we wear those little discs. For a long time I wore those little discs, they're still invasive,
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.000]   but they're not as bad as a finger prick. They're a continuous glucose monitor.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.520]   It would be not only a lifesaver for so many people to have non-invasive blood glucose monitoring
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:20.000]   on your wristwatch. It would be a big pile of money for Apple. According to Gurman, they are
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.600]   in proof of concept stage. This has been something that's been going on for a long time. This is
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:33.280]   coming out of that X, D, G or exploratory design group. I'm going to guess this has been going on
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:39.520]   as long as the watches existed. Yeah, remember Tim Cook kind of alluded to it years ago,
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:47.360]   like, "Oh, my watch." At least at least 2010 Steve Jobs directed the purchase of,
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.360]   I can't remember the name of the company, but it was a company that was working specifically
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:56.400]   on this technology, not on generalized health, but specifically on technology for spectrometry,
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:02.080]   for blood glucose monitoring. Huge. There is apparently the way they're doing it is there's a
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:09.040]   chip that can do spectroscopy. Believe it or not, we already have lights in the back of our Apple
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.920]   watch that's looking at blood flow and things like that. That's how it measures a heart rate.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.840]   You've seen that green light coming off of the back of your watch probably at night.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:25.280]   Well, imagine another beam going into your arm and doing spectroscopy, which is basically
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:35.680]   analyzing the component elements of your blood for glucose. That is pretty impressive. Remember,
[01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:41.360]   though, that this is a life or death proposition for many diabetics, so you can't get it wrong.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.520]   You can't be inaccurate. You almost certainly have to get FDA approval before you can do this.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:54.800]   Right? But if the FDA a few years ago did create a new fast track program to encourage
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:00.640]   these kinds of technologies, so it won't take as long as you might think to get this approved
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:06.160]   if they can deliver the goods. But it is a huge, huge problem. I was reading a whole
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:12.000]   bunch of research papers last week when this became another thing to refresh my memory.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.560]   And it's still conditional on the... This kind of technology is conditional upon
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:23.120]   what color skin do you have, how much melanin do you have, its conditional on your...
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.880]   How many tattoos do you have on your... If you're asleep, it doesn't work as well, right?
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:34.720]   That too. Right now, I think the basic idea is that it wouldn't be good enough for
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:40.800]   type 1 diabetic to monitor their blood sugar level, because that is a life or death thing.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:46.240]   It would be very... They could soon create something that's useful for people who are,
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.160]   let's say, pre-diabetic or don't realize they have blood sugar problems to get the sort of warnings
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:54.880]   that Apple gives you for like EKGs, which is not saying, "Here is your EKG. Here is what your heart
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:00.240]   is doing right now." It says, "Hey, I'm seeing data that I have not typically seen before in the past
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.960]   two months of you watching this watch. Maybe you want to bring this up with your doctor the next time,
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:10.080]   or let's trigger this into other factors that we're also monitoring to give you some...
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:14.960]   Not even necessarily a specific advice, which the FDA would regulate, but basically give you
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.360]   awareness of a sensor that's giving you a thumbs up or a thumbs down. I suspect that's
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:27.200]   probably right, the first use. There are companies. I have a account with a company called NutriSense
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:33.360]   that athletes use, bodybuilders, anybody who wants to look at their blood glucose levels,
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:41.040]   not because they're problematic, but because they want to have improved performance. I was a friend
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:48.320]   played a high school and college women's softball, and their whole team wore these CGM's
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:53.840]   because it was useful for their training. I think there is a market for this that
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:59.840]   goes beyond just health monitoring. There's a big market. I think that in the food market,
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:04.240]   this could potentially, as it grows, become devastating. As people start to realize,
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:09.920]   "Oh, that's killing you." When I eat that, when they start seeing spikes, there's all kinds of
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.320]   things. When they start seeing what's happening to their blood level, their sugar levels,
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:18.080]   based on what they're eating, they're going to stop eating the things that some people will not
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.680]   care, but there's a lot of people. Once you have that watch, once you see the graph,
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.920]   you don't measure what matters. What you measure matters. When you start measuring it,
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:34.320]   you start paying attention to it. People will start to get into that. It pays attention to how
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.720]   much gas you're using when you're driving, and people start to change my behavior when I see that.
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:43.360]   It changes how I use the gas because I'm trying to get the most and just out of, for no reason.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:50.240]   Other than just, it's a challenge. At the same time, I think you'll see people starting to get,
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.600]   if everybody can put it on the wrist or a lot of people can put it on the wrist,
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:57.520]   you're going to suddenly see a lot of people eating in a certain way that tries to manage that
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.800]   into a much tighter band than what it was before, because up until now, they're completely unconscious
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.680]   to it. Unless you're diabetic, you have no idea what's going on with your blood, your sugar levels.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:11.200]   I think that's spot on. Think of all the times that you've seen on social media, people posting
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.960]   their heart rate graph off their Apple Watch in a funny way saying, "Ah-hah, try to guess what
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:23.920]   time today my partner told me that we're having a baby, AC is one spike." You don't notice at the
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.480]   time, but you see, "Oh, wow, isn't that cool? My pulse went up to 112 just on getting this
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.320]   incredibly great news." I think that that's exactly the same thing. If it doesn't tell you,
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:42.720]   here is the number for your blood glucose right now, and this is Reid, if it tells you that,
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.560]   "Hey, remember how you felt like crap around three o'clock?" You see that graph and you realize,
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:52.640]   "Oh, there was a spike around that time. I ate that entire box of marshmallow peeps."
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:28:00.480]   Maybe I should not be doing that thing. That could be just as transforming as a lot of other
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.560]   things. It's worse than peeps, because I know I happen to know that if I have more than two
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:11.280]   pieces of bread, I'd have to go to bed. Everybody knows the peeps are loaded with sugar, but there's
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:17.440]   stuff you're eating that's loaded with sugar you don't know. You're peanut butter. You suddenly see
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:23.840]   those spikes. I wore a CGM for months, and it is eye-opening, and it does change your behavior.
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:30.640]   Even eating a lot of rice, it's like I had a big bowl of rice. It's like, "Oh, that's not... I
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.840]   thought I was eating healthy, but it turns out that it was really spiking my blood sugar for some reason."
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:39.040]   You also learn other things like you can eat certain things, or for instance, taking a short
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:44.880]   walk after you eat. There's all sorts of interesting tweaks you can make to your lifestyle.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:53.840]   Fascinating. I think this is going to sell a ton of watches, and you've got to think it's kind of
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:59.520]   moonshots and apt analogy for this, because it's like a space race. Just look at the lawsuits
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:07.760]   between LiveCore and Apple over their EKG monitors. Apple has got to have the utmost secrecy on this,
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:14.880]   because you know Abbott and Dexcom, the makers of those CGM monitors, they've got spies in
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.200]   Cupertino trying to look over the hedges. What is Apple doing? They would like to do this.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.080]   If Apple does have hexo, the stock prices for both companies went down 3% when this rumor came
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:32.000]   out in Bloomberg. If Apple does this, it changes everything. But forget the business angle on this.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.800]   It is huge for health, and it would be amazing.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.120]   And Cook has talked about that. Cook has said the biggest impact we're going to make is on health,
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:45.360]   and when he said it, it was like, really? That's not the first thing going on.
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:50.160]   We've talked about this. What are the tenfuls for Apple in the next generation of Apple? Is it a VR
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:58.560]   headset? Is it a VR AR with your earbuds? Is it a car? Or is it health? And I think health is the
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:04.800]   absolute one the bet on right now. And I'm using right now, I'm trying to get rid of all the
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:12.080]   COVID-19 wait. And I started doing the Apple fitness stuff. And it's just the fact that it's
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:17.440]   on an iPad and it's tied into your watch. And the whole thing is like, "This is pretty cool."
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:23.200]   I've been doing the rowing. You row a lot harder when there's somebody cracking the way.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:28.160]   And they're really well done. They're very good. And the fact that your watch goes right up on the
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:31.760]   screen or on your iPad, I watch it on the TV with an Apple TV.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.680]   When someone who's like a snob, a horrible snob about production value, like,
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.080]   I have a hard time. I can't even listen to NPR. Like if someone does a call in, I'm like,
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:45.840]   "Okay, I can't listen to this anymore." And so the fact that Apple does what it does with the
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.480]   fitness stuff, I'm like, "Oh, I can watch this." And I even feel more inspired because the video on
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:54.800]   the audio is so good. It's interesting because I also do Peloton. They don't yet have the...
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:31:01.600]   Peloton has a couple of trainers who are so engaging that you watch because of them.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:04.720]   I don't think Apple yet has... I don't know. Maybe I haven't seen all of them. Have you found
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.760]   somebody in a fitness plus that you go, "Oh, I'm just going to take their class."
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:11.520]   I just bounce around. I'm like, "It's more about what I'm taking than anything else."
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:15.440]   Apple doesn't want that. They don't want to spike. They chop the heads of all the daisies
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.480]   because they want them all to be the same height. And that's where...
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.600]   They're all really good and eight. They're good. They're really good at diversity.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:26.240]   I mean, Apple's got all backgrounds and all things and they're making sure that you have all the...
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.080]   Well, everyone of them uses A.S.L. when they sign on and sign off,
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:33.760]   which is a little performative to me, I think.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:37.760]   They're pretty committed to it. It's definitely...
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:40.720]   Yeah. Accessibility at Apple is a religion.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:46.560]   It's one of the few companies. I don't think they do it to look good. They do it because
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:54.160]   from the very top down, they are very, very intense about accessibility and inclusion.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:59.520]   According to German, Apple's taking a different approach to those
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:05.360]   concontinuous glucose monitor patches, which, by the way, you have to place every two weeks.
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.520]   They're using a chip technology known as silicon photonics. And I think they acquired this,
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.800]   by the way. I think there's a company they acquired. And a measurement process called
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:19.120]   optical absorption spectroscopy uses lasers to emit specific wavelengths of light into an area
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:25.520]   below the skin. Not your blood. It's looking at interstitial fluid substances that leak out of
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:30.320]   capillaries that can be absorbed by glucose. The light is then reflected back to the sensor in a
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:34.960]   way that indicates the concentration of glucose. This is hard to do. Remember, Google had...
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:40.000]   Was it verily? They were doing the contact lenses and they shut it down. They couldn't do it.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:44.480]   Or with Google, you never know. Maybe the engineers got bored and moved on.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:52.640]   You talked about a hard contact lens with radio created power and sensors built into it.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:56.880]   That's an order of magnitude more difficult than Strat this thing on our list.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:03.040]   I'd be even interested if Apple decided to go with a big break and say that this is important
[01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:08.320]   enough and interesting enough to us that we are going to create a complementary sensory band
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:13.040]   that has its own battery, has its own sensor pack that can communicate with your phone and your
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:18.960]   Apple watch. So yes, you'll be either wearing something on two wrists or you'll be having this
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:23.920]   other thing that's on a watch band. Because if the limiting factor is how do we get all of this
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.560]   into an Apple watch form factor, how do we get into a form factor where it doesn't kill the battery
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:34.320]   in three or four hours? And they can solve that by saying here is a stylish, just plastic band,
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:40.320]   so to speak, that is on your alternative wrist. And we can deliver these kinds of things like
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.240]   in 2024 instead of 2027. That would be interesting.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:54.800]   Tiffany is a extreme athlete. Isn't she, Marco? I'm trying to remember.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.800]   I mean, I wouldn't describe either of us as extreme athletes or even necessarily athletes,
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:05.760]   but we exercise. Oh, good. Okay. No, you know what? I'm confusing you with
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:11.760]   the Adamanks, Tada Manks. Yeah, his wife. They're both crazy.
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:19.760]   It makes us look terrible. Yeah, they make us look bad. I wish he could use a zoom filter of like
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:27.440]   sullen of like load. So it just so it doesn't look quite so much like I'm slacking off as much
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:33.920]   as I am. I holler. I get my heart rate up by watching Formula One drive to survive. That keeps me
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:42.880]   exercising. Isn't that exciting? I tell you, I'm excited. Some schools have banned Apple watches
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:48.240]   according to Inc. I don't know. I don't like this headline. Schools are banning the Apple
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:56.160]   watches at times who ditch yours at the office. What? What? What got me to click Jason Aton?
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.240]   What? What are you talking? Inc has a lot of clickbaity stuff. I almost I almost don't even
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:06.960]   notice it when there's a headline that has ink attached to it. Okay, they're the they're the
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:12.400]   king of Tim Cook always does these three things every morning. Should you? And it's like, okay,
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:16.480]   as soon as you're promoted on Twitter, I stop reading you. Let's just I'm going to tell you that
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:21.200]   right now. So is that I mean, I tried out the that new artifact app by the Instagram people.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:27.600]   Yeah, which is and I I'm still I'm still trying it, but I've been using it for
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:34.880]   many five, six days. And the main problem I'm having is content on the web sucks. Yeah, I keep
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:41.200]   it's so bad. Like I all the headlines are those like clickbaity headlines. And I'm having a very
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.560]   hard time finding good quality material in there even and I try and you know, I try not to feed
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:50.240]   the algorithm bad data like if it's something really clickbaity like that, I won't even click on it.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.880]   Well, that's the question is it getting better because it's supposedly learning.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:57.040]   It does. It does. It does get better. I've had it since I've had it for a few weeks since the
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:02.240]   early trial and it does get very, very good. My problem with it is that it does the most annoying
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.560]   thing about Apple news, which is like, Oh, great. There's a there's a great story. I want to open
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.960]   it in Chrome so I can bookmark it elsewhere. And no, it wants to keep it inside this app. Well,
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.640]   okay, well, at least you're okay. Well, it's a sharing panel so I can sure no, it'll give you a
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:19.840]   URL that will open it with the app. I really, and it's like, it makes it Apple news. I hate that.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:25.040]   That's not acceptable. Yeah. And yeah. And like, like 70% of my day is doing research and keeping
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.280]   up with news and okay, that's something I want to follow up on. If I can't take it out of your app,
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.000]   I can't use your app. This is analogous to our podcast discussion. This is that move away from
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:42.480]   RSS news and shareable links to in app listening, reading, whatever. Marco, do you use an RSS reader?
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:48.240]   Yeah, I use both. I've I never stopped using an RSS reader. Like, I've been using them the whole
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:55.520]   time. I currently use a read kit on the desktop and unread on the on iOS. And they're both excellent.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.680]   It's also a net newswire, which I bounced in and out of, you know, I was glad I see them come back.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:05.360]   That's great. Yeah, that's it's a great project. I love that newswire. No, our RSS is great. And
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:11.200]   it's never stopped being great. You know, it and in fact, you know, what what people love,
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:16.240]   like, you know, some of the reviews, like a for overcast are people basically decrying algorithmic
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:21.520]   feeds and saying they're happy they found a podcast app that is just what they subscribe to. Like,
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:29.040]   it just hears a list of shows. I want to see every episode they release. That's what RSS does
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:34.960]   for the web RSS that and we've gotten so far away from that in most consumer applications
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:40.480]   that that is refreshing to people. And it's kind of it's kind of sad that most people don't even
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:45.440]   know that this whole thing has been here the whole time in both web and podcasting. Like, it's
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.480]   people don't realize how good they could have had it all these years. But at least, at least
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.960]   we're coming around now never died, even though everybody thought it was dead after Google Reader
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:01.680]   went away and it never died. I use I use readers several hours a day and partly because of just
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.560]   what would Marco was saying, don't give me curation. Yeah. Our EED. I thank you. Don't
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.040]   don't give me curation. Give me timeline. Just give me the fire hose. Let me figure out how to
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:16.480]   tame that down if I need to. But it's, you know, Marco's point is we all taken even if you're using
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:21.920]   that you still get just like an artifact. There's too much link bait. Here's here's my top two
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.920]   stories from artifact. This high speed train goes underwater to connect London to Amsterdam
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:33.920]   directly. And this tiny smartphone accessory gives you a fantastic superpower.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:41.120]   Those are the top two headlines. And then Patrick Warburton is done apologizing for family guy.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.160]   No, it might have been something you'd like mine is Zalinski fires top Ukrainian
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:50.160]   military. See, that's a good that's real. So maybe it's me. Okay, well,
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:53.760]   this is stuff from something called the mad or I don't know what the mad or
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:59.600]   single skepticism in Biden's effort. Those are my top one. I think I should. I need to I need to
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:05.920]   fix my let me give you mine. My just the top screen here is fast company. Clickup wants to be your

[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.600]   Power. Okay, that's the same one as me. Yeah, that's a mashable Android is adding a ton of new
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:21.280]   features to your phone. Supreme Court signal skepticism on Biden's identity. Yep. Albert

[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:33.280]   worked out why that's Link fate. She looks crazy all the time. All the time.
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:40.000]   That's just that's her thing as her brand. In the white Lotus, she's like pissed off the whole
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.240]   season. It's every it's every thing she said. Like that's her. She's got RBF. That's why. And I
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:50.400]   whoa. Peru police find pre Hispanic mummy in ex delivery man's bag.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.680]   That's physics. Click on those and then you get more of them that you have to it's the
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:02.160]   principal. Oh, I'm talking on TikTok. Like I have I have a bunch of different accounts on
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.160]   different phones on TikTok. And I'm like this phone is the is the how to phone. This is the
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:10.960]   comedy phone. Yeah, you should be very careful. Yeah. Like I have I have one phone that will
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:18.000]   deliver you. What is the new meme that has a cage in it? You know, in TikTok, it's the you know,
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:24.320]   the there's one where it's from the unbearable likeness of great or unbearable likeness of
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:28.960]   greatness. No, no, not being. That's the old one. The greatness is the one with Nick Cage. Oh, the
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.200]   new one. Yes. It's hysterical where he goes like this with his ring into his fist and yeah.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:37.920]   But there's there's there's a meme where it's Nick Cage looking really upset and it cuts over to
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.400]   Pedro Pascal. He's got this like crazy look on his face. And it's like it's always like, you know,
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:47.680]   new hire realizing that this office is crazy that cuts over to Pedro Pascal. It's like the whole
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:52.640]   office already knowing that like we already know it's crazy. And and but I have one that just
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:56.080]   delivers that. But if I get something else, I immediately go through it. I'm like, I want to
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:00.400]   change the the young this this phone is this algorithm. Like you can't don't those aren't moving.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.160]   I'm looking I'm looking through know that meme and knowing your mean, unfortunately,
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:10.080]   there's a lot of the Nicholas Cage. There's there's the look. This one. This one here. It's
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:16.880]   how to get burned. This one. There's there's 10,000 of them. Oh, I'm sorry. They got it. Oh,
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:22.000]   okay. I don't know what it is, but it's like 10,000. There's 10,000 of these. I mean, like it's
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.560]   but it's like, is that from the same movie or two different movies? No, the same movie. It's the
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:34.960]   same clip. It cuts over to it. And it's just it's like, but yeah, I trained I trained one TikTok
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:38.960]   instance to just just give you this for half an hour and watch those so much fun.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:44.240]   This just shows you know, your meme is no longer Oh, corrupt because everybody's moved to TikTok.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.920]   So forget it. You know, it's not these meme generators anymore.
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:53.840]   Well, you made me think of something I wanted to bring up, but I don't remember what it is.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:04.400]   It's asking me to invite my friends to artifact Renee Richie, Jason Calicanis,
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.080]   Esther Dyson.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:12.560]   Well, it thinks I know some people. I do know Renee Richie.
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:16.240]   Let's see. What else? What else is going on here?
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:25.680]   I you you, you, me you who cares you use going after Apple. I know, you know, that's good. This is
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:32.640]   a this is a almost as good as finding a 5,000 year old Peruvian dummy mummy in your mailbag.
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:37.600]   A woman who got locked out of her Apple account minutes after her iPhone was stolen,
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:44.000]   had $10,000 taken from her bank account. And she says Apple was not helpful at all.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.520]   It's too long to be link bait. And it's a true story. And actually it's a cautionary tale.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:57.680]   It happens on Android as well. These phones that unlock with a pin will give you a chance to change
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:03.120]   your password once you're in, right? So this is a Wall Street Journal story.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:08.800]   It's about how iPhone thieves lock people out of their Apple accounts by using their passcodes
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:15.680]   to access the phone before changing the device's password and then, you know, stealing funds from
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:21.280]   the account and so forth. This is a story. It's a specific and personal attack where they
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:25.760]   basically watch someone who's using their phone, wait for them to unlock it and then just grab
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:31.360]   it and run. And during this is unlocked. So they're looking over your shoulder at a bar or whatever,
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:38.240]   you unlock your phone. Like when he was in the office Kanye, we know that Kanye's
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:44.400]   pin was what? 000, 000, right? So it's like just like that. You look over to somebody's office of
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.560]   shoulder in the bar or wherever and now you got their pin, then you steal their phone because now
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:53.040]   you can get in. Oh, but it wasn't even stealing the pin. It was literally just grab it and run
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:57.280]   while it's still unlocked. Well, it's unlocked. Okay. Yeah, exactly. So while it's unlocked,
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.720]   then you're basically free to change the passcode so that the person can't, assuming they can get
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:06.800]   their hands on another phone. Anyway, they can't lock out your, you can't lock out the account.
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:11.280]   And in that time, they have plenty of time to access banking apps or anything else like that.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.360]   Well, no, the whole, the whole here is they do get the passcode. They, they
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:20.960]   watch you. Yeah, they watch you. They get the passcode. And then, and then the, the, the kind of shocking
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.520]   revelation here that I think a lot of us techies didn't know I certainly didn't, is that with an
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.840]   iPhone, if you, if you have the physical possession of the phone and you, and you know, it's passcode,
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:34.640]   you can reset the Apple ID password. Okay. And then that, then you have everything,
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:38.880]   because then you have the Apple ID, you have a phone that's trusted by the Apple ID, you have
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:42.960]   anything that's locked by Face ID or Touch ID, you have the passcode and you can change the passcode.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:47.360]   So you can, and then you, you can log into iCloud with the Apple ID, you can kick all their other
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:53.600]   devices out, you can change the password. So that, it's that loophole of being able to turn a passcode
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:58.080]   and a phone into an Apple ID that I think I didn't know that was even possible. And there's no way
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:04.400]   to turn that off. And, and it's incidentally the same on Android phones. And, and, and increasingly,
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:10.800]   this is becoming your proof that you are you, you're, you're, your device. And that's because
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:14.640]   of biometrics. Now, if you all, now obviously you can't turn off a passcode, you can't use
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:20.400]   biometrics without a passcode. But if you had a modern iPhone that used Face ID, you'd be, you
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.920]   wouldn't have to worry as much because you're not going to be entering the passcode in public.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:31.920]   Right? Most of the time. And this is, I think what this teaches us is that we have to treat the
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:36.720]   passcode to our phone the same way we would treat a password to our Apple ID account because you can
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:41.360]   turn one into the other. And so, you know, you shouldn't, you shouldn't have somebody looking over
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:45.760]   your shoulder easily when you're typing in your Apple ID password. Well, you need to treat your
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:50.880]   phone's passcode by that same level of physical in-person security of, you know, so first of all,
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:54.880]   you might want to consider an off a numeric passcode. You can, where it actually works like a password
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:00.240]   in that way. And if not, if you're going to stick with numeric, at least be very careful when you're
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.400]   entering it. Like look around you, like make sure no one is looking over your shoulder or can easily
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:08.240]   see it. You know, if you have to hold the phone close to your chest or, you know, go kind of duck
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:14.560]   away somewhere to do it, that's worth doing because if somebody has your Apple ID and your phone and
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:20.400]   your passcode, everything you have in your digital life or accessible via apps in your digital life,
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:26.320]   like your bank account, that's all then compromised. There is a setting I'm looking in the iPhone
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:32.560]   that says turn off passcode, but your Apple Pay cards will be removed, your Apple Watch will
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:36.720]   not automatically unlock, you will not be able to use this passcode to reset your Apple ID if you
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:44.240]   forget it. So, yeah, I think your solution is better, Mark. Marco, just don't let just be careful.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.680]   You know, same way you would be when you go to your bank and you enter in your your ID for your ATM.
[01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:57.360]   Exactly. Okay. The Joanne Stern article talks about how it's not just it's shoulder surfing,
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:01.360]   and also just groups of two or three thieves who go to a bar, befriend victims often asking them to
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.280]   open up Snapchat or some of the social media platform, and then during the interaction they
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:09.760]   would try to observe the victim. And some of them are being intimidated by the violence into
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:15.600]   giving up the passcode. In addition to in addition to stealing the phone itself, some are being
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:23.280]   drugged. It's it's tough. And apparently this is these cases being reported worldwide. So, it's
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:28.320]   not something that is just someone being clever or stupid. It's hopefully it's something that
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:33.680]   Google and Apple can figure out how to address, but it's hard to it's hard to know how do you
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:41.200]   protect the user against someone has the phone, someone has the passcode. That seems like a really
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:47.360]   tough thing to try to protect against. So I'm changing it to alpha numeric. That's an interesting
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:52.720]   theory, Marco, that if it's long and alpha numeric, at least it'd be harder for somebody to shoulder
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:58.800]   surf. And more importantly, it kind of teaches you this is a password. Right. You know, like,
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:03.920]   it's so you would you would you might be a little bit more conscious of the ability for other people
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:09.520]   to see what you're typing if it looks and works more like a password. Right. Yeah. And I use long
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:13.760]   phrases for stuff that I have to type in. I have to admit I pulled back a little bit during COVID
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:18.880]   because it couldn't open my I get my name because I have a long I have a long passphrase and I do
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:22.400]   everything I can, especially in public. I have to do everything I can to use biometrics. So I
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:29.200]   don't have to tie it in. And usually my my phone is pretty like it'll close up really fast, although
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:33.520]   if someone got a hold of it, they'd be able to keep it keep it open. I do think that there
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:37.120]   you could probably set some higher security setting where if it gets away from your if it
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:41.120]   moves away from your watch, like you could have one of those things like suddenly my phone's away
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:45.280]   from my watch and it just closes, you know, like it could just require you to log in if you're more
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:50.560]   than 15 feet from the watch kind of thing because it has that data. So you know, you could do
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.320]   something like that where someone runs away to immediately. I mean, we say that, you know,
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.880]   obviously this is much more devastating because you can get into so many things.
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:02.880]   Now, we, you know, a lot of the things that have been done by Apple and Google have been really
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:05.840]   effective at keeping people from stealing other people's phones. You know, the fact that it's
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.440]   really hard to sell the phone now has definitely cut down on on phone.
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:17.280]   There was a story about even, you know, 2020 M1 Max being so hard because of activation lock to
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:23.440]   reuse that they just scrapped. Yeah. Yeah, because it's, you know, and so that's so it's pretty,
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.720]   they're, I mean, our phones have never been more secure, but but the problem is is now that if you
[01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:32.960]   can, if you find a way through that, but I do think that a proximity against them, you know,
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:38.000]   it would obviously get you to buy a watch as well as a phone, but a proximity gear, I have to admit
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.840]   that when I'm in public, I'm, I'm pretty conscious of my phone. Like, you know, like it's, it's not a,
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:47.920]   well, it's now your idea, right? It's everything. I definitely take it pretty seriously. I take my
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:54.400]   phone really seriously at, you know, and I don't, you know, I, I generally don't set it down, like in
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:59.360]   general, you know, well, I also, I noticed I have it turned on to unlock. If Face ID doesn't work to
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:04.960]   unlock with my watch, now I really have a problem because somebody just has to be sitting next to
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:10.480]   me and they can unlock it. Right. So I'm gonna turn that feature off too. It's easy to get
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.520]   lulled into this false. I mean, with the, with your headphones, with your, with your phone,
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:20.960]   you think of it as an extension of like yourself and of your, it's like, like your eyeglasses.
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:26.800]   It's like you forget that you are sitting on a New York subway next to the door holding a
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:33.040]   $1,100 computer in your loosely in your hand and how easily someone who is on their way out, who
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.720]   seen you not paying attention, just grab it and go before the before the doors close. And I mean,
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:43.520]   I try to, I have to beat myself into remembering these, these sort of things. It's one of the
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.840]   reasons why I have more paperback books in my bag now, because if there are places where I don't
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:52.400]   want to be holding a $1,000 phone in my hand, I can still, you know, read some PG Woodhouse or
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:55.520]   whatever, instead of having to be alone with my thoughts, which is of course, anathema.
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:00.240]   Who wouldn't want to read PG Woodhouse instead of being alone with their thoughts?
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:06.720]   Here's the story from Vice in motherboard, perfectly, perfectly good Mac books from 2020 are being
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:12.240]   sold for scrap because of activation lock. And it started because a reseller,
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:17.280]   MacBook refurbisher, John Bumstead tweeted, how many of you out there would like a two-year-old
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:22.000]   M1 MacBook? Well, too bad, because your local recycler just took out all the activation locked
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.680]   logic boards and ground them into carcinogenic dust. And it's the T2 security chip. And this is
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:32.480]   where this is a tough balance for Apple because this activation lock does protect you from getting,
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:40.320]   you know, iPhone Zephth has gone way down because of it. But at the same time, you know, it means
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:44.000]   the full functionality of these devices is not available unless you unlock it first.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.080]   I think that you need to, I mean, that's just the process if you're going to sell it or you're
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:54.640]   going to do something. You just got to do it. You've done this. I've forgot to do that, right?
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:58.560]   We have iPads around the studio that I can't get into because-
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:02.080]   Oh, yeah. You know, I have two of them that I think that they're going to be available in
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:04.400]   64,000 years or something like that. So it's
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:11.040]   important to that. But he's talking about the fact that every time you enter a bad
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:15.360]   code, it gets a lot of the weight gets longer and longer.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.480]   They're one of them. It's 64,000 years. And so the-
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:20.800]   That's a dedicated of you. That's good.
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:25.760]   Yeah, yeah, exactly. But yeah, I think that, you know,
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:31.120]   it's like, though, when you sell something that's expensive or you have something that's
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:35.840]   expensive, it takes time to unwrap that. I mean, some things are easy, but with your car,
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:39.680]   there's a registration. Yeah, that's true. There's codes. There's things that have to be done to
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:44.000]   legally hand something over. So when people are reselling it, a reseller just has to, like,
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.720]   if you're going to sell it to somebody, you're going to have to make sure that you go through the,
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:52.800]   you know, across the teas and dot the eyes. And if you're buying from eBay, you know,
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:56.800]   they're going to probably make sure that that's happening because they'll get a bad,
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:58.480]   they'll get a one-star. Yeah.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:02.880]   They don't. That's it. Yeah. One of the biggest problems is that you have so many companies that
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:07.600]   will buy Macbooks by the hundreds and they do, like, a two or three-year upgrade cycle.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:12.320]   And maybe they- This is just a- These hundred laptops, they're just something they need to
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:17.440]   get off their current inventory. And so maybe they will take the time to reset all of them.
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:21.520]   Maybe they won't. And so that's how they re-enter the channel. Supposedly, there is-
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:27.360]   I've- Isn't there a way that you- If you can prove that you bought it, you can go through a lot of
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:32.480]   paperwork with Apple and they will allow our remote reset. You won't be able to get back
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:37.040]   into the actual date, of course, but they will allow someone to set it up as a new Mac.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:40.080]   I have two of the iPads that I'm looking at taking. I think you can take it to the Apple
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:43.040]   store and if you prove that you bought them- You have to have that with them, though.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:46.640]   You have to have them. Well, or if you bought them from the Apple store.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:48.320]   Oh, and they'll know. Okay. Yeah.
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:53.680]   All that data's there. And so I think that- And I have to admit,
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:56.640]   the one thing I would highly recommend, I know people like to buy a lot of things. You can find
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:00.640]   a new Apple product. Just go to the Apple store. I have bought them from all these different
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:04.160]   outlets. It is not- I stopped doing that like a decade ago. It did not work.
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:10.880]   But buy them from the Apple store, buy the Apple care, and just it's all there. It's all living
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:15.600]   inside of the environment. Just to relax into this deep, warm, developing glass of Apple.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.760]   But you go- You go- And what here's the deal is that you buy it from the AT&T store. It's a
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:24.240]   disaster. No, right. You buy it from Amazon. It's a disaster. Like it's- They're all disasters,
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:28.000]   other than just buying it from the Apple store. It is- And it's just been so frustrating.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.720]   Because I- Same thing. I was like, "Oh, I'm somewhere where there's not an Apple store. I'm just
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:34.080]   going to buy it or whatever. And I needed it." Nope. Let go and let Apple- Just let me-
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.440]   Just let me- I paid over and over again for- Yep.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:40.960]   Wandering off. It's your mistake for wandering off the reservation.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:44.800]   Yeah, exactly. Apple loves you. And Apple has a marvelous plan for your life.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.920]   Give yourself to Apple willingly. Oh, my soul to the company store.
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:57.840]   Now, Apple has also been rewarding its shareholders. I just saw a story on Seeking Alpha that Apple-
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:03.840]   Remember Apple used to have like a $150 billion in cash. It's gone way down because
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:13.120]   they've been buying back stock and paying dividends. The company's spending about $110 billion a year
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:20.640]   in buybacks and dividends. They are now down to a mere $49 billion in net cash.
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:27.040]   Practically out of cash. Practically out of money. It is significant because they're spending
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:32.320]   that cash on things like Apple TV plus shows and things like that. Yeah.
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:39.680]   They could probably buy Twitter. They could just buy Twitter. Just. That's like buying a rental car.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.800]   It's like, "Who wants it at this point?" It's- The previous owner did not take care of it, sir.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:54.320]   Or an old cop car, right? Yeah. But yeah, it's- I mean, it is annoying that like-
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.880]   At least Apple hasn't been like engaging in mass layoffs. It's really annoying when you see all
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:03.280]   these tech companies that have been spending billions of dollars. Google spent something like
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:08.960]   $60 billion last year in stock buybacks, which does nothing but profit the people who are
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:15.920]   shareholders inside the company. It makes investors happy. But now they are also laying off 12,000
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:20.720]   people. And you have to ask yourself, "How many of those?" If they simply said that we're going to
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:26.240]   hold- We're going to do $30 billion with a buybacks. How many jobs? How many projects could they have
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:32.080]   kept alive? And yeah, $50 billion. That's not as if I got that much on me right now. It's still
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:39.120]   an impressive amount of money. But when you talk about- That cash reserve is Apple's screw you money,
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.440]   so to speak, to investors and to basically the rest of the market. If they want to have a losing
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:47.440]   product for years and years and years while they figure out the market or perfect the technology,
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:54.640]   if they want to make a really key opportunistic acquisition, you want that $100 billion instead
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:59.280]   of just $50 billion. Because sooner or later, you only have $20 billion. And now if you get into
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:03.600]   trouble, if the unforeseen happens, you don't have as much of a space cushion left over.
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:08.560]   So I don't think it's a disaster, but it's notable that Apple is another company that has been
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:14.880]   buying itself back, hopefully not shooting itself in the foot and limiting what it can do in the
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:19.520]   future in the process. And it really isn't buying itself back. I mean, you could buy yourself back,
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:25.840]   but that's not what Apple's just pushing everybody's value up. And we have to remember that one of
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:31.600]   the largest groups of stockholders at any company in Silicon Valley is are the employees.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:36.720]   And so the issue is, is that it's a pretty sensitive subject and it gives Apple a huge
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:41.040]   competitive advantage to have the cash to be able to keep on moving them. Even when things are
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:45.280]   wherever they are, they can keep on moving that stock price up or stabilizing it in a way. I can
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:50.480]   tell you I have friends at some of the companies that have had huge drops and it definitely affects
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:55.760]   morale. When you see your stock options that were worth a million dollars worth
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:02.000]   200,000, you think about it every day at work. And so to them, it just feels like they lost
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:12.240]   $800,000. And so it's not a... I think that has more to do with employees and morale than it has
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:16.560]   to do with almost anything else for a company to stabilize the stock price. And Apple's been able
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:20.160]   to do that really effectively by buybacks. I didn't like it at first. I thought it was like,
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.560]   "Hute." I thought Apple should just... You're lucky to be here. Enjoy your stock.
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:28.480]   Well, Stitchops always said that. I don't want to go public because then everybody will be watching
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:31.840]   their stock prices instead of doing their work doing their job. Hey, we did just...
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:38.240]   But it's just from our Discord, this is the new Apple Fitness Plus program. You might enjoy this.
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:40.480]   I think... I don't know.
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:47.760]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:50.480]   I think this is what I... I can't wait to do.
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:52.480]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:55.120]   Yeah, like I'm going to have a body like that.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:58.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:04.640]   Please. Hey, all right. Let's wrap it up with picks and so forth. But you know what? This
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:08.640]   might be a good time since Apple is spending a lot of money and Apple TV Plus is getting better
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:14.160]   and better. And I'm just wondering, Marco, if there's anything you watch on Apple TV Plus or
[01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:19.280]   anywhere these days that you think people should be watching besides that fabulous fitness video?
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:23.360]   Yeah, because that's really the thing I'm watching most.
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:27.440]   Yeah. Yeah. It's a body by Vindiot.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:33.520]   I mean, like everyone else, I'm waiting for Ted Lasso to start again. But ultimately,
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:37.040]   I really want severance. Me too. I'm like hurting for some severance.
[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.520]   They left us hanging, man. We were just hanging.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.480]   Oh my God. Yeah, that's not what I'm waiting for.
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:44.480]   I'm waiting for it. Like it's... Yeah.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:49.040]   I think that Apple... Oops, sorry. Hit the wrong button.
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:51.360]   You do. Oh, okay. Hit the wrong button. I was trying to move.
[01:59:51.360 --> 02:00:00.640]   The... I bounced up. I think Apple's starting to get its legs under it.
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:05.360]   You know, like I think that I'm... I feel that way totally. The first few years, Apple TV Plus was
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:10.560]   unremarkable compared to Netflix or HBO. And now they've got some of the best stuff on TV.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:15.840]   I love slow hoses. Yeah. I think that I was like... I felt like the first round
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:19.520]   was a lot of Brussels sprouts. Like, but not only in certain...
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:24.720]   You know, like... But I was just like, oh, this is not... Everything felt heavy and everything felt
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:29.520]   like it was important. And I just didn't... I just was like, oh, okay, I can't. And foundation,
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:33.360]   I really wanted... I mean, I was so excited about foundation. I made it through like three episodes
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:38.480]   and was like, okay, I can't... Yeah, I didn't finish it. And then... Watch sharper the other night.
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:43.680]   Terrible. Terrible. And did you see shrinking the... I've heard good things about shrinking.
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:47.200]   I haven't seen it. Have you seen it? Yeah. I haven't seen it. Yeah. I want it. It looks really good.
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:50.400]   Yeah. And then there was the other one about the... What's this? Hello tomorrow.
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:53.840]   That looks interesting. I actually want to see that. It's the... I'm really interested in it.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:01:02.080]   Retro future. Yeah. So anyway... So Ted Lasso coming back in March, but here's the question.
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:05.920]   It looks like Apple is hiring somebody to put ads in it.
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:11.520]   I wonder... I thought about that a lot. I saw that article come out and I think it has more to do
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.760]   with sports. So I don't know if they're going to put ads into the
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:23.680]   creative, the narrative work, but I think that where it does make sense is MLS. So to think about
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:28.240]   how you're going to put ads into your... Because man, I'll tell you that's what's really valuable
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:33.920]   in sports is ads because people are there and they stay there and it's live. And they...
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:35.440]   There's one of the things that... So I think that... Yeah.
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:39.120]   If I was... I think that that makes... Because I was like, really? Are they going to...
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:43.920]   Are they going to ruin this? I just ruin it with the ads and...
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:48.240]   This is the main story here. From the Verge, Jay Peters writing in the Verge,
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:53.200]   "Apple's hired an advertising executive to help build a TV plus ads." Actually, no. Sorry.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:58.560]   Comes from the information. Let's give the information credit because that's a good scoop from Sahil Patel.
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:04.400]   Apple's hired. Also, Lauren Fry, a TV and digital video advertising executive.
[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:11.680]   And it could be an ad... It could be an advertised like an ad tier. You're not going to pay for Apple TV
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:16.400]   plus... I mean, but you're going to Rock Jads. They have ads. So it could be...
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.720]   Baseball games, don't they? I think they do. Yeah, I think so. I don't know why I got the
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:25.680]   impression it was Ted Lasso. Maybe somebody else made that assumption because it doesn't say
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:32.160]   Ted Lasso in the information story. All right. Yeah. So it could be an ad layer. It could be...
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:37.760]   Apple, obviously, Apple TV plus, they're trying to get out to everywhere. So they put it on all
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:42.800]   these TVs. And the problem is that the performance of Apple TV plus is so much lower on the TVs than
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:50.160]   it is on the Apple TV. That it's kind of a bummer that they did that. But... But you're going to
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:55.280]   watch Netflix, Disney, plus HBO, see if they start putting ads in their episodic content. If they do,
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:59.280]   I'll be pissed that then Apple could do it. But I don't think Apple's going to be the first to do
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:02.880]   it by any reason. And they already start with like six minutes of ads before every episode of
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:07.200]   everything we have to skip through. It's awful. Yeah. It could just have something to do with
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:12.480]   embedded ads. Like when they basically digitally put in, oh, here's a brand of cereal that they're
[02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:17.520]   drinking at the end of this place. Yeah, exactly. It could be. I was watching...
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:24.320]   There's a new show with Ava Green on Apple TV called Liaison. And I knew...
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:28.560]   Wow. How is that? We're looking at that. I knew immediately some of the good...
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:32.240]   You should... Yeah. I love Ava Green. We've only seen the first episode. But you know immediately,
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:37.440]   it's not an Apple production because she's got an Android phone and there's a Windows laptop.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:41.760]   It's like, oh, they bought this one. Or she's bad. Or she's bad. She's a bad person.
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.320]   She's a bad person. It's clearly a Franco-British,
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:53.280]   joint production because it's half a French. It has a lot of potential. I found a lot of plot holes
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:04:00.160]   in the first episode. Like, come on, man, that's not what. But if you can ignore plot holes,
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:06.720]   they've got a great cast. Yeah. Yeah. I have to keep watching and letting you know.
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:11.200]   Let's do our picks of the week because it's time to wrap this episode up. Mark Armand,
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:19.280]   so thrilled to have you on. I'm a big fan. Many of our users use overcast to listen to our shows,
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:24.320]   our listeners. We appreciate it. You do a great job. And we often recommend it.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:29.680]   Thanks so much. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have anything you would like to pick of any kind book,
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:37.680]   movie, software? Not really. I've been... I think what I would just say is, you know, look,
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:42.320]   you're all listening to a podcast. Go out and find something new that you haven't heard before.
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:47.840]   There is still so much being produced in this open world of podcast and that we are all,
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:54.640]   you know, in and trying to preserve and expand and keep healthy. There is so much here and everyone,
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:59.120]   you know, if there's some show that goes behind Spotify or whatever and you don't want to follow
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:04.480]   it, you don't have to. There is so much here. So go out and try a podcast you never heard an
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:09.200]   episode of before. Just go try a new one. It can be easy to get stuck in the road of what you
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:13.120]   already know, what you already subscribed to and just never add new ones. Go add a new one.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:20.320]   I like that. Absolutely. Support that 100%. And make it not be a true crime or celebrity-driven
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:26.240]   podcast. Just my suggestion. If you like true crime, okay, go ahead. Marco, real pleasure.
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:32.000]   Overcast.fm. Marco's personal site is Marco.org. Is that right? I think it is.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.360]   That's right. I even updated maybe over two years. But you can see all the things he does,
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:43.520]   all the other podcasts, like the accidental tech podcast that he's involved in.
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:49.840]   It's really great. Yeah. It's been a year since you did the overcast redesign. So
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:55.120]   God, that must be like, you don't want to do that, right? A redesign?
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:58.800]   With a redesign? Yeah. That must just be put a pain in the butt.
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:04.720]   That was so much. And the problem is that whole redesign, I did it all in Objective-C and you like
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:10.480]   it. And part of the reason I want to move the whole app over to SwiftUI is that I know I could
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:15.840]   have done it way faster and I can change it way faster. So it's going to be a long time
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:20.560]   before this is done. But I will get to a better place eventually.
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:25.680]   But if you're a fan of San Francisco-rounded, you're going to be a fan of overcast. It's free
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:31.120]   in the app store. Go get it. Thank you, Marco. Really appreciate you taking the time to be with us.
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:37.280]   Thank you. Now get back to work. Andy and I go, let's get a pick of the week out of you, sir.
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:44.480]   This is a really fun virtual game platform that I came across a few weeks ago. It's called
[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:48.800]   Pico 8. And it is, you might have heard of, I'm sure you've heard of emulators that
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:52.960]   will emulate an old Game Boy, eliminate an old Nintendo. So this developer decided to,
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:58.400]   what if we were to emulate a game platform that never existed? So what if we design a virtual
[02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:05.120]   game platform that is specifically so that you can design these little retro style games,
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:10.320]   but they don't have to be retro under limitations that will create an aesthetic that will basically
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:15.520]   be across every single development. So it's every, the display quoted quote, it's 128 pixels,
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:23.680]   square 16 colors. Oh, wow. The four channel sound of 256 sprites, they definitely look like they're
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:29.920]   of a time, but you don't have to be like an old retro person. I don't, I don't like, I love my,
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:37.120]   I love my, my play date, because my, my style of gaming is that I don't want to spend hours
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:41.920]   and weeks and months figuring out how to play a game. I just want to relax for an hour on a little
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:47.680]   puzzle or a little piece of interactive art. And so this is what the limitations of Pico 8 create.
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:54.640]   And every, and the development system is interesting. So they have, they have virtual carts, cartridges
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:08:02.800]   that are actual PNG files. They're just PNG files with all the 32K code. These are animated PNGs.
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:07.920]   No, they're not there. It's a, it's a scripting language you script in Lua, but everything,
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:11.760]   you know, everything that all the assets for the game, all the code for the game is in this PNG
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:16.800]   file. You can also do it with a, with a text file. But the entire dev system is actually within
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:22.800]   this platform. So the background editor, sprite editor, music editor, they're all inside here.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:27.360]   You can also use your own external text editor to do that. But the idea is that to, again, give
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:32.320]   people creative limitations that they can work, not that they have to break through, but that they
[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:38.880]   can work inside to create again, these charming little games that are actually surprisingly
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:44.720]   sophisticated. And so you, you run these by buying a 50, they can either be run inside a web browser,
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:50.400]   so you can go to the Pico eight site and just play these games. Or you can, if you want to develop
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:54.160]   or take a look at the code that people have written for these other games, 15 bucks will,
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:58.480]   will give you an app on the, on the, on the Mac that gives you everything. It's also available
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:02.560]   for Windows also available for Linux. You can also run it on Raspberry Pi, there are a couple
[02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:06.720]   of handheld platform, actual physical handheld platforms that will also run these things. But
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:13.280]   primarily it's designed to be again an emulator for a game system that never existed. It is so
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:19.200]   charming and so much fun for the kind of gaming that I like, which is again, I want to, I want
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:25.760]   to play a maze game or, or, or, or, or an RPG or a simple like arcade game. And just like, while
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:31.200]   they've got 15 minutes, I'm waiting for something to have to waiting for a zoom call or something.
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:36.720]   I just want to relax and decompress. It doesn't involve again 60 bucks investment, and then like
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:43.040]   three months in which you are so emotionally tied up in this game that you only until you see this
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:47.680]   feel sunlight on your face and you realize that, Oh, I just blew, I just wasted an entire night's
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:52.240]   sleep because I was trying to figure out why this woman was walking through this swamp and saying
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:58.720]   such ghostly things. So you can play it for free again. I bought the $15 app because I wanted to
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:03.760]   support this. It's in beta, but it's very, very sophisticated right now. There are thousands and
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.240]   thousands of these games that people have uploaded, not not a good platform for making money off of
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:13.360]   because it really is designed to be show off what you made, share what you made and let other people
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:18.000]   see your code. It's quite cool. Boy. It really, it really. Where's the crank? So it needs a crank.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:23.600]   It needs a crank. You know, I mean, well, you know, it's once you go crank, you don't go bang.
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.680]   You're not going to go back. So do you find yourself playing this more or you're a little
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.880]   plaything play on there? I still, I still love my play date. It has the same sort of charm, the same
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:37.600]   sort of advantages that I think that Pico eight had. And one of the things that made me want to buy
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:44.160]   this that I had a feeling that this would attract a track like creative and slightly weird developers
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:50.160]   that would be attracted to this really odd form factor that really has so much that's familiar,
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:54.960]   so much that's unfamiliar. So there's so many really, really creative games on this. So I'm still
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:11:00.480]   buying games for this. I'm still playing it a lot, but it's nice. But it is 200, like it is 200 bucks.
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:05.600]   And also there, I don't think if you order now, there's like a two or three month wait with Pico
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:10.080]   eight, you can just go to a website and start playing these cool games without any investment,
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:15.680]   whatsoever. Definitely worth looking at. They have a sister simulation called Vauxotron,
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:21.280]   which is all Vauxhall based. Yeah, that was the developer of Vauxotron,
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:27.760]   basically develop Pico eight off of that project where he was, Vauxotron is still a very real thing,
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:32.000]   but he had this idea of G, what if we simplify this and G, what if there were like a game development
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.680]   system that had limitations? And like I said, I'm really, really pleased with this. I was, I was,
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:44.160]   I'm not so not so much that I'm maybe going to be buying like a handheld so I can do this while I'm
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:49.280]   play these games while I'm waiting for a subway or something. But I'm, this is the sort of creativity
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:55.200]   that you really, really want to reward. It is a creative app that allows other people to be creative
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:01.360]   and basically fly their own freak flags inside the game space. So I'm really thrilled with it.
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:06.960]   They also have an education edition and the offer site wide licenses for schools and public libraries
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:12.640]   and other educational spaces, which is really cool. Honestly, the game, it's not the graphics,
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:18.640]   it's the game and you could make, I'm sure a brilliant game. Exactly. It's an aesthetic. I don't,
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:25.760]   I don't like, I don't like, I don't like a retroness. I don't like nostalgia because it's all smacks
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:30.800]   of, Oh, remember, remember how awesome it was to be a teenager and to be in the 80s and about.
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:37.200]   That's nothing. This is, this is a very much a 2022, 2023 thing. But with the idea of,
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:43.280]   let's have a game platform with no micro transactions with, it's very easy, a very cheap buy in,
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:47.840]   it's very easy to play these games. It's very easy to develop or learn how these games were made.
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:51.680]   Again, I just four stars all across the board for me on this.
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:57.280]   Good recommendation. Thank you, Andy. Mr. Alex Lindsey, what did you guys say for the record?
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:01.040]   I didn't know that what Andy was going to refer to when I put mine in.
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:02.720]   So, so, so. So, so.
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:07.680]   So, this is similar. You guys, well, it's not the same. It's, it's, it actually, they think they
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:13.680]   will go together, which is, so my recommendation is scenario, gg scenario.gg. This is a,
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:19.920]   AI, it's a generator of art that's designed for game assets. So you could probably use it
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:23.760]   to generate assets that you could put into what Andy's talking about.
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:28.000]   So basically, this is kind of the beginning of kind of the, if you look at what they're doing
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.480]   here and I'm just getting started with it. So, but this is kind of the grown up, like,
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:38.240]   this is where AI goes as it starts to pick up speed, which is that you can give it, you can
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.720]   train it, you can give it guidance. There are many generators. There are things that you can
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.680]   work on there and they're in a, and it's really interesting. You can start, you can upload a bunch
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:50.960]   of images and say, I want you to look at this and I want you to build these assets. It's going to
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:56.000]   build a whole bunch of assets. It's not like, I mean, I love mid-journey, as you know, but, but I,
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:01.440]   but the, the thing is, is that I, with mid-journey, you can't really guide it very much. You kind of
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:06.640]   like throw in the, the prompts and hope, you know, because you don't control the data set, but this
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:11.360]   case, you, this one lets you start to put, have control over that and start to guide it and start
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:16.720]   to get, and get the assets that you need for an actual game. They just, they literally just raised
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:22.640]   a bunch of money. So this is going to go, this is going to go, probably go big, but it's, but,
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:27.680]   we, I think, artists must be, for months, trembling, boots. This is bad news for
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:33.840]   designers who are graphic artists, right? Maybe. I mean, I think that a lot of times people will take,
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:38.560]   take this stuff and get, you know, what we found, the people who are the most,
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:42.720]   the benefit the most, the people who understand what, with all this genitive art,
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:47.040]   understand what they're trying to get, understand, figure, quickly figure out how this makes their
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:51.280]   job faster and easier and starts to take advantage of it, rather than folks that are resisting will
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:56.640]   probably, you know, not, not do as well. It's too bad if he's collapsed, because this would be a great
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:02.000]   way to make the next generation of bored apes. Yeah. No, well, I mean, we thought, we, we thought
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.800]   about it. We started playing with it. That's how I got into mid-journey. I was like, I'm going to
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:09.600]   build a bunch of NFTs, you know, like, you know, like, you know, just put like fun things that we're
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:14.320]   going to, I was waiting for the gas fees to go down so that I could make them like nothing. Like,
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:20.640]   I didn't want to spend, you know, $100 per unit is not, not practical. So anyway, the,
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:25.920]   anyway, so I think that this is going to be, but this is the one of the few ones that you see that
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:31.760]   I would call growth, you know, mid-journey is kind of like teenage AI, but this is really grown up
[02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:35.200]   AI. This is like, I got to do something with it. I'm trying to generate things. I need more control
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:40.720]   than just putting in a prompt. And, and it just gives you a sense of where things are going.
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.800]   So I think that even if you're not necessarily interested in it, it's worth going to the website,
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:49.280]   build an account, play with it a little bit, but understand like this is, this is a much bigger
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:54.080]   step towards how AI, Genent of Art is going to, is going to move. Well, absolutely.
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:16:02.160]   Clear that the, what you're seeing now in AI is not the end game. It's just, it's not even close.
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:06.960]   I mean, this is, I mean, people are going to do much more interesting things than just have a chat
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:13.360]   bot. Well, it's democratizing creativity. And what I mean by that is that a lot of us, you know,
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:18.400]   have to, you know, a director for a film doesn't run the cameras, doesn't run the lights, doesn't
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:23.360]   move the, move the C stands around. They have an vision, they have a vision and they have millions
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:27.680]   of dollars to hire people to do those, those visions. And what we're moving to are very quickly
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:33.600]   is people having a vision and being able to have, and be able to create some of those visions without,
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:38.320]   without, without, you know, and again, if you're very, very talented, this is not, I don't think
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:43.200]   this is really going to affect you anytime soon, probably in most people's lifetimes or careers at
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:48.720]   least. But if you are mediocre to getting started, this is going to be really difficult, you know,
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:55.120]   for folks to kind of figure that out. And so, but, but again, it's, it is a, it's going to be an
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:17:00.320]   explosion of creativity, I think. And I think that, you know, because we had, I mean, this stuff has
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:03.760]   been around for a long time. I worked, I went to a research facility in the late 90s where they
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:07.760]   gave me a sphere and you just went like this, and a sphere appeared and we were in VR and you could
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:13.040]   pull the thing around and everything else. And that room costs $20 million. So, so much, but the,
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:17.680]   but this kind of stuff, that's what we're going to get to is someone can walk in and there's rumors
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.680]   that Apple's working on this, you can walk in and say, I want this, I want this, give me a tree,
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:24.880]   give me a this, you know, and it starts putting the things in, you start moving them around.
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:30.960]   And that's going to really change the way people, the average person who has ideas,
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:35.760]   but doesn't have the skills can actually, you know, execute the on those ideas.
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:41.520]   And I think that's going to be a really interesting, you know, it, it, and when people say, well,
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:45.600]   anybody can, if everybody can do it, then it'll be nothing, but well, everybody can have a pencil
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:48.800]   and paper, it doesn't mean anything. So what happened to podcasts, everybody could do it.
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:54.000]   Yeah, but doesn't, you know, but most of them are again, it falls away pretty, there's not that
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.440]   many pond. I mean, there's, yeah, no, that's thousands of other good, but there's not the
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:02.080]   quality is a huge number of people who have the ability and the skills, but don't have
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:08.160]   whatever the technical expertise or a $20 million room to do stuff. I think you're right. I think
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:13.760]   it's a lever. Yeah, it's fascinating. Anyway, this is a really
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:19.520]   dot GG. What's it called? This is so much more. I'm, I have a free version.
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:23.120]   They didn't give it to me. I'm just saying I downloaded it. I got it in no one's
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:27.440]   actually price anywhere. Yeah. No one's asking for money yet. I'm just experimenting with it and
[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:30.400]   playing with it and building little assets that I don't know what I'd use for, but I
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:34.400]   I'm playing with it, uploading images and putting things in so I don't, I have no one's
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:40.320]   going to start playing with AI because everybody is trying to figure out what to do to monetize
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:47.200]   and using your inputs to help tune their products. So why not take advantage of this right now?
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:52.000]   Well, and again, it's charging for it. Yeah. It's much easier to understand it when it's
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.160]   moving slowly. You know, like it's when it's when it's not when things are still early and they're
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:01.040]   not and they're still in their very early state, it's much easier to understand it. It's much
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:04.480]   easier to play with it. It's much easier so that you can start to see what those trajectories are
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:08.880]   going to look like. And so when I jump on, I mean, my business is mostly jumping on something
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:12.960]   that no one's ever done before and figuring out if I turn it into something. But so I'm
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:16.720]   constantly, anything new, I'm always like, okay, let's take a look at this and figure out how to
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:20.960]   assimilate it. And then I make decisions like I jumped on Clubhouse for like two weeks and I was
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:26.960]   like, this is going to be a disaster. And I left. So anyway, so, so the, but so I jump on a lot of
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:30.800]   these things. And but I think this one's really interesting. I think that they're, you know,
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:34.880]   the founders are really, I mean, again, I've been tracking them on Twitter, you know, like,
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:41.200]   watching what they're posting and, and really paying attention to like where they're going.
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:44.240]   And it's a really interesting approach to it. So it's going to be interesting.
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:46.400]   Scenario.gg.
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:54.800]   Thank you, everybody. Marco Arment, Marco.org overcast.fm, the accidental tech podcast.
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:20:01.280]   He's Marco Arment on Mastodon. Social. Really appreciate your taking time here.
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:03.280]   Thank you so much. It's been fun.
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:06.480]   It's been real fun. Andy and I, there's 700 episodes,
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:14.640]   700 episodes for now. Expect a call on my transceiver, super duper heterodyne, space radio.
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:20.640]   Andy and I co when are you going to be on GBH next? I'm off this week, but I'm on next Thursday at
[02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:25.360]   1230, go to wgph news.org to stream it, listen to it live or later. Nice.
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:30.720]   Thank you, Andy. And Alex Lindsey, of course, office hours. Global is a great way
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:38.800]   to, you could see, and Alex is a font of creativity to tap into that. The mid journey was a show today.
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:43.120]   If you, you did a little segment for us on mid journey, but this is the full blown.
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:47.120]   It's an hour of us talking. It's not just me. It's like an hour of us talking about mid journey. So,
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:51.360]   so like, you know, talking about what's working, what's not working. And, and, you know, some
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:56.640]   guides, it's a little bit more expands, expands from that. And we had a great session yesterday
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:21:01.120]   about the market, you know, your brand and how to build your brand and, and so on, so forth. And,
[02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:02.800]   and so it's been, it's really good.
[02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:04.960]   So it'll acoustics tomorrow. Yes.
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:09.920]   Office video shoots on Thursday. The variety of stuff that you cover.
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:14.320]   What is a pedagogy wheel? You mean pedagogy? What's a pedagogy?
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:16.720]   It might be a misspelling. We'll take a look at it.
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:19.600]   But should we pedagogy? It's really interesting.
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:22.560]   You have a lot of educators on education. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:25.040]   Yeah. So we have a lot of, a lot of discussions about them. Yeah.
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.680]   Fantastic stuff. Office hours.global.
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:32.400]   Free to all. You can watch on YouTube, but you can also join in. It's a zoom call every morning.
[02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:35.200]   Thank you all on YouTube. Yeah.
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:37.280]   On YouTube. Yeah. The easiest way to watch it.
[02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:40.720]   Just watch the YouTube. Yeah. Thank you all. But if you want to ask questions,
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:42.480]   join the zoom. It's all in. It's all there at all.
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:45.520]   Well, here's the worst part is I figured out how to make it another hour long.
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:49.360]   You know, so, so we, we were like, we look at all these questions and I'm like,
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:52.400]   why don't we sit around and talk about the questions before the show starts.
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:54.800]   And now people are, everyone's showing up early and there's a whole thing.
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:56.640]   I was like, this is now going to be a four hour show.
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:00.080]   Oh, yeah. Like today's is two hours and 12 minutes.
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:04.320]   Well, they're all two hours. But the thing is, there's an hour that happens before the two hours
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:09.920]   of us like doing mic checks, uh, talking and everything else. But now we started turning into
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:13.360]   work because now we look at all the questions and we're like, so you're going to have to do
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:16.640]   an hour before the hour getting ready for the hour that's getting ready.
[02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:19.440]   That's, that's exactly how I'm just all going to turn out.
[02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:22.640]   As soon as I did it, I was like, Oh, this is too much fun. We had so much fun talking about the
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:24.080]   questions. I was like, I just have to get up early.
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:26.720]   And this is probably, I don't need to sleep. This is a problem.
[02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:27.440]   He can't stop.
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:28.880]   It's not.
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:33.360]   Thank you all for joining us. We do Mac break weekly, uh, Tuesdays, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m.
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:39.600]   Eastern time. That's a 1900 UTC. If you want to watch us live at live.twitt.tv.
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:44.720]   If you're watching live chat live at our IRC open to all IRC.twitt.tv.
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:47.440]   If you're a club, Twitter member, you can chat in our discord.
[02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:50.320]   Always a lot of fun there club, two, it's seven bucks a month.
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:52.320]   Ad free versions of all of our shows.
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:56.240]   You also get the discord, which is turned out to be as far as I'm concerned,
[02:22:56.240 --> 02:23:00.160]   the best darn community out there. Really great hang.
[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:05.600]   And not just for the shows. I mean, it's every topic geeks are interested in.
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:09.280]   And then of course, the twit plus feed with additional shows like Michael Sargent's
[02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:13.920]   hands on Mac and Tasha Paul Therat's hands on windows, the untitled Linux show,
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:18.480]   the Giz phase and all of that. Uh, tWitt.tv slash club,
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:20.560]   Twitter, seven bucks a month. I think it's a great deal.
[02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:23.840]   And we sure appreciate it helps us keep the lights on.
[02:23:23.840 --> 02:23:27.760]   And increasingly that's getting harder and harder to do.
[02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:33.520]   Uh, if you want to watch the show after the fact, there's audio and video at
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:38.880]   twitt.tv slash mbw. There's a YouTube channel dedicated to Mac break weekly.
[02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:41.200]   And of course, it's easiest to subscribe and overcast that way.
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:46.880]   You'll get it automatically. Just just download overcast and subscribe to Mac break weekly.
[02:23:46.880 --> 02:23:50.320]   And you'll get it every week the minute it's available.
[02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:54.960]   Thanks for joining us everybody. Now it's my sad duty to say, get back to work.
[02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:57.280]   This break time is over. Bye bye.
[02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:02.400]   Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor and chief vat astromagazine. And each week I joined with my
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:06.960]   co-host to bring you this week in space, the latest and greatest news in the final frontier.
[02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:10.800]   We talked to NASA chief space scientists, engineers, educators, and artists and
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:15.520]   sometimes we just shoot the breeze over what's hot and what's not in space books and TV.
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:19.440]   And we do it all for you, our fellow true believers. So whether you're an armchair
[02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:23.200]   adventurer or waiting for your turn to grab a slot in Elon's Mars rocket,
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:32.400]   join us on this week in space and be part of the greatest adventure of all time.
[02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:37.920]   [Music]
