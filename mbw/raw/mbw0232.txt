[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.400]   Hi, everyone.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.200]   Welcome back to Macbreak.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.920]   This is Alex Hittman for Leo, who is by this time on his way.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720]   He's on a plane.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.320]   I don't think he's on the ship yet.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.200]   But he is getting very close to being
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.560]   on his big cruise.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.520]   I'm so jealous he's going down there.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.280]   Of course, the only thing is I have to say is that I saw
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.200]   one of the big cruise liners on DryDoc down by Revision 3.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.440]   I was on my way to Revision 3 yesterday.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.800]   And then I saw on DryDoc.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.000]   I was like, I don't know.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.600]   Hopefully we get Leo back.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.520]   I mean, if it gets stalled down in South America,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.400]   we might-- it could be a long time.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.440]   I don't want to worry, worry anybody here at the Twin
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.760]   Studios, but it's kind of scary.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.440]   Anyway, we have a great cast here.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.280]   From Indianapolis, Justin Williams from Second Gear.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   Hey, Justin.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.640]   Hello.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.880]   How are you doing there?
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.960]   Just want to say that if my internet connection
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.440]   drops at any time, assume the ice has won.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.880]   How is it there?
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.640]   I went outside thinking that I would pick up lunch today.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.480]   And there is just a giant sheet of ice.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.760]   There is nothing-- anyone that is out today is insane,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.840]   because there's more ice coming down as I'm looking out
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.240]   the window.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.560]   It's crazy.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.360]   Please, never come here.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.760]   Well, it makes you-- it makes you feel any better.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.360]   It's really sunny and nice here in Petaluma.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.600]   Yeah, you keep wearing that short sleeve shirt there,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.200]   Mr. Lindsey.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.360]   Yeah, you can see it right here.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.200]   And I was a little warm on the way here.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.760]   Sorry.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.000]   So also, coming in from all--
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.400]   we don't know what the weather's like in Atlanta.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.840]   Aaron Hillagas from Big Nerd Ranch.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.800]   Hey, Aaron.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.320]   It's a little cool and rainy today,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.800]   but it's a lot more pleasant than a lot of places.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.880]   Rainy for it, cool and rainy for Atlanta, which--
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.400]   What's up with it?
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.960]   --what temperature does cool in Atlanta?
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.480]   It's probably 60 degrees here.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.200]   So there you go.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.040]   Yeah, rub it in.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.120]   So we've got a lot of great news for today.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.080]   So we're really cranking through here.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.320]   We'll jump right into it.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.360]   Sony-- OK, here's some big news.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.600]   And it has some possible--
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.040]   possibly some very big implications.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.600]   The Sony Reader app has now been--
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.520]   has been rejected.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.080]   And basically, Apple's saying you can't do in-app purchases
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.040]   without going through the system that they've created.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.000]   Of course, none of us really are using the Sony Reader.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.880]   Not very many of us are using the Sony Reader right now.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880]   And that's not a big deal.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.200]   But the thing that this, of course, brings up immediately
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.160]   is how does this affect the Kindle?
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.800]   Aaron, is this something that we might see across the system?
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.200]   And could this actually affect what Amazon's doing?
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.040]   Well, I think it's a real big concern.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.720]   I mean, naturally, Apple is trying
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.000]   to leverage what they have in the iTunes Store and iBooks
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.080]   to really dominate the whole area.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.800]   And this is a way they could really damage the Kindle
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.440]   experience.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.280]   I mean, when you're thinking about buying a book
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.840]   and you think, well, I could buy it on iBooks,
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.000]   then it will only be available on my Apple platforms
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.840]   or I could buy it on the Kindle.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.880]   Then it would be available everywhere.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.640]   It's a very compelling story.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.720]   And it does not play well with Apple's narrative.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.520]   Justin, does this worry you as an app developer?
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.720]   Yeah, as an app developer, it does worry me.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.120]   But has Apple actually come out and said
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.560]   what their intentions are with this?
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.720]   Because it seems like this would be something
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.360]   that would really frustrate both consumers.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.360]   Me, definitely because I'm a Kindle user,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.120]   but also publishers because they're kind of saying,
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.880]   all right, if you want to have any sort of book content
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.200]   or magazine content or any digital content
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.160]   on an iPhone or an iPad, you've got to go through us.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.480]   And then you say this to all the people who have a nook
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.160]   or have a Kindle and you say, all right,
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.360]   you guys want to use that stuff on your iPad now?
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.120]   Well, you need to re-buy those books to the iPad.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.480]   What does Apple say?
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.440]   Well, it basically, one of the things
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.600]   that looks like in TechCrunch,
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   it looks like has some more of the details.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.360]   But it looks like Apple saying it's not for everything.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's not going to change the way the Kindle set up.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.840]   It's not changing anything that anybody else
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.600]   has had put together.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.280]   But it's specifically the way Sony
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.400]   is actually putting this together
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.440]   is the problem that they're having.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.920]   So anyway, we'll see how this pans out.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.320]   But of course, this is something that everyone worries about
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.920]   when they think about Apple
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.640]   and they think of the Mac App Store.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.360]   This is in the closed system that Apple's creating.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.280]   Is it Apple really is the, they're the owner of all of this.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.960]   There's not a lot of, they can do, currently,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.680]   they can pretty much do whatever they want to do.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.280]   It doesn't look like, I think we can all agree
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.520]   that Apple probably couldn't go down the path
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.600]   of turning Kindle off.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.520]   It seems like that would be pretty painful.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.680]   Even people like me who are pretty strong Apple supporters
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.160]   would be pretty upset because I still buy most
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.000]   of my books on the Kindle
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.640]   because I don't, most of the books that I want to buy
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.920]   are not on the iBook store.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.440]   So the, go ahead, go ahead, Justin.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.320]   - Well, what I'm thinking is that they haven't released,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.520]   they're not saying what it is,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.720]   but my theory right now is that they're basically saying
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   that if you want to be able to do purchase it
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.320]   or to use content that you buy outside of the app store,
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   you have to be able to offer it as an in-app purchase in store.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.400]   And so my interpretation of that would be that
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.880]   if you want to buy a Kindle book on Amazon site,
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.400]   you also have to be able to buy it through the Kindle
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.360]   or through in-app purchases on your iPhone,
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.040]   which then would give Apple the 30% cut.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.560]   So what will happen?
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.400]   Maybe we'll see when the next version of the Kindle app
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.480]   that comes out, it's not going to have the buy books
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.680]   button up in the upper left corner
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.600]   or wherever that button is.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.000]   They'll just take that button out and say,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.960]   if you want to get books, you just have to assume
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.120]   that you're going to go to Amazon site
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.640]   or to the Barnes and Noble site.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.880]   And this could have something to do with the daily.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.640]   - And this is according to Apple spokesman
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.040]   has given this statement specifically,
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.120]   this is on TechCrunch.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.840]   We have not changed our developer terms or guidelines.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.200]   We are now requiring that if an app offers customers
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.960]   the ability to purchase books outside of the app,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.760]   that the same option is also available to customers
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.960]   from within the app within app purchase.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.600]   So that's the, it is the, you have to do both,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.520]   it appears to stay within Apple's bounds.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.600]   I think that what they don't want to do
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.680]   is send people out right now, I guess there's no way
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.520]   to do this with Kindle, I don't think.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.440]   I don't know if you can buy it.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.880]   Can you buy books?
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.240]   I've never tried to buy a book in the Kindle.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.120]   - What it does is it launches a web view.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.040]   So you click a button and it say,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.200]   it launches Mobile Safari, you go to the Amazon mobile site,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.640]   you buy the book and you say, send it to my iPads
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.320]   and to my Kindle, send it to whatever device you want to use.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.440]   And then when you relaunch the app, it downloads it.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.560]   So there's no in-app purchase in essence.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.880]   It's basically doing what any other,
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.080]   what they've been doing for three years,
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.200]   it's basically just pushing you off to a mobile web browser.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.360]   - So the question is, is Apple gonna continue to allow this?
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.240]   And if Apple doesn't, if Apple says,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.960]   yeah, you can keep the Kindle on here,
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.080]   but you're gonna have to start going,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.240]   making in-app purchase available,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.880]   is Amazon going to say, you know what,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.720]   we're gonna pull out?
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.840]   - Right, that's how you have to,
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.920]   you're kind of having trouble parsing the semantics
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.320]   of what Apple statement is there.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.240]   Are they saying, if you're gonna have any sort
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.840]   of digital content, even if you were to buy it
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.240]   on your Mac or your PC at home,
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.800]   you have to offer it for sale in the app via in-app purchase,
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.520]   or are they saying that if you're gonna sell stuff
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.160]   by opening Mobile Safari on the phone,
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.540]   you have to offer an app.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.980]   The first one, that's probably not a good thing.
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.680]   The second one, I can tolerate,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.000]   although it is a frustrating thing,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.520]   both as a developer and an iPhone user,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.920]   because I use Kindle far more often
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   than I use the iBooks app.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.040]   - Now, Aaron, do you think that Amazon will go by?
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.400]   And if Amazon pulled it,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.960]   do you think that the PR becomes an issue for Amazon?
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.240]   As opposed to Apple, Apple just saying,
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.520]   well, these are the rules and you have to add this to it,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.200]   and then that leaves it to Amazon
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.060]   to pull the app out of the system.
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.440]   Oh, we lost his audio.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.120]   Oh, hold on a second.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.520]   We lost your audio, Aaron.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.200]   You can hear us, I can't hear you.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.040]   - Can you hear me now?
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.960]   - Yes.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.800]   - Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.040]   Yes, so we just recently wrote an e-book reader
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.680]   for a client who sells books,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.320]   and I know that they would be very reluctant
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.840]   to make that option available,
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.760]   because Apple would take their 30% from the in-app sales.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.600]   So I would think that Amazon would be in a similar situation.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.160]   They've discounted it,
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.440]   I don't think they're gonna feel comfortable
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.680]   with selling books at the same price
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.880]   through the Apple Store.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.200]   - So we'll see how this pans out.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.600]   We're gonna keep track of this.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.920]   Hopefully we'll know one way or the other
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.400]   from Amazon in the next couple of weeks.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.000]   One of the things that we talked a lot about
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.560]   at Macworld, and we'll talk a little bit more
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.280]   about Macworld as we move forward,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.280]   is really the Mac App Store in the future of iOS and OS X.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.200]   And one of the things I think we have the advantage of today
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   is that we've got some developers that are here online
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   and it'd be very interesting to hear
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.640]   what you guys think about the first month,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.640]   month and a half of the Mac App Store
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.960]   and what you think it may hint to in the future.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.160]   Aaron, what do you think as far as what you've seen to date
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.000]   with the Mac App Store?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.240]   How do you think it's performing?
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.880]   - Oh, I think it's going great.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.280]   I think developers are seeing revenues
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.800]   they never would have seen otherwise.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.440]   I think Justin's probably the right person
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.320]   to answer the question, but everyone seems really excited.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.440]   The app itself is a little awkward.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.280]   I find searching things not great,
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.200]   but I think that'll evolve over time.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.520]   Justin, what do you think?
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.920]   - I really, really like the Mac App Store,
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.360]   both as a consumer and as a developer.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.920]   So if you approach it from the developer standpoint,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.840]   it's really great because my main Mac application
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.240]   is called today and it's basically a daily calendar
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.000]   that you can use in conjunction with iCal.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.360]   And it's an app that a lot of people
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.080]   are really a big fan of that use it,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.200]   but it's not actually something
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.480]   that you would ever search for,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.520]   like you would say cooking software
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.560]   or software to manage your book catalogs.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.400]   And the Mac App Store is giving apps
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.960]   that have this really unique and useful utility,
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.600]   productivity apps like that,
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.400]   that you might not necessarily search for.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.440]   It's giving users a really great way
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.880]   to just casually browse and find these gyms out there,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.920]   these things that you would put as a pick of the week
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.760]   on Mac break or you would write about
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.120]   as a Mac gym on Mac world.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.360]   It's making it a lot easier to find those
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.920]   and get more people to use the app.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.360]   So I'm really a fan of it because it makes my apps
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.400]   a lot more accessible to users.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.600]   And then just whenever I want to buy stuff now,
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.160]   I've started to become the lazy snob
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.600]   who doesn't want to buy software
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.080]   outside of the Mac App Store.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.440]   You know, it's one of the things.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.960]   It's one of the things we were talking about.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.640]   We were talking about this at Mac world.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.280]   I found myself very, very quickly moving to,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.360]   for small applications,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.240]   large applications, I can understand not having them
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.400]   on the App Store, I can understand going through
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.800]   an install process, but for anything less than $100
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.120]   or even $200, I find myself now just going,
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.640]   "Why isn't this on the Mac App Store?"
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.320]   I mean, why do I have to go through all this process
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.760]   to download it and install it?
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.160]   It seems that very quickly,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.520]   this is what, of course, everyone's worried about,
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.200]   is that it's going to become the de facto way,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.040]   especially if you're doing a small application
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.200]   or a smaller application,
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.000]   that this is the way people are gonna want to buy it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.360]   Now, the question is, is that,
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.200]   Aaron, do you think that this drives developers
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.080]   towards building more small applications
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.680]   and less large complex ones?
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.840]   I think it really does.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.600]   I mean, when we're seeing the pricing power
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.240]   and the idea of apps are going to be expected
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.600]   to be at a lower price point,
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.320]   I think people are gonna be forced
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.480]   to do quicker release cycles,
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.440]   add a few features, get what you can out of it
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.520]   and move forward.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.160]   I think that overall, the iPhone App Store
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.680]   has changed expectations of the users
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.520]   that they're starting to think.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.800]   They should be able to buy a program for $1.99
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.000]   and I'll be interested to see
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.200]   if we can adjust those expectations over time.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.760]   Well, yeah, and I know that for me,
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.760]   I have gotten to this situation where,
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.840]   like when I see an iApp that does more than one thing.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.640]   It's actually, it's got a whole bunch of things.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.480]   It's swissarming up, I'm like,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.360]   whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.320]   that's not what I want to buy for my iPhone.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.120]   You know, that's not what I want to buy.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.600]   I want to buy something that does one thing.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.520]   You know, and if it does,
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.800]   if they start adding more features,
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.040]   I immediately start to, you know,
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.760]   not sure if they're all going to really work
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.880]   or I definitely don't want to pay for them.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.480]   I kind of want to buy each piece.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.600]   Justin, does this affect how you, you know,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.960]   approach development?
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.240]   Yeah, it does,
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.280]   but I don't think it's going to affect pricing
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.400]   the way that it has affected it on the iOS App Store.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.600]   What I think is going to happen is
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.320]   that you're going to see a different class of applications.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.360]   So you're still going to have the large applications
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.920]   like the RapidWeavers or the Photoshop's or the,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.240]   well, I'm trying to look at my doc here, the iChats,
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.880]   the larger applications that have a general utility
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   and those are still going to be your $35,
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.520]   your $40 Mac applications,
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.040]   but you're going to see a lot of smaller utility apps
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.480]   that are kind of like the one trick ponies
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.640]   that you get on the iPhone.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.080]   And I think those are going to be
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.360]   around the five or $10 range.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.840]   In my case with today, what I did is I'm still going to maintain
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.160]   having both of my stores.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.240]   So I have the store that I'm using on my website
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.680]   and then I'll be in the Mac App Store.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.960]   But for the launch, I decided to experiment
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.080]   with the pricing a little bit.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.440]   And by default, today retails for $25,
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.000]   which is what I was been charging basically
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.920]   because it doesn't sell as many copies
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.840]   because not as many people are looking for it.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.760]   But I was like, well, we've got this captive audience
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.800]   with the Mac App Store now.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.640]   So let's put it out there at 10 bucks
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.920]   and people can still go to my website, they can try it.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.120]   And if they like it, 10 bucks.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.760]   The sales have been higher than they were
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.920]   in the past 11 months.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.360]   It hasn't been this high since it,
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.120]   I launched today too back in January of 2010.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.800]   And I think part of that is because it's finding an audience
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.920]   and part of that is because now it's priced
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.000]   at a point where people think it's still a great utility,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.440]   but it's still not $1.99.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.800]   $10 is still not something that you have to think about.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.360]   And I think you're going to see a lot of other applications
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.280]   play with that as well.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.080]   The real Mac software guys have done that as well.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.480]   They have an application called Little Snapper,
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.240]   which is a really great utility
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.360]   if you're going to be archiving screenshots.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.680]   We use it all the time to kind of look for inspiration
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.240]   on whenever I find a screenshot of something in a new app,
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.360]   I take a screenshot of it.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.040]   But that's an app that's gone from, I think, $40 to $30 to $20.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.400]   And a couple of weeks ago, they just went ahead
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.720]   and did a $5 weekend pricing sale.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.600]   And they sold more copies than they had ever, I think.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.560]   - Well, and that, but doesn't that start creating a slippery slope?
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.840]   Before we get before we go any further,
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.520]   I want to introduce Andy and Aco,
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.160]   who we had a little trouble with connectivity,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.480]   but we now have him here.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.000]   And right now, Andy's a little stretched too,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.120]   but you can see him here.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.920]   We're going to drop him in Andy.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.200]   How is the weather in Boston?
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.560]   - It's white, Alex.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.640]   It's very, very white.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.400]   I made a notation in my diary
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.800]   that around 1031 this morning is the exact point
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   in the 2010, 2011 season in which I decided
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.480]   that Snow is no longer New England picturesque.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.800]   It's just a big pain in the butt.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.560]   (laughing)
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   - It is, yes.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.120]   So yes, judging behind me,
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.000]   you know what the weather is like right now.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.640]   It's actually started again this morning.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.960]   So when did you get back from Macworld?
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.040]   I got back early on Sunday,
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.160]   took the Red Eye overnight Saturday.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.880]   So I just got into one of those rare keyholes
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.280]   between blizzards.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.480]   Now, this is the conversation that I left you with, actually.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.680]   We were having this conversation at Macworld
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.200]   about the future of the Mac App Store,
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.240]   as well as the future of iOS and OS 10.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.880]   The question really is,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.880]   is the price going to a road overall?
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.600]   I mean, can you maintain a $300 application
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.840]   or a $400 application as this Mac App Store
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.200]   continues to expand, Andy?
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.000]   - I just think that the $300 and the $400 application
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.360]   has never needed the App Store to begin with.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.400]   So I don't think that they're gonna have to continue
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.160]   to justify their prices.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.040]   Photoshop always had to justify why someone
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.520]   would have to spend $600 on an app that lets you just
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.840]   remove wrinkles, creases, and restore ones to cheaply figure.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.760]   But for the, I think the real meat
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.600]   of the Mac App environment has always been the cheaper ones,
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.520]   the ones that were like 50 bucks and less.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.560]   I did, I have been doing sort of a casual sort of tour
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.040]   of what the prices are doing on the Mac App Store.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.040]   And I haven't seen a really big softening of prices yet.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.280]   What I haven't seen is like what I've been hearing
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.120]   for the past five minutes in which there are a lot
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.080]   of developers who are sort of experimenting with,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.560]   gee, my goodness, I had no idea.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.000]   I'd be selling so many copies of this piece of software
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.040]   over the past few weeks.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.160]   What would happen if I were to reduce prices just this weekend
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.520]   and let's see if I can,
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.680]   if I were to just cut the price down to five bucks from 20,
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.880]   just for three days, what would that happen?
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.760]   So I think that if there's a softening of prices,
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.960]   it's gonna be experimental in nature.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.040]   And it's gonna end right quick as soon as developers realize
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.960]   that they've started to price themselves out of the market.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.800]   - Yeah, what's your deal with it?
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.240]   - Go ahead.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.240]   - Alex, I have one more interesting data point,
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.680]   which is that we offer classes on
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.680]   Cocoa Desktop Programming and iOS Programming.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.040]   And I'm just seeing a lot more demand
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.520]   for the Cocoa Programming right now.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.320]   So three months ago, it was hard to sell.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.680]   Now it's easy to sell.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.800]   So there are new developers coming in to the environment
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.840]   just because of the Mac store, I believe.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.600]   - Well, just because of the Mac store for me,
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.160]   I know that we do mostly pro apps.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.640]   And one of the things that we're really looking at
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.040]   is taking the green screen technologies and so on and so forth
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.400]   that we make in DeFi Garage
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.200]   and finding ways to package them into $10 or $20 items
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.440]   because it's something that we think
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.040]   that there's a big market out there
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.280]   that we haven't really been accessing.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.560]   And it's interesting because it's been going
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.000]   the other direction for us most of the time.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.880]   We've been slowly increasing our prices
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.480]   because no one takes us seriously.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.720]   It's the same thing.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.160]   You know, we had a $99 application.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.880]   And when we made it $199, we sold twice as many.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.560]   You know, and it was just like this,
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.720]   I don't understand.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.040]   You know, so in our world, in the professional world,
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.920]   you have the issue where people look at it
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.120]   and it's kind of like the price of wine.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.280]   Well, that can't be a good price of wine.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.480]   That can't be good wine because it's $9.99.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.160]   I think you've sort of hit upon the difference
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.200]   between two different classes of apps.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.120]   There's a difference between the price you need to set
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.680]   when someone is spending their own money
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.600]   and the price you need to set
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.000]   when they're spending their clients' money.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.480]   So it's gonna be interesting.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.120]   We're gonna come right back and discuss this
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.320]   a little bit more and talk about how this new Mac App Store
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.200]   fits into the greater picture of iOS and OS X.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.240]   Before we do that, I wanna thank one of our sponsors,
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.640]   Gazelle, of course, I just, I'm piling up.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.200]   I got a box in my house.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.600]   That is, it's got a big sharpie thing on the side
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.760]   that just says, Gazelle.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.480]   You know, and it's just like,
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.080]   I'm no longer saying I'm throwing it away.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.280]   Like, I'm getting rid of that.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.480]   I'm saying, yeah, I'm gonna, I gotta Gazelle it.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.440]   You know, and it's no longer getting rid of it.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.480]   It's Gazelle in it.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.840]   And the, you know, if you have smartphones, MP3 players,
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.520]   e-book readers, laptops, cameras, all of those things,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.960]   you know, there are 200,000 items that you can get,
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.760]   that you can sell on Gazelle.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.000]   And it's really easy.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.840]   Here's how it works.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.400]   You go to Gazelle.com, and you can enter your Macan model
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.560]   of your gadget, and you can see how Gazelle is going to,
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.600]   you know, what it's gonna offer.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.160]   And, you know, and you have to go through there and say,
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.480]   well, it's in good pristine condition.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.800]   I have the box for it, which I never, I never have.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.000]   I don't really like boxes.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.320]   You know, do I have all the cables, which I,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.280]   I never have either.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.600]   So, you know, now, now that I'm going through it,
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.240]   the other thing I'm using Gazelle for, by the way,
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.920]   is a guide to what I have to do
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.040]   so that I can sell these items later.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.520]   Because I never thought about those things before.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.120]   I never try to keep track of them.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.560]   But you can go in and into marketplace,
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.440]   and you can see this little graph
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.480]   that's gonna tell you exactly, you know, where, you know,
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.760]   this is how bad it's gonna get
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.880]   if you hang on to that item.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.800]   So, you know, there's a little bit of pressure,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.560]   a little bit of pressure to kind of move along
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   and sell your item, get rid of it.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.440]   And, you know, a lot of times, you know, before Gazelle,
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.800]   I have to admit that I was just kind of,
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.920]   there was a box and it was just literally
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.080]   where electronics went, and then they would sit there
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.440]   for another six months or a year,
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.240]   and then I would finally just kind of
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.840]   try to figure out where to put them.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.320]   You know, and the other thing is,
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.040]   if your item isn't worth anything,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.240]   any more Gazelle will responsibly recycle it,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.520]   which is an important piece,
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.920]   'cause a lot of times we don't know where to put it,
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.800]   and just throwing it away is really, really bad karma,
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.760]   just in case you're wondering.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.000]   So, now, you can, here's the key,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.880]   go to Gazelle.com, use the offer code MACBRAKE,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.680]   and you're gonna get 5% more.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.160]   So, it's not just, you know, you can,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.240]   depending on what you're gonna get,
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.360]   whether your iPhone is, if it's $300,
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.240]   you're gonna get 315.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.800]   So, definitely check it out.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.840]   Gazelle.com, it is the best way
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.040]   to get rid of the stuff that you're not using anymore,
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.200]   all the electronic items that you're stacking up,
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.240]   and as MAC users who buy everything that Steve,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.840]   you know, tells us to buy,
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.800]   this is a great thing for us.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.360]   You know, you're able to avoid the landfill,
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.000]   avoid all those other things, and get it out there.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.160]   So, don't throw it away, don't sell it, Gazelle.com,
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.680]   and once again, use the MACBRAKE code to get 5% more.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.280]   So, now, we've got the, we have the, you know,
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   the MAC App Store, we've got the iOS Store,
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.600]   and one of the things that, you know,
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.480]   that Andy and I don't, don't necessarily see IDI on.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.720]   We've had this discussion a couple times that,
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.440]   is I think that, I think that OS 10,
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.600]   the OS 10 as we know it is over.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   I think it's gone.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.920]   I think that, you know, I mean, I think that,
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.680]   well, it's, it's dead, dead OS walking.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.240]   Well, let's put this in the right framework.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.160]   Most of the times these arguments go down to,
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.040]   is the MAC, is the desktop OS moving towards iOS,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.320]   which is a totally different question.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   I agree that the MAC OS 10 is dead,
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.480]   it's so, X-parrot, it's drawing the court,
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.200]   and run the right, well, on the way,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.440]   it's not dead, but it can see dead from here,
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.280]   it's on a, on a dead plan, a very good dead,
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.360]   go pilot live sort of course track,
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.160]   but that's just the natural way of things.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.600]   So, how long did we really have a MAC OS 9,
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.920]   MAC OS system 7, MAC OS 8, MAC OS 9,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.960]   before it got replaced and transitioned
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.040]   into something that was a lot bigger and a lot better,
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.320]   but I don't think that we're gonna see a sort of,
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.320]   we're not gonna see a sort of bastard child
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.720]   between iOS and MAC OS
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.040]   into the next edition of the desktop operating system.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.560]   I just think that Apple's gonna take,
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.760]   just like they said during the press event a few months ago,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.400]   I think that they're gonna listen and observe
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.240]   of what works well for iOS.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.880]   I think that they were just as surprised
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.080]   as a lot of observers when they realized
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.760]   that a lot of people were buying iPads with keyboards,
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.680]   with kick with, with easel stands
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.280]   because they're actually using them,
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.320]   not just as tablet, or just, you know,
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.000]   screen tablet for readers and just little quick emails
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.920]   and quick editing, but they're traveling with them
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.120]   as a regular notebook computer.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.480]   So, I think that that's, they're gonna learn that
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.720]   a certain concept that they thought were sacrosanct
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.160]   for the desktop, you know, this is, this works for mobile,
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.680]   this works for desktop, they're gonna realize that,
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.440]   well, you know what, maybe a one window,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.160]   focus, no distractions interface
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.320]   is a good thing to support on the OS level.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.160]   - So, but the thing, the question is really,
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.760]   I mean, iOS of course is locked down,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.680]   it's a controlled environment, it's a safe environment,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.800]   you know, and the question is, and there's a lot of us
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.440]   that are geeks, we grew up with our Mac,
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.040]   I mean, I grew up with an Apple II before I had a Mac,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.680]   and we're just used to the fact that we get to get underneath,
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.720]   we get to make all these changes,
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.640]   we get to adjust our system the way we want,
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.400]   but when we look at our kids, our parents,
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.240]   and a lot of our friends that are in the coffee shop,
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.560]   a lot of them are checking email, surfing the web,
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.320]   and they don't really wanna know how to run those installs,
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.480]   they don't really wanna know how to do those things.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.920]   On the other side, you've got developers who don't really
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.640]   wanna deal with DRM if they don't have to,
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.400]   you know, if that was all built into the hardware.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.680]   Aaron, is this something that is just inevitable
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.480]   that we're gonna see more and more of the iOS
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.760]   until there's really not an OS 10 the way we know it left?
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.440]   - So, your question was kind of backwards to me,
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.240]   that was you said, is OS 10 going to become iOS?
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.440]   And really what we're seeing is,
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.040]   iOS becomes more and more like Mac OS 10
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.240]   with every revision, right?
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.680]   - Yeah, it's two against one, Alex.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.040]   - Sorry, go ahead.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.160]   - And menus and all sorts of things are being added
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.960]   to iOS that are largely desktop experience.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.400]   So, when the iPad came out, people started saying,
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.360]   "Well, I wanna have a lot of my capabilities
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.280]   "from the Mac here on the iPad."
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.920]   And if there's some sort of merger happening,
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.240]   it's happening in that way,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.960]   as gradually as the devices can handle it,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.720]   more and more of Mac OS 10 is being added into iOS.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.480]   Now, technically, there are some things
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.440]   that are very elegant about iOS
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.920]   because they got a chance to back up and sort of rethink it.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.160]   The way the views and the layers work together
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.360]   is much more elegant from a programmer point of view.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.720]   But I'll be interested to see
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.560]   if those things gradually become integrated in
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.360]   with Mac OS 10.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.640]   - Just kidding. - Note also,
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.560]   that the simulator that developers use on the Mac
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.160]   indicates that everything that currently works on iOS
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.160]   is already compiled to run on OS 10.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.040]   - Interesting.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.880]   Yeah, so, and I think the thing we oftentimes forget
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.760]   is that they're both sitting on the same platform.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.000]   I mean, we're really just talking about the last 10%
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   of the iOS of exactly how it interfaces with you.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.520]   The rest of it's all the same.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520]   Or-- - Exactly right.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.280]   - Yeah, and so, now, Justin, do you see a closed system coming?
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.080]   Do you think that Apple will close the system down
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.480]   like it's closed down with iOS?
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.080]   Eventually, five years from now.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.120]   - I waffle on this a lot.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.560]   Some days, I think, yes, that's what we're gonna have.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.360]   Other days, I think, no.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.080]   If you ask me what I'm gonna be using 10 years from now
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.240]   to be building software,
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.760]   I can't see myself using an iPad running Xcode.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.200]   I think we're still gonna have,
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.360]   not necessarily Mac OS 10,
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   but we're gonna have maybe some sort of more powerful
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.680]   desktop operating system.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.360]   And we're still gonna have a Mac.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.000]   It might be running iOS as the core,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.160]   but I don't think that we're ever gonna get to a point
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.720]   where we don't need keyboards and mice for complex tasks.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.960]   Can you envision doing all sorts of complex video editing
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.280]   and after effects sort of things
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.200]   using just your finger, Alex?
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.720]   - You know, I'd say no until I started playing
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.360]   with some of the iMovie stuff on my iPhone
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.760]   and started going, "Well, you know, it's not--
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.360]   "I couldn't do it now."
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.280]   And I do agree that I don't think that it--
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.120]   I don't think we're--
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.600]   I think that there's something in the middle.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.000]   There's something where I have--
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.040]   I can have those external controls.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.280]   And to be honest with you,
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.560]   I'm not saying this like I'm excited
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.720]   because this terrifies me as a pro user
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.480]   that I would have that stuff taken away
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.880]   because it is--
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.520]   you know, the other things that scare me
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.480]   are the comments like the trucks are dead.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.000]   You know, that Apple isn't gonna--
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.600]   you know, we saw the server go away this week.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   And we see a lot of the pro things.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.800]   And I look at my Mac Pro,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.400]   just hoping that I keep on getting those
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.600]   because the Mac Pro itself is too limited for me.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.440]   I mean, I need eight slots, it has five slots.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.680]   I don't want everything to go to an iMac.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.440]   But as you start to see the, you know,
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.880]   the just blistering success of the iPhone and iPad,
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.720]   and you look at the money,
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.800]   I mean, it is, you know, Apple is making 30% on every app.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.600]   Isn't this what Steve always wanted?
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   You know, is to--
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.680]   is you have this--
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.920]   it's an incredibly good business model.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.880]   You have to admit.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.120]   - Oh yeah, Steve loves this.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.800]   He thinks this is the greatest thing ever.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.880]   But I don't think that we're gonna be able--
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   I don't think you can tell Mac users, by and large,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.240]   that they're no longer gonna be able to do the things
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.960]   they've done for 20 plus years,
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.960]   and they're just gonna have to accept, all right.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.120]   If you wanna be on the Apple bandwagon going forward,
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.720]   you've gotta use this iPad, and you have to sit there,
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.240]   and maybe type with a keyboard that you've connected
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.440]   via Bluetooth or one of those docs.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.400]   But you have to point your finger at the screen all day long.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.240]   I just can't see people wanting to do that.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.800]   I tried a couple of weeks ago,
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.520]   I was building a PowerPoint or a keynote presentation,
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.640]   and I tried to use keynote on my iPad.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.240]   And it's totally usable,
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.880]   but compared to the convenience and speed
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.240]   of using a mouse and keyboard,
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.120]   it took hours to get this done.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.960]   - Oh, I have to admit, I--
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.780]   - And something that could have taken an hour
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.560]   to do it on my Mac.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.880]   - Yeah, I don't develop anything.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.600]   Any of the IAP stuff I have to admit,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.600]   I don't develop whether it's keynote, or numbers, or pages.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.760]   I haven't found that I'm developing anything on there.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.560]   It's where I edit things,
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.720]   but they have to be kinda started before that.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.560]   Andy?
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.080]   - I don't know, I disagree with keynote.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.320]   As a matter of fact, there's so many times
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.920]   when I'm just trying to conceptually
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.800]   walk my way through presentation,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   there's so many times when I will actually build it
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.920]   in keynote for the iPad,
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.200]   because it's one of those very rare instances
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:55.000]   of a completely genetic level iPad interface
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.160]   for a familiar application.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.240]   One of the reasons why I think we haven't seen
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.240]   anything, any sort of a word processor
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   to compete with pages is because everybody's just taking,
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.600]   well, here's our cut down mobile word processor
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.320]   that we originally developed for the Palm Pilot 10 years ago,
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.880]   and we've just simply ported it over
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.000]   and are projecting it inside an iPad view.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.920]   I think that we're gonna have to see developers
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.920]   that can really grok the iPad,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.320]   just really figure out what makes it different
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.280]   and how people are gonna interact
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.680]   with user interface elements
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.160]   and the things that they're building,
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.840]   because it's just, it's harder to articulate.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.720]   It's the idea that we're not looking for,
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.040]   one of the great things about a keyboard
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.280]   and mouse interface is that it's a common point
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.400]   of reference for everybody.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.160]   We've all been using these things
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.840]   for sometimes going on two decades.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.240]   And so if a developer comes with the point of view
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.640]   that whatever interface I build is gonna involve
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.400]   moving this around and clicking this button
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.440]   and doing a lot of this on the standard row of buttons,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.640]   that sort of eliminates 50% of the bizarnus you could do
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.120]   when a developer is simply presented with here is
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.400]   just an empty field of absolutely anything
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   you can put into it.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.280]   And you can put a lot of dopey things in
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.960]   when you don't have physical keys to work with.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.000]   That's gonna be the problem.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.160]   - Well, and I know that in many ways,
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.400]   this is an issue of, we've talked about this before,
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.780]   but the idea when we started film,
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.480]   film was let's take some big film cameras 100 years ago
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.000]   and take pictures of stage plays.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.520]   And that's where it started.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.920]   And by the end of the century,
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.800]   we were making the matrix and bullet time.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.720]   And we were doing a whole lot of other things
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.440]   that you could never even conceived of 100 years before
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.960]   when they were just popping it up.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.600]   And film was not, it was taking something that we knew,
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.680]   which was stage plays and then making it
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.880]   and then adding a new medium to it.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.400]   And the same way, I find that I'm now in this situation
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.120]   where I'm halfway in between magazines.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.640]   Like I don't wanna buy any more paper magazines, done.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.160]   You know, I just don't wanna buy these.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.600]   But when I open up the magazines on my iPad,
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.920]   I'm not that happy with them.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.680]   You know, I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna,
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   the magazine format on the iPad or iPhone
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.120]   isn't sufficient for me to wanna use it there.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.840]   And so now I find myself actually reading less.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.040]   You know, so, you know, it's just this odd situation
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.160]   where it's this in between.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.720]   Now, one of the things that we're gonna find out
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.200]   a little bit more about related to magazines, of course,
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.840]   is the daily, which is, I guess, going to be announced.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.320]   It looks like tomorrow where,
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.800]   Andy, have you been invited?
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.720]   - I have not been invited.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.560]   No, I still, I--
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.520]   - Not that you're bitter.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.120]   - No, no, no, it's Rupert Murdoch.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.600]   You know, I understand that I wanna step on any toes
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.520]   by, you know, telling Rupert Rupert,
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.760]   by the way, Andy and not go,
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.960]   the one who is not afraid to speak truth to power
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.800]   is gonna be the audience.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.640]   So I understand.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.240]   (laughing)
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.280]   - What do we expect, Aaron, what do you expect to see
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.840]   with the, what do you think is gonna be different
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.840]   about the daily?
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.480]   - Well, it's an interesting question about
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.040]   what does a magazine look like when you begin
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   with the idea that it's gonna be on the iPad,
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.480]   that it's gonna be dynamic?
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.800]   I would imagine it'll be much more social process
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.040]   behind every article.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.120]   So that's been sort of done.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.160]   I imagine it'll be very pretty
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.760]   and focused on more media, so video and images.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.760]   I'm interested to see what the announcement looks like.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.280]   - I mean, to me, the perfect app at the moment
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.320]   for browsing information is Flipboard.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.440]   I mean, you know, and the only thing that drives me crazy
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.920]   about Flipboard is that it takes me out to the web app.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.240]   You know, like, I don't wanna go to their web pages.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.320]   I just wanna want, I mean, of course,
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.720]   I understand why that has to happen
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.080]   from a business perspective.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.120]   But from a user's perspective, it makes me a little crazy.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:29.960]   Justin, are you--
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.920]   - The biggest problem, go ahead.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.000]   - The biggest problem you've got
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.680]   with the magazine apps right now is,
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.560]   I'm like you, I don't wanna buy paper magazines anymore.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.840]   The happiest day I will have is when I can stop
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.080]   getting a paper subscription to Sports Illustrated
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.680]   or to other magazines I subscribe to
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.160]   and get them on my iPad, but the versions
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.440]   that are out there right now,
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.240]   beyond just having to pay five bucks per issue,
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.800]   they're designed as if you're trying to translate paper
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.280]   onto the iPad, and that's just, that doesn't work.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.760]   It's a terrible experience.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.680]   - Right, now, do you see that changing tomorrow?
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.520]   I mean, do you think that we're gonna see
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.320]   a new subscription plan as well as
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.800]   a new approach to the design?
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.320]   - Yeah, I think we're gonna see a new subscription plan,
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.560]   which is gonna be a nice thing.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   I don't know if it's gonna be enough to appease
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.600]   the Conda Nast and Time Warner's of the world
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.960]   who are frustrated that they're not getting
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   subscriber data from Apple, but I think we're gonna see that.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.680]   My biggest concern with the Daily,
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.520]   just by reading the rumors out there,
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.760]   is that it's just gonna be updated daily.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.840]   We're in the internet age.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.960]   We don't, we get, we go to the New York Times
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.360]   15 times a day and see constantly updated material.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.920]   Why would I wanna subscribe to something
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.920]   that I'm just gonna have updated once?
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.200]   And then after wait 'til the next day
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.000]   for the latest batch of news and opinion pieces.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.640]   - But then, what do you wanna do?
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.680]   Do you wanna have a meter system where you're downloaded,
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.880]   you're charged for per megabyte
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.320]   or per unit of information downloaded?
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.680]   - Well, not necessarily that.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.520]   - I don't mean to sarcastically,
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.360]   I think one of the biggest problems of this
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.720]   is just simply going to be,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.120]   how do you keep it fresh on an hourly basis,
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.520]   but still simply say that, yes, we're gonna charge you
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.440]   in a, we're gonna charge you a fee
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.160]   that's relative to the content that you consume.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.760]   - Right, and that's a hard problem,
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.480]   but my guess, or what I would like is to say,
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.080]   all right, I would like to subscribe to this
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.640]   for, let's say, 10 bucks a month
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.040]   or whatever they're charged, they wanna charge
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.720]   and that gets me access to the content.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.520]   And this is also something that I'm curious to see
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.360]   if they're gonna pass this down to developers
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.560]   like me and Aaron.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.240]   Are we gonna be able to say with our applications
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.440]   that we're not necessarily content apps
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.760]   but you can subscribe to a year's worth of updates
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.920]   to elements or a year's worth of updates
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.680]   to angry birds for a dollar or $5 or whatever it is.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.000]   Is this gonna be something that's just limited
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.600]   to magazine content or newspaper content?
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.840]   Or is this something that's gonna be translated down
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.840]   to app developers as well?
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.320]   - Yeah, I think it's gonna be interesting to see.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.360]   I think that the, I'm gonna guess that Apple's gonna build
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.120]   something that's very specific to magazine
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   and content developers at least at first
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.160]   to try to work through that process
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.200]   because I think that, and I know that for me,
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.460]   I am oftentimes very,
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:06.400]   I have different expectations of different kinds of news.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.520]   So when I go up to the front of CNN or,
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.840]   or if I go to, if I'm seeing stuff going past on Twitter
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.360]   or Huffington Post, I'm expecting something to be churning
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.760]   and changing and so on and so forth.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.800]   When I read The Economist, I expect that to be happening
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.240]   once a week and I know that they're gonna be,
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.200]   they're gonna have thought about it a little bit longer
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.960]   when the economist comes out
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.160]   than what they posted as far as,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.560]   this is just happening.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.920]   We're gonna create a little context.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.000]   Same with like, if I'm reading Foreign Affairs,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.920]   it's gonna be a lot, someone probably spent
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.920]   a couple months working on that
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.400]   and it doesn't necessarily anything to do
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.760]   with what's happening today.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.800]   So I think that we have different expectations
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.200]   of our content as far as what's coming through
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.600]   and I think daily is just one piece of that, Andy.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.440]   - Yeah, I mean, there's the Joshua algorithm from War Games.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.880]   Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.040]   If, I think that the first big successful commercial model
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.760]   for this kind of publishing is going to be to say,
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.960]   look, we've got thousands of people
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:03.360]   every single day rushing to be the first publication
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.400]   out five minutes after something's happened
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.920]   with some information about it.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.520]   Let's leave that business with those people.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.480]   Let's be the folks who a day later
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.880]   will give you a complete story about what's going on.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.720]   Not only that, but how many times have you been
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.240]   on the internet and you saw a piece about a piece of history
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.720]   or an event from five years ago with new,
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.320]   that that's a historical record, a historical document.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.960]   That's just so interesting that you wound up
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   having to insta-paper it
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.440]   because there's no way in hell,
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.240]   you're going to finish this over your bullet Cheerios
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.600]   before you get to work.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.760]   So I think those are the models that,
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.400]   those are the sort of journalism
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.240]   that commercial publications like these can do extremely well.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.160]   - Now, Aaron, do you think this is going to lead
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.840]   to an explosion of a whole new set of apps
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.400]   that are really designed for content
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.520]   that aren't necessarily just to push the magazine to,
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.360]   I mean, because right now,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.480]   one of the big things in Macworld was how to move in design,
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.080]   how to move the design that you already have into your iPad.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.960]   Do you think that the daily is going to put a lot of pressure
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.720]   on just rethinking and recoding,
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.520]   how people get content to the iDevices?
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.760]   - I don't think it's a new problem.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.640]   So if you look at a company like Vimeo,
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.200]   they've been working on it for years now.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.000]   The exact same idea of taking what's in a magazine
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.760]   and getting it into a pleasant, readable form on the iPad,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.640]   is it going to put a little more fire under them?
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.480]   - Sure.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.120]   - Every time that someone comes out with a great app,
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.520]   it raises the bar a little bit
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.600]   and that's great for the whole industry.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   - So it'll be interesting to see.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.480]   We've got, you know, so one of the things I wanted to ask you guys,
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.840]   who made it, so I guess Andy and I were the only ones
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.280]   at Macworld, Andy, were we, did you, Justin,
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.120]   I'm sorry, I'm just,
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.320]   - No, I didn't make it this year.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.800]   - You didn't make it.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.640]   - Now, is this a miracle? - It's still going on?
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.200]   - Oh, ow.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.520]   Oh, snack.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.040]   Oh, no, he did not.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:48.880]   - Oh, I did.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.400]   - Do the timer, make sure it's my voice.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.480]   I haven't been to Macworld in years.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.320]   - What happened?
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.160]   Why not?
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.000]   This is a good question, actually.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.280]   Why haven't you come to Macworld in the last couple years?
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.200]   - I guess that when Apple stopped showing up,
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.880]   that it sort of invalidated the nature
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.960]   of the entire conference,
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.520]   I think it's a great chance for--
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.840]   - Them there are fighting words.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.840]   We should have gotten Paul Ken on here with you
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.760]   and have a little chat.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.280]   - But I mean, the point is that so much news
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.880]   and information about products is available on the internet.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.600]   In some ways, a big consumer conference
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.560]   just doesn't make sense.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.640]   I don't know if CES makes sense anymore.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.000]   - You know, I think that it's,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.360]   one of the things that I find interesting is
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.320]   as someone in the press, it's very important to me.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.400]   So the thing is, you know,
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.280]   and I think that this is the only thing that happens.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.840]   I think that there's a social aspect
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.320]   of being there and seeing lots of people
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.560]   that I think is really interesting.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.160]   I think that as someone on the press,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.440]   being able to touch items and play with them
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.800]   and see how they work,
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.760]   there's a lot of things I saw there
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.360]   that I haven't seen anywhere else.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.480]   You know, that I haven't really gotten to play with enough
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.960]   to know that, oh, this is something I actually wanna use.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.880]   And as I said, as someone in the press,
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.760]   we're walking around, there's a lot of us
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.880]   walking around with cameras,
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.280]   walking around with video cameras.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.360]   And so for a developer who's putting that together,
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.680]   we had a couple of people like I had a booth there
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.920]   and showing off our little green screen.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.440]   And we had a bunch of people from the press come by
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.320]   and we know that they would not have understood
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.840]   before when we were trying to explain to them what we do.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.640]   Oh yeah, we do live stereo 3D green screen,
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.500]   you know, compositing on your Mac.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.680]   It's kinda like, you know, it's round for kids.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.120]   You know, it's hard to describe to these guys
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   like why you would need that or why it would be interesting.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.160]   And as soon as they saw it though,
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.800]   they were like, okay, we need to talk about this
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.320]   or they're taking pictures and they're taking video.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.240]   And I think that's the hard thing.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.720]   I think that the other thing that I noticed from this,
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.000]   and we almost had it working.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.720]   So for those of you listening,
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:56.760]   we tried to do this crazy thing where we had Aaron
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.360]   and Andy and I and Adam Christensen
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.240]   and Aaron was in Atlanta
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.720]   and the rest of us were in the room
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.440]   and then we were streaming it to a virtual audience
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.680]   and I couldn't quite get the audio working with Aaron
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.320]   so we didn't have Aaron in there.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.680]   But it was what I felt like is we were touching on something
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.440]   that made sense from a conference perspective
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.760]   of having the conference be a hub for a virtual community.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.800]   So we were answering questions not only from the audience,
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.600]   the 100 to 150 people that were in the audience
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.880]   but from the 300 or 400 people that were watching online.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.680]   And there was something about that
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.120]   that I thought we were touching on something
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   that made sense for a conference.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.800]   But, you know, it's not, didn't have it quite finished.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.760]   Andy, do you think that this is gonna continue to,
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.960]   I mean, do you think, what do you think
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.600]   the future is of Macworld?
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.480]   - Well, I think you kinda touched on exactly
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.040]   the secret to it.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.480]   There's always been, even when the Macworld Expo
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.080]   was the fulcrum of the entire Macintosh year
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.000]   with Steve Jobs, Keynote's a go-go.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.120]   This has always been the front of the house
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.840]   in the back of the house sort of a show
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:04.080]   where there's the stuff that anybody can come in and see,
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.880]   there's the Expo Hall, there's the exhibitors,
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.600]   there's the classes and there's the Keynote's
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.840]   but there's always been all that part of the show
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.680]   that gets sustained just by the fact that so many people
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.440]   from so many categories are in the same location
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.640]   at the same time.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.600]   I'll have so many meetings, many of which are not terribly
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.000]   related to what's happening that week in hotel suites,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.880]   and restaurants, and the Tea House,
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.920]   near the Eurobuna Gardens.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.640]   And I think that that's gonna be one of the reasons
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.440]   why Macworld Expo will always be relevant.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.600]   And that's even before you start talking
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.120]   about what's happening on the show floor.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.400]   But I think that you have a really good idea.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.720]   So long as Macworld Expo remains the idea
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.840]   that this is one week in which the focus,
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.880]   the entire Mac community, the entire Apple user community,
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.200]   can have one thing to focus on,
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.880]   that there's always going to be something interesting
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.800]   and relevant happening on that floor,
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.320]   it will definitely continue to have a reason to exist.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.560]   And if part of the reason, one of the ways to do that
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.120]   is to make sure that so many of these sessions
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.600]   are going to be live streamed,
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.320]   not just simply recorded and played back later on YouTube,
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.600]   but live streamed with the opportunity
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.720]   for actual interaction, then we're gonna have people
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.280]   who might decide that, you know,
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.800]   I was gonna have this big meeting scheduled for two o'clock
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.760]   and people from a thousand miles away
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.720]   or halfway across the world.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.600]   I was gonna have had this big meeting at two o'clock
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.280]   but I made sure I scheduled it for 3.30
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.360]   because Alex Lindsey is gonna be talking about
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.440]   this subject at two o'clock
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.880]   and I really wanted to watch the live stream
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.920]   and maybe ask him a couple of questions.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.560]   So it's so long as we make the best way to do this
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.440]   in a post Steve Jobs keynote world
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.680]   is to make sure that it is that locus,
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.200]   that's central, that's center of attention for four or five days.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.440]   - Yeah, you know, it's one of the things
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.760]   I'm always excited about going to Macworld
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.680]   and going to, you know, see, yes,
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.520]   and it mostly is that being able to see everybody
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.360]   that I don't get to see,
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.480]   that's the only time I get to see them.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.520]   And I think that there, it is easy to think
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.040]   that we can get all the information online
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.760]   but it really isn't the same as being face to face
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.640]   and eating good Ethiopian food as I took.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.320]   Andy and I went for a Ethiopian.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.720]   - It's always fun to eat with sticks.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.080]   It's even, it's just as fun to eat with your hands.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.960]   - Exactly, so the, but I think that getting everybody in town,
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.640]   I think has always been one of those things in it.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.480]   But I think that finding ways to embrace that,
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.360]   that virtual world as well and having these,
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.880]   these conferences become more like one of the things
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.720]   that we want to do.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.440]   I mean, I, we realized that Macworld,
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.520]   the Expo had become small enough that we were thinking,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.320]   you know, we could almost show people,
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.400]   like literally wander through with a live view
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.080]   and show people every single booth that was at Macworld,
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.400]   you know, which we, you know, would,
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.920]   would not have been doable, you know, before
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.880]   and let people ask questions while we're walking through
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.400]   and we were threatening to do it.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.800]   If we had one more day, we probably would have,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.760]   of course, we have one more day we would have been dead.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.280]   - So, so anyway, so, so we'll see how that goes.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.080]   Hopefully, you know, it'll, it will continue.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.200]   I'm excited to see what they do next.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.000]   I think that there's a lot of figuring out
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.240]   that needs to be done when it comes to Macworld.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.920]   And we've got, we've got some more,
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.040]   more news coming up here.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.280]   We're going to talk about Apple changing its stance
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.560]   on water damage.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.560]   We're also going to talk about the Apple TV.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.640]   So a couple of things coming up here.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.000]   First of all, we want to thank another one of our sponsors
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.640]   and that is, of course, the leader in online backup
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   carbonite and of course carbonite is, here's the deal.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.120]   You're, when you're, when you're thinking about
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:26.560]   your backup plan, one of the things that we talk a lot about
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.880]   is the need to, to make sure that you've got it
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.560]   in two places, but definitely somewhere offsite.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.320]   Now, if you're like me, you've got an office,
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.120]   you've got a house and you can put it up on both,
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.080]   in both places, but you still got to get it into the cloud.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.480]   And then, because that's the only way you know
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.480]   that the most important documents that you have,
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.480]   the most important photos of your kids,
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.600]   the most important files that you want to make sure
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.480]   that you never lose are safe.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.920]   And so, and carbonite is a great way to do that.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.880]   You know, these are the things, it's, you know,
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.200]   if you have viruses, if you have hard drive failures,
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.360]   if you have water damage, if you're,
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.240]   if you have too much snow and you're, and you're,
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.640]   not, I'm not trying not to scare you Andy,
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.400]   but if you have, if you have too much snow
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.240]   and you're, and your, and your roof caves in and,
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.680]   and gets your hard drives wet, you need to know
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:10.560]   that you have somewhere to go.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.440]   So, carbonite is great to handle all of those things,
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.600]   whether they're photos, videos, music,
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.760]   word or excel documents, it's safe,
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.320]   your files are encrypted on the way up,
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.960]   or before they get up there.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.720]   It's easy to use, so if you're a novice,
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.760]   it's easy to just, it's a couple clicks and,
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.840]   and off you go, or if you're a techy,
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.160]   there's lots of customization that you can do.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.120]   It's automatic, so carbonite backs up your files automatically,
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.880]   so you can just kind of set it up to just do it,
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.800]   because it has to be automatic,
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.680]   so you're not thinking about it,
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.640]   you're not going, oh, I'll get around to it,
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.960]   and so on and so forth, you're actually going to
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.240]   put it together and, and it is,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.040]   and your files, you know, it's just a couple clicks
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.400]   and your files are backed up, you know,
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.880]   and it's a great way to, to make sure that that works.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.160]   So you get unlimited backup too,
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.920]   it's not like you, you get five gigs here,
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.800]   eight gigs there, it's an unlimited backup
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   for your PC or Mac, and it's only $55 a year,
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.160]   that's only 15 cents a day.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.600]   So definitely check it out, you can try it for free

[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.860]   hopefully in those too much,
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.400]   you don't have to deal with anything,
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.780]   but you'll see how easy it is to set it up,
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.060]   so definitely go to carbonite.com,
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.740]   use the coupon code Macbreak, and try it out,
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.940]   it's, you just, you gotta be thinking about
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.460]   backing your stuff up in the cloud,
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.140]   with all of those things that you just,
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.020]   you know, you never wanna lose,
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.180]   and it's not good enough to just have it in two places,
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.620]   because it's, you know, if you,
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.020]   what happens if you get robbed,
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.180]   what happens if you, you know,
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.220]   if you have all those other things,
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.820]   and so those are the things I worry about
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.340]   when I leave my house,
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.140]   'cause I have lots of things in there that I'm,
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.220]   I mean, lots of data, I don't worry about the stuff,
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:56.340]   that's the funniest thing,
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.580]   'cause I don't worry about the stuff in my house,
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.340]   I worry about the data in my house,
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.620]   or in my car, or my laptop,
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.420]   and this is the best way to back it up,
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.900]   so definitely check it out, carbonite.com.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.940]   You were gonna say something?
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.260]   No, I heard somebody, I thought Andy was warming up.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.900]   So, so we have a new,
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:19.460]   we have a change in Apple's stance on water damage,
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.980]   and this is something that people have been posting on,
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.620]   you know, wanting us to talk about a little bit
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.120]   on the IRC.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.980]   So, in the past, it basically, there was an indicator
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.980]   that if it turned red, you know,
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.220]   basically they weren't gonna give it back,
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.500]   'cause it means you dropped it in the pond,
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.300]   or in the glass, or in the pool, or whatever it is.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.140]   And now, if a customer disputes,
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.500]   whether this is, if a customer disputes,
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.220]   whether the iPod with an activated LCI has been damaged
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:51.020]   by liquid contact, and there are no external signs
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:55.180]   of damage of corrosion, then the iPad will still be eligible
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.780]   for warranty service.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:01.780]   - Can I just say how upset this whole thing makes me,
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.540]   because that was really the way that I usually got
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.460]   to upgrade my phone.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.260]   As a married guy, you know, when a new version
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.860]   of the iPhone would come out, I had to find some way
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:14.820]   to discreetly, you know, cause mine to be disabled,
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.020]   and dropping it in the toilet wasn't an obvious mistake
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.780]   that you could do, and when my wife would say,
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.100]   "Well, just take it to the Apple Store,"
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.900]   I'd say, "Well, it's got the liquid contact indicator,
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.940]   and they'll know I dropped it in the toilet,
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.500]   I really need to get the iPhone 4 now."
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.100]   And this is really ruined my whole thing.
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.900]   I'm gonna have to drop it into something really corrosive now.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.420]   It's much more difficult to find something corrosive
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.860]   to drop your phone into by accident.
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:40.860]   (laughing)
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.860]   - Well, I'm sorry, so the red moisture indicator is on,
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:45.700]   but that's okay.
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.940]   We're concerned about it as the blue hydrochloric acid
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:48.780]   indicator.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.980]   - Exactly. - It's definitely a no problem.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.060]   - Actually, actually, the interesting thing
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:56.100]   about this story is that it's, I think it pretty much
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.180]   just takes an unofficial Apple Genius Bar policy
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.900]   and makes it, or at least puts it in print
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.700]   where other people can leak it out,
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.380]   because I spent a few, a couple months ago,
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.500]   I spent some time investigating,
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.900]   seeing exactly the limits of what the,
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.020]   what the guys at the Genius Bar,
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.860]   the women at the Genius Bar could do.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:16.460]   And I've really just discovered that there is an unofficial
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.660]   policy that I would term the "We're Awesome" policy,
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:24.100]   where they have incredible latitude to fix any problem.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.780]   And multiple people were telling me about times
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:30.500]   where they had brought a, they actually washed their iPhone.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.620]   There was no doubt about it.
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.460]   They were honest enough front about it.
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.380]   There was double red, triple red.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.020]   And still they said, okay, well, you know, we, you know,
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.500]   you were honest with us and you tried.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.020]   So we haven't, we will swap out a new one for you,
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.860]   even though it's clearly a warranty.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.660]   And there are stories like this that abound and abound,
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:47.500]   abound.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.940]   I talked to a whole bunch of Apple Geniuses,
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.980]   who under the agreement that I wouldn't like talk about
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.540]   who they are and that sort of stuff,
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:58.860]   but they pretty much confirmed that, yeah, both the,
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.660]   both the current ones and the, and the former ones
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.980]   were telling me that, yeah, there's so many times when,
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:04.820]   so long as you shoot straight with us,
[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.420]   and so long as we think that you try to take care
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.300]   of your iPhone or your iPad, we'll try to take care of you.
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.820]   And the things that they were doing to keep people happy
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:14.700]   was pretty incredible.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.300]   I mean, I started it off when I was trying to figure out
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.020]   if there was more breakages on the back glass panel
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.260]   and the new iPhone 4 than there was on previous ones.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:26.100]   And if so, if that was gonna be a swappable item and time and time.
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:29.060]   So I essentially just simply did an open call for it.
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.900]   If you have had a service experience via the Apple store
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:36.060]   with an iPhone 4, I tried not to lead the witness.
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:36.900]   Could you get in touch with me?
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.380]   'Cause I'd like to hear what your story is.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:41.820]   And multiple times I'd hear, I dropped it,
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.740]   the front screen, the actual LCD screen broke.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.020]   It was broken, broken, broken.
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:46.860]   It was my fault.
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.980]   It was clearly not a warranty issue,
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.660]   but they swapped it out for me anyway.
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.260]   So I was actually surprised.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:56.340]   My father dropped his, he bought his iPhone 4
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:59.100]   and within the first week had dropped it and cracked the front
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.660]   and brought it back in and they hemmed and hod for a little while
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.900]   and they replaced it.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.860]   And now he has an autobox on it or something like that
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.620]   to make sure it never happens again.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:11.860]   But it is interesting that I've definitely found,
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:17.020]   I mean, I use up, I get my Apple warranty, whatever that is.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.100]   I can't think of the name of it at the moment.
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:18.940]   Apple car?
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.140]   With everything because of the way I use the hardware
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:23.340]   I tend to win.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.460]   (laughing)
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.820]   I'm the guy that evens out all of those numbers.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:33.500]   Rarely do I lose money on that situation.
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.980]   I think there's a lot of people who take really good care
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.220]   of their stuff and never have that happen.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:41.540]   But yeah, what I'm amazed at is how often these devices
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.300]   actually survive a warm wash.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:50.300]   I left my iPhone, my last iPhone in my sweats pocket
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:55.220]   and gave it a full warm cycle and the dry cycle
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:53:15.180]   before I heard the dry cycle going (mimics a
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.180]   little bit)
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.620]   And I said, "Here, if you can make this work, then it's yours."
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.860]   Because I'm done.
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:24.140]   And he soaked it in rice for two days
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.540]   and he's still using it as far as I know.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.980]   You know, I tried to batch a home remedies
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.420]   for that, on what to do with soaked hardware.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.420]   And that clearly was obviously the best one.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.420]   Just take a dry white rice, put it in a Ziploc baggie
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.900]   with the device, whatever it is, seal it so that you're not,
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.460]   so the rice is gonna be drawing moisture from the device
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:44.700]   instead of the atmosphere, leave it for a couple of days.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.220]   If there's any chance whatsoever, it'll come out.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:52.060]   And for your phone, it still smells springtime fresh.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.060]   (laughs)
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:55.060]   So you won.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.460]   I just don't know if it would have survived the hot wash.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:59.460]   It was just warm.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.460]   Not hot.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:01.460]   So I don't know.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.100]   I might have to test that.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.100]   No.
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.620]   The key to the, going back to the Mac geniuses,
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.580]   the key to dealing with those guys or even any sort of
[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.700]   general support is just be nice.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.420]   I mean, if you're a nice to the person when you go in there
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.660]   and if you're honest and you just are friendly,
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.700]   they're gonna be a lot more willing to help you out
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.260]   and make your day a little bit better
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.060]   than if you come in there shooting flames.
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:26.220]   I think that there's a quote that my father really enjoyed
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:29.100]   saying related to Harvey, I think it was,
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:32.700]   or the, it is important to be oh so ever clever
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.580]   or oh so ever nice or pla, oh so ever pleasant.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.940]   In this world, one must be either oh so clever
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.380]   or oh so pleasant.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.900]   I've been oh so clever.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.300]   Being oh so pleasant is better.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.260]   I prefer being honest.
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.220]   But yeah, I think that's the case in a lot of,
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.940]   I mean, that's the case in many things.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:54.900]   You know, is the first thing to do is to be up,
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.060]   you know, straightforward and nice.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.580]   You were saying just in them?
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.460]   No, I'm just saying like, especially when I deal with
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:05.220]   support, I get a lot of email and 90% of the people are nice
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.740]   and I'm more than willing to help these people.
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.100]   And then, but didn't you get the people that just assumed
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.220]   that you're not gonna help them and they're just,
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.900]   they're calling you all the names in the book.
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.100]   And I see this in my email or I see it even when I go to
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:19.500]   the Apple store to buy a new piece of software or an accessory,
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.580]   you see some people that go up to the Genius bar
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:24.180]   and they're just fighting with the Genius right out of the gate
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.580]   as if it's some sort of mortal crime
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.100]   that they have committed against them.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.820]   And just that's not the way to get what you need out of people.
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:32.300]   It's just just be nice.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.860]   You can always tell the people who are former best by,
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.780]   you know, geek squad customers.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.260]   (laughing)
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:40.980]   Yeah, don't try to be an expert either.
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.700]   That doesn't really help.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.900]   Yeah, it's, I think, and that's just generally anybody
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.140]   who has authority most of the time.
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:53.140]   I had a bit of a driving problem when I was a kid
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:56.180]   that my foot was much heavier than the gas pedal.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.220]   I mean, it was like this physics problem that, you know,
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:01.220]   I tried to get treatment for and my foot just kept on
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:06.220]   just sinking down and I got pulled over 22 times
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.460]   between the time I was 16 and 18.
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:14.460]   And I got two tickets and it was mostly
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.540]   because I was really nice.
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.100]   (laughing)
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.060]   I think I turned out that, well,
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.420]   and I talked to a police officer about it
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.620]   and he said, you know, 30% of all police officers were shot
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:26.300]   that are shot in the line of duty are shot at a police stop.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.820]   You know, so, you know, a routine stop.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.140]   And so they're very afraid of you when they come out.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.500]   And if you make it so that it's a nice relaxing conversation
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.300]   for them, it's oftentimes a nice relaxing conversation
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.580]   for you and depending on the police officer.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:41.140]   So anyway, here's another stat that is starting to come up.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.100]   This is according to Netflix.
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:46.260]   Netflix is saying that the Apple TV streaming
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:49.980]   is happening more often on the Apple TVs.
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:53.420]   So Netflix streaming, of course, is available, you know,
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.700]   on your, you can do it on your iPad, on your Apple TV
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:57.980]   to on your computer.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:00.540]   And they're now saying that the highest percentage
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.780]   or the higher percentage is on the Apple TV
[00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:06.140]   rather than the iPad, which, you know, is quite a,
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:10.100]   I mean, people are actually watching content on a TV.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.140]   And exactly.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.700]   Well, that's why it's a fasting statistic.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:16.060]   It turns out that people like to watch television
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.740]   on televisions.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.420]   Well, here's the funny thing about that is that is that I,
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:24.700]   so I had taken my stationary bike and I had rigged it up
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.500]   because I couldn't, you know, I didn't want to get
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.220]   another Roku and I had as, I rigged it all up
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.980]   with all this metal and everything else
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:34.060]   so that I could have my iPad sitting, you know,
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:36.460]   right in front of my stationary, like right over the bike
[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.780]   and started watching Netflix,
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:41.100]   started streaming Netflix on it and it was fine.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.980]   And then I hooked, I got the new Apple TV too finally.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:46.060]   I was kind of delaying on it.
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.060]   And I finally, and I attached it to a slightly larger monitor
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:54.060]   and man, it's addicting, I will say.
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:58.020]   - I've watched one movie on my iPad and it's doable,
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.220]   but I don't get the appeal of doing that.
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:03.860]   I'd much rather use my Apple TV, hooked up to my 42 inch
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:05.420]   television to watch Netflix.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:08.980]   And the experience of the Apple TV Netflix integration
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:13.700]   is by far superior to the iPad or even any other console
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:14.540]   or the Roku. - Or the Roku.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.740]   - I mean, the thing is, the crazy thing is,
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:19.940]   is that I have a Roku and after I got the Apple TV
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:23.220]   working on my TV, I went over to the,
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:26.180]   into the family room and I ripped the Roku out
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.140]   and I installed the Apple TV and I was like,
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.780]   okay, I'm done with that.
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:31.780]   You know, like, you know, this is a much easier way
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.100]   to get around, much easier way to start and stop,
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.820]   much easier way to do all the things in it.
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.140]   The interface is just easier to use.
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.500]   It's simple, it's not that much different,
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.900]   but it's enough different that it was much easier
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:45.020]   to do what I wanted to do on the Apple TV too.
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:49.140]   The Apple TV one, I bought it, I used it for 10 minutes
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.380]   and then it sat in some, you know,
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.340]   first it sat under my TV for six months
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:56.260]   until I moved my TV and then I put it in a closet somewhere.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.420]   You know, so it's not like, you know, the Apple TV too,
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.420]   I think it really hit it.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.700]   Does everyone have one here or is?
[00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:02.540]   - Yeah.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.540]   - Do we don't have the only?
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:07.420]   - The only, the only advantage the Apple TV one had
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:10.700]   over the second generation one is there was so much more
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.780]   content, it doesn't seem like they've added too much content
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.660]   to this whole rental scheme that they've set up
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:18.700]   with the next generation version, which is frustrating
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.580]   because there's a lot of movies that I wanna watch
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.420]   on my Apple TV and I search for them on,
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:25.780]   when I'm sitting there on the couch and I can't find them
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:29.180]   and I just have to go and grab my iPad or grab my MacBook Air,
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:31.580]   search for it on iTunes, see that it is available
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:32.740]   and then get it through there.
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:35.860]   That's frustrating to me because that wasn't the case
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.740]   with the previous generation.
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.860]   - Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see how that moves forward.
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:44.740]   I do find that now with Netflix, if, you know,
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:47.020]   I don't, I got a lot of content.
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:50.780]   I don't really, you know, between Netflix and my home library,
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:53.820]   you know, I have a hard time justifying pain for rental.
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:57.500]   Like I accidentally got into the Apple store
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.180]   and I was like, why is all my Netflix costing $3.99?
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.020]   What happened?
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:01.860]   Are they changing everything?
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.300]   And I was like, I was all, I was all freaked out.
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.820]   I was like, this is gonna ruin everything.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.100]   And then I was like, oh, I'm in the wrong room.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:08.940]   I'm in the wrong room.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:13.180]   I can move along and get back to my little environment.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.820]   And, but it is interesting that Apple
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.260]   has built the best platform for Netflix.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.500]   Now, one of the things that one of the rumors
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.060]   that we're hearing now is Amazon is looking at doing
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:25.140]   a subscription service for Amazon Prime members.
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.940]   Do we think that, do we think that we're gonna see,
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.820]   will Apple TV do an update and start supporting Amazon?
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.220]   - Sure, why wouldn't they?
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.060]   - Yeah.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:37.380]   - Well, well, because Amazon is selling purchase content,
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.860]   brass Netflix is just doing subscription.
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:40.540]   - Well, Amazon's talking about doing a subscription.
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.780]   So the idea is if you're in Amazon Prime,
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.860]   the rumor is is that if you're already doing Amazon Prime
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:47.940]   that you would get access to up to 5,000.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.180]   - No, no, no, I'm saying, I'm saying,
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.460]   I know that they're, that the rumor is that they're
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:54.580]   getting into the subscription game, but Apple,
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.860]   the only reason, the reason why Apple would not do it
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.620]   is that Apple would also, excuse me,
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.460]   Amazon would also be very, very pleased if,
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.460]   instead of purchasing stuff from the iTunes store,
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.100]   you actually purchase stuff from the Amazon digital store,
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.540]   so that when the next time you wanna see the next,
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:13.540]   the next Juda Freelander film, you paid $12,
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.740]   not to Apple, but to Amazon.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.900]   So I think that, I don't know, we'll test out
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.300]   the parameters of the is Apple, a bunch of evil,
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.260]   money-grobbing scum, if that were to happen,
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.180]   and if we just see, if the test will be--
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.500]   - You have to put them on the spot.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.420]   - Well also, there's the question that they have yet
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.740]   to support Amazon digital streaming,
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.740]   even though Amazon is one of those features
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:39.980]   that you tend to find on just about every HDMI, HDTV,
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.140]   internet box that you find.
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:43.100]   I think they're, I've got three in the house right now
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.460]   that can access Amazon digital content,
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:50.620]   so why is that one app not available on the Apple TV?
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:51.940]   - By the way, one of the things that I noticed
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:55.940]   with my Apple TV too is that, in case you wonder
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:59.060]   whether the cheap HDMI cables are any different
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.700]   than the expensive HDMI cables, it turns out
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.540]   that when you're connecting your Apple TV too
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:08.060]   to your TV, it makes a difference.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:13.060]   I had the $3 HDMI cables, and I was getting the HDCP error,
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:18.860]   so it can't sync, and I went through a bunch of complaining,
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:23.180]   I think I might have tweeted a couple angry notes.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:28.180]   And then finally put in a much more expensive $40 cable
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.140]   and it has worked fine ever since.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:34.980]   - Now my question, damn you monster, damn you.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.140]   Anyway, it's all I have to say.
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.340]   - My question as a developer is,
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.160]   when are they gonna let us write applications
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.740]   for the Apple TV?
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.660]   I mean it is an iOS device at this point,
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.220]   why can't I write apps that run on it?
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.580]   - That's exactly where I was going with that.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.820]   So the issue is, now that we have the Apple TV,
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:51.580]   now that it's over a million sales,
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.500]   we have a platform there, and it is iOS.
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.620]   I mean it's just iOS, there's nothing else to it,
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.940]   other than it's a little box that runs iOS.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:00.740]   When do you think we're gonna get,
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.620]   see when is Apple gonna open that up?
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:03.740]   I mean there's been a lot of,
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:04.900]   when you talk to people at Apple,
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.260]   there's a lot of wink, wink, non-non,
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:09.060]   like we know that it can, it could run any of this.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.420]   Is most of this an interface issue?
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.180]   Do you think that Apple's trying to figure out
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:15.580]   how are you going to interface with your Apple TV
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:18.340]   that would be different than your iPhone?
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.700]   I think airplanes, they're platform.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.300]   Sorry, go ahead Justin.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.020]   - No, so I think AirPlay is gonna be their platform
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.100]   for the Apple TV, just because I can't really think
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.380]   of that many applications that I would want for an Apple TV
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.220]   beyond just playing audio and video content.
[01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.620]   - Angry Birds. - So if you enable,
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:36.900]   - Angry Birds. - You really wanna play
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.580]   Angry Birds on your TV?
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.620]   - No, but look at it this way though.
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.940]   So here's how you would do it though.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.980]   You would grab your iPhone, you say,
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.660]   use AirPlay, send the video's content up to my Apple TV
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.260]   and then you control it using your iPhone.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.860]   I don't think that you're ever gonna see an iOS App Store
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.300]   for the Apple TV directly.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.180]   I think what you're gonna find is a lot more applications
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.660]   for the iPhone and the iPad enable you to push the video
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.020]   content from the app onto your Apple TV
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.420]   and subsequently onto your television.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:09.740]   - Maybe but it seems like a lot of work,
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.460]   just to get, I mean, when you have a device that already
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.220]   is capable of running the application,
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.620]   running it through virtually, seems like it's a lot
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.060]   of, it seems like it's going to affect performance.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.460]   Andy?
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.020]   - I think that it's gonna be more,
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.500]   I think the first thing we're gonna see
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.860]   before the full app store, the full app thing
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:32.220]   is going to be just the idea of WebKit coming onto Apple TV
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.500]   and any remote service that wants to create an Apple TV
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.180]   sort of service or an Apple TV, whatever, widget.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.380]   We'll be able to do that not by pushing an application
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.660]   but by simply pushing an alert to app,
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.100]   there'll be like an Apple TV inbox that simply says,
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:52.500]   oh, because you, essentially, I'll go onto flicker.com,
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.260]   I'll say, oh, by the way, I have an Apple TV,
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.100]   here's my Apple ID, could you please,
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.460]   like, give me access to the flicker web tool
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:02.860]   that gives me more power than simply slideshows.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:06.540]   And then I would find an inbox item in my Apple TV,
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.100]   I click on that link unbeknownst to the user,
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.060]   it's just simply opening a webpage that has
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.340]   that really cool HTML5 sort of interface to it.
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:18.300]   I think that the biggest problem with Apple developing apps
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:23.020]   for the Apple TV is just simply describing,
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.500]   here is the unit of interface between the user
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.620]   and the Apple TV.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:30.540]   - Well, and it's part of the problem, though,
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.060]   the issue of Apple not wanting to make the Apple TV
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:35.260]   too complicated is part of the issue,
[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.820]   like we don't want you, we want you to just think of it
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.540]   as, I mean, Apple does this a lot.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.580]   We want to give you something like,
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.860]   they gave us an iPhone without anything, you know,
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.580]   when we complain and complain that we don't have applications.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:48.420]   And now they've sold, is it 10 billion applications
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.900]   or distributed 10 billion applications?
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.380]   And so is the question like, we want to get you focused
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.660]   on using the Apple TV the way we designed it
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.820]   and then we're going to open it up?
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.380]   Do you think that's, is it a step-by-step process?
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.420]   - Yeah, I think, remember what they've done with the iPad
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.340]   and what they did with the iPhone.
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:07.020]   The iPhone, day one, did about 60%
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:10.460]   of what every competing smartphone at that time could do.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.780]   And we had a way to couple you, a year and a half years
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.100]   that was suckers.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.340]   - No, because the whole package was good.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.220]   It was okay to do without cutting paste for a while,
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.740]   lift the non-cutting and non-pasting apps,
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.220]   still kick the butt of everything I could do
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.820]   in my blackberry or my Windows smartphone.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.500]   So I do think that that's coming,
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.220]   but Apple's never been in a rush to meet anybody else's time
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.700]   to able about their own.
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:32.540]   - Very interesting.
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.300]   So I mean, what would you, Aaron, Aaron,
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.820]   what would you write for the Apple TV
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.660]   that would be new and different?
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:44.060]   - So just thinking about social media, you could do chat,
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.700]   you could do a browser Facebook page.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.460]   There's opportunities like that.
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.340]   There's media, so you could imagine applications
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.340]   that would be musical so that you could compose there
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:55.900]   in front of your TV.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.900]   My TV has a decent sound system, a lot better than my phone.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.580]   That might be a nice way to work with it.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:06.780]   - Yeah, the FaceTime is something that I feel like
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.780]   would be really interesting, you know, with it,
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:10.420]   being able to put that into my,
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.100]   especially as I think of my parents,
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.540]   you know, with my parents, you know,
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:16.380]   not wanting to have a lot of stuff they're carrying around,
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.860]   not quite, but having something that's stationary,
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.980]   that people can be using their iPhone and calling in
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.660]   or going from Apple TV to Apple TV,
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.100]   it just seems like it'd be so Jetsons.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.620]   So, in some ways.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:27.620]   - That's future.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.940]   - The future, yes, exactly.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:32.900]   It's a future as envisioned in 1962 by the World Spare.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.260]   (laughing)
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.260]   - Exactly.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:39.100]   - The future, 1977, boom, boom, boom,
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:43.100]   that are mixing you drinks with robotic nuclear power.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.500]   - So now, here's an interesting little tidbit.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:50.540]   Apple, not Apple, AT&T, okay, we got Verizon coming out.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:53.900]   It's going to be available at midnight, I believe,
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.980]   on the third.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:59.100]   And so for current users, and then the 10th,
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:04.060]   for everybody else, AT&T is reportedly quietly offering
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.700]   customers unlimited iPhone data plans,
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.500]   again, to try to, you know, let's hang on to them.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.860]   So this is according to Apple Insider,
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.900]   and according to the Associated Press.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.780]   And so it's basically an unadvertised loophole
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.740]   that they're trying to retain some of the customers
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.980]   who contact customer service.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.820]   So, it seems like things to do here,
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:27.940]   whether you are planning to leave or not,
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:29.980]   and you don't have the unlimited plan,
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:33.620]   is it to at least do a little saber rattling.
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:35.220]   Andy, do you see yourself rattling?
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.860]   Oh, you don't have to rattle the saber.
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:37.700]   - Exactly.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.220]   Well, I'd like to be free of the fear that
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:44.700]   if I were to just sort of send one text message to many,
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:48.220]   they would use that as well, because we noticed you
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.900]   sent 10 more text messages that are in your existing plan,
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:52.660]   we have switched you to an expanded plan
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.780]   that gives you more free text messages,
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.940]   and because we switched your new plan,
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:57.100]   we've also taken it off the free unlimited.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.740]   - Anyway, so I'm traveling to Europe in a couple of weeks,
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.460]   I'm like, do I really,
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.980]   which I switched to the international roaming plan
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:07.060]   and risk that they won't,
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.460]   that will use it as an excuse to take me off of unlimited.
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.300]   But even now I'm sort of thinking that this is sort of
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.420]   like a disinformation program to say,
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.220]   if we make them think that they could switch back
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:23.020]   at any time, maybe this last 500,000 people
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.940]   who are still giving unlimited internet to,
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.980]   who are streaming Netflix 24 hours a day
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:29.460]   just to stick it to the bad, we'll come back.
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.940]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.660]   - Yeah, I have to admit, I'm also terrified
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.820]   of losing my unlimited plan.
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.500]   You know, it's one of those things that I,
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.820]   and it scared me the first time,
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:39.940]   but the international plan for me,
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:41.460]   I spent too much time outside the United States,
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.140]   and so I'm constantly turning it on and off,
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:45.420]   which you can do, by the way,
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.180]   and here's something else that you can do
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.340]   is you can actually, if you forgot about it,
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.140]   you can actually call AT&T three days
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:55.340]   into your trip to Japan, and they will back,
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.700]   if you ask for it, they'll actually,
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.260]   you'll say, oh, I forgot to turn this on,
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.220]   and they go, oh, we'll just set the date
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.140]   three days before, or four days before,
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.380]   and start it up, so it's actually a pretty
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:04.780]   flexible little thing, and so far,
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.500]   as far as I know, I haven't lost my unlimited data,
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.460]   but of course, I don't really know
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:12.460]   what goes on with my bills, my wife will tell me,
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.700]   and there's so many people attached to my plan,
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.020]   I don't know.
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.580]   So anyway, so we'll see how that goes.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.100]   Any other news that we should be covering,
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.980]   did I miss anything, that we have to,
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:26.100]   I think we're winding down here.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.260]   We're gonna get to the picks of the week,
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.100]   we're gonna start going around,
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.900]   and this is a warning for Aaron and Justin
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.260]   that we're coming with the picks of the week,
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:33.980]   but before that, we wanna thank, of course,
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:38.980]   Audible.com, Audible of course is the way,
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:42.500]   the best way to read books, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:45.020]   It's funny, I was talking to my dad
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.740]   some last night about some other stuff,
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.500]   and he was talking about the girl
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.620]   who kicked the hornet's nest, and he said,
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:53.220]   oh, I love that book, and I was like,
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.220]   when do you actually read that book?
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.340]   I didn't read it, I listened to it on Audible.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.300]   I didn't know it, the idea might,
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.140]   you know that it's getting mainstream when my dad goes,
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:02.860]   I didn't read it, I mean, come on now,
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.740]   I mean, you wouldn't even consider that.
[01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:07.500]   And so, you know, Audible.com is really the best way
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:11.580]   to do that, it is a, you got 75,000 books
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.700]   that are downloadable, titles, everything from literature,
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.860]   fiction, nonfiction, periodicals,
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:21.780]   and for listeners of Macbreak,
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.700]   Audible is offering a free audio book
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.220]   that you can try it out, so if you haven't done this before,
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.420]   you gotta go up, it's free.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.540]   It doesn't cost anything, there's no risk.
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.300]   Go up there and download a free book
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.980]   and see whether it's something that works for you.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:37.580]   I know that it's something that I'm just downright addicted to.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:41.700]   I don't really consider, yeah, I don't like unitasking.
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.740]   I think that's the bottom line, I'm an anti-unitester.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:48.580]   You know, I know that Aaron, I think, you know, constantly,
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.420]   not constantly, but during our class,
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.580]   when I was in Aaron's fine class,
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.740]   there was a, I was talking about a need for focus.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.340]   It's not something I'm pretty good at.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:59.980]   It's not, I like to think about six things at one time.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.980]   And maybe it's slowing me down,
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:03.740]   but Audible is the perfect thing for me.
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:08.740]   It allows me to clean my house, to drive, to walk,
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:13.980]   and still continue to accumulate lots of useless information.
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.660]   So anyway, definitely check it out.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.260]   And of course, if you're thinking about it,
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:20.740]   Andy generally has a suggestion
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:23.740]   of something you might wanna think about downloading.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.020]   Yep, my last pit was a couple of weeks ago,
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:29.340]   and I finished that during one of the transcontinental flights
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.140]   in San Francisco, Sideways,
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.140]   which was definitely delivered to the goods.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.620]   The next one, I haven't, I barely started my next one.
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:40.820]   It's a non-fiction book that will really have importance
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.220]   to a lot of people who are listening right now.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.260]   It's called The Emperor of All Maladies,
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.540]   a biography of cancer, and I will never pronounce
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:51.740]   the author's name right, and I will not offend,
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.540]   I'll offend the author by trying.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:57.740]   But it's a really fascinating story in which,
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.100]   the author is an oncologist who,
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.300]   after starting the specialty of oncology,
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.500]   decided to keep a journal just,
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.820]   it's just as a way of sort of keeping grounded
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.300]   and keeping sane because it's incredibly challenging
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.820]   field to work in.
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.140]   And this journal sort of spun out into research
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.940]   and the history of cancer, the story of development,
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:20.420]   not only starting with 4,000 years ago,
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.260]   the first documented cancer treatments,
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:24.500]   which was, as you can guess, pretty barbaric,
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.660]   to the ongoing attitudes about the disease,
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:30.340]   about how in the 19th century,
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.060]   the first real breakthrough came in when the understanding
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.220]   that all living things are made out of cells
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.260]   and sometimes these cells just sort of go nuts
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:38.620]   and that's the basis of all cancer.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.700]   Before then, it was just this weird malady
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.100]   that would just, if you got it, boom,
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:44.660]   you're gonna die horribly within weeks.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.580]   You would still get, and then in the 20th century,
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:51.020]   where filled with hubris,
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.660]   this is the story that the book seems to tell,
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.060]   that early on, doctors and the scientists
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.060]   were sort of filled with hubris,
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:02.060]   that cancer patients were just pretty much just objects
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.940]   that you treat the hell out of,
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.660]   then without really caring about what they're going through,
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:08.620]   without really caring about whether or not this treatment
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.780]   that they're gonna try out on them
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:11.860]   is gonna do any good or extend their lives
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.140]   or extend their quality of their lives at all.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:17.340]   And the book talks a lot about what these treatments are
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:22.060]   and how absolutely radical a lot of these treatments were.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.460]   And then it goes to the periods in which
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.620]   they get their first successes where they see that,
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:28.860]   you know, we managed to put cancer into remission
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.780]   for the very, very first time,
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:32.940]   a kid who was very near death,
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.420]   who'd been sick for a year and a half,
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:37.060]   they gave him the brand new inrenous treatment,
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.620]   and two weeks later, he was sitting up
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:41.460]   and actually talking and eating and extended his life.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.460]   So, and there's also lots of personal stories
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:47.220]   about modern treatment, about what cancer patients go through
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:51.620]   in modern times and what the process is
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.700]   of going from a Rhodes Scholar
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:57.260]   and just being a regular doctor to committing to this
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:01.180]   at times just horrible, horrible, horribly tough,
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.580]   emotionally practiced to go into.
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:08.860]   It's like so many of people I've lost
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.180]   very, very close members of my family to cancer.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:14.220]   And so it really gives you an idea
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.340]   of what the entire world is up against,
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.740]   the successes, the failures,
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:20.180]   and if anything else, the optimism that you know,
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:23.060]   that if the, you know that there are people
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.460]   who are working on this day and night,
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.500]   that there are people who have gone through this
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.820]   and gotten to the other side of it,
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:29.660]   and the most hopeful part of this entire book
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:31.020]   is the explanation that there are people
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.900]   who are actually curative cancer.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.460]   And that it really does tell you about
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.860]   the entire universe of this disease.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:41.660]   And it's not, I've read a lot of nonfiction books
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:44.420]   where I was more attracted to the topic than the writing.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:48.260]   There's a book about the engineering behind the lunar lander
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:51.380]   written by the program manager, which is like,
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.940]   okay, so why did you switch from 5/16 to 2/8
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.420]   of thread screws for the paneling displays again?
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.940]   And he's gonna tell you every detail
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:01.340]   of how that screw was developed.
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:03.180]   But this is more of a story.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.500]   The author is an exceptionally good storyteller
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.420]   and it's just eminently readable from start to finish.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:09.340]   So again, I haven't finished it.
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:11.300]   I've only gotten through the,
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.420]   as I usually do when I sample an Audible book,
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.940]   is that I'll actually download the Kindle version
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.500]   where I can read the first bits of it,
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.460]   then I'll start listening to about the five minute sample
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:23.780]   that's available on Audible.com,
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:27.540]   just make sure that the reader is someone that I like.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:29.180]   And I'm only about two or three chapters in,
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.020]   but already I've actually sort of like stopped it
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:35.100]   because I know that I'm flying to Europe next next,
[01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:37.060]   in a couple of weeks, I need something for the plane
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.580]   rise over and I wanna save something good.
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:39.780]   This is really good.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.740]   I know for me, I get into these books
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:44.500]   and when I finish one, I feel so,
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.260]   it's like, it's there and I almost wanna listen to it again.
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.860]   - You know, like, and I'm scared of committing to another one.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.060]   Like I've just finished this one
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:51.940]   and then it takes me a little while.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:53.300]   There's like this little break
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.420]   where I don't listen to anything
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:55.340]   'cause I don't know what to do next.
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.540]   I kinda, you know, that was so good.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.460]   - The only disappointing thing about so many
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:00.700]   of these Audible books is that,
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.820]   at least when I'm reading a book, a physical book,
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.780]   I can, when I was reading a paper book,
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:07.380]   I could sense that, okay, the pages in this side of my hand
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:09.180]   are getting thinner than the pages on this side.
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:12.180]   I need to emotionally get ready for the time
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.500]   when I get to the end of this book
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.300]   and I cannot read any more of this.
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.020]   With Audible, it's like, you just,
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:20.340]   like, this beautiful chapter, like, oh boy,
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.260]   that's wonderful, what are the next chapters about?
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.980]   This was an Audible book.
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:25.180]   - Yeah, yeah, I do Audible.
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:29.020]   - Oh no, no, no, no, sir, no, don't go as Audible Guy, please.
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.340]   - And I got back to, I was listening to "Thousand Hills"
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:33.220]   from Stephen Kinzer about Rwanda
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:36.180]   and, you know, I've been with him through the, you know,
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.700]   revolution and genocide and rebuilding the country
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.500]   and then we get to the end and it's gone.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.100]   It's like, okay, what's the update?
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.020]   I mean, do you have something else I can listen to?
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.940]   I mean, I feel like I just got there.
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:47.420]   Yeah, so anyway, check it out,
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:51.220]   audible.com/macbreak, audible.com/macbreak.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.940]   Get your free book today and try it.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:58.540]   And I just apologize right now for the addiction
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.460]   that will come soon after.
[01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:02.660]   So it's just such a great service.
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:06.140]   So anyway, so now we have our picks for the week
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.540]   and I'm gonna throw this back to Andy
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:11.740]   'cause I'm sure that he's ready for his pick of the week.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:12.620]   Andy?
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.100]   - I'm ready and I'm not ready in the sense that
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.700]   my pick of the week is an awesome device
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:20.740]   that first got on the radar several months ago
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.620]   when it started off as a Kickstarter project.
[01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:26.260]   I finally got my hands on a real one last week at the show
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:28.780]   because they had a booth there.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.340]   It's called the glyph and you can check it out
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.780]   at the glyph.com.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:37.020]   It is such brilliant engineering.
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:41.460]   What it is is it is a hybrid iPhone 4 stand
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.580]   that can be used to hold up the iPhone
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.940]   in any configuration you want it to be.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:47.500]   And here you're picturing your mind,
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:50.980]   oh, it's a stupid like bulky, like big max size
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.860]   tri-pot attachment with a big screw mouth
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.220]   that you'll never ever use.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:58.500]   No, what it is, it's like a 3D of high impact
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.820]   plastic bookmark that you don't really know how to use it
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.820]   until you see it being used.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:07.660]   And then you realize that it's a kickstand
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:08.940]   with a clip on the end of it.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:12.340]   It's about this big, like a kind of like a field hockey stick.
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.700]   I'm sorry I don't have it with me
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.780]   only because it's so small, it's somewhere in my bag
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.220]   and I have yet to find it, but I know it's in there somewhere.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.180]   So it's a $20 little thing.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.780]   You can hold it up, you can use it,
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.460]   you can clip it onto the top of that square edge
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.580]   of the iPhone and just simply use it as,
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:30.700]   and just simply use it as just a lean two stand
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.180]   that's on your desk.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.380]   Or you can clip it the other way and hold it up vertically
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:38.980]   because it's not like a banana case.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:42.100]   It's just a clip that simply adds a little kickstand to it.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.380]   So vertically, horizontally, doesn't make a difference.
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.500]   Or because the actual longitude of it
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:51.820]   is a little rail that clips onto the side of it accurately,
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.340]   you can also clip it on like that
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.060]   and then you have a tripod screw mount at the bottom of it.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:58.860]   So it will work on any tripod that you have
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.660]   and will work horizontally or it will work vertically.
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:04.540]   And it's a tiny, tiny, tiny little device.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.380]   Again, it's about this big.
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:11.580]   It's 20 bucks, but it's better than so many of these little
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.460]   stands and adapters that I've seen that cost
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:17.340]   two or three times as much for the simple virtue of the fact
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:19.860]   that you will actually have this with you when you need it.
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:21.180]   You will actually carry it with you.
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.300]   It will be the stand that you always use.
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:26.500]   I'm not a big fan of these kickstands.
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.300]   Sometimes you'll find cases and other stands
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.140]   that will let you prop up your iPhone.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:33.540]   I like them in that there are times when I like to have it
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.460]   on my desk so I can actually keep an eye on the timer,
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.140]   keep an eye on a timer that I've got running on what I'm saying.
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:41.340]   But I just never find it worth the bother taking with me.
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:44.420]   And the glyph is so good that I will always, always have them
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:44.940]   with me.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.860]   I picked up actually three of them.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:49.340]   And there's one of them that will always be in my laptop bag.
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:50.940]   One of them that will always be in the suitcase,
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.580]   always travel with, and one that I'll probably lose pretty
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.860]   quickly because they're tiny, tiny, tiny objects.
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.260]   That's how convenient they are.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:58.580]   And I love the story behind them too.
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.340]   Yeah.
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:01.700]   Well, so these guys, the developers,
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:04.180]   I talked to them a little bit at the show,
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:08.340]   they thought of a really good idea.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:10.180]   And then they built a 3D model of it.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.140]   And then they printed it with shapeways.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:16.860]   Shapeways is this company where you can email your file to them
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.420]   and they'll send it back to you, print it out.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.620]   And so they had it printed.
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:20.940]   And then there's this little--
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.940]   then they put what's called a quarter inch 20 tap into it,
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.660]   which allows you to screw this on to your tripod if you want to.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:30.700]   And then they showed it.
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.900]   And they made a video about all the different ways
[01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:33.740]   that you could use it.
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.940]   And you can do this, you can do this, you can do this.
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.540]   And they put it on Kickstarter.
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:39.660]   So is that right?
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:40.940]   Kickstart.com?
[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:41.620]   Kickstarter.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.060]   Kickstarter.com.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.540]   And put it up there so people can bid on--
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.140]   you can help fund them and help--
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.460]   and then they said you can have one.
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:49.820]   If you help us fund it.
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:50.460]   Right.
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:51.660]   The basis of the funding is that we
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:53.100]   don't have the money to build these.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:57.860]   But if we raise $15,000, that's enough for us to do the tooling
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:59.260]   and actually manufacture these.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:01.100]   If you give us a dollar just on principle,
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.460]   we'll thank you very much.
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:05.100]   If you give us $15 or $20, we'll actually send you one.
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.180]   If you give us $100, we'll send you two.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.540]   And we will drive your house and kiss you on the lips.
[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.140]   And with all these Kickstarter projects,
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.740]   the point is that you have to set exactly how much money you
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.420]   need and how much time-- a time limit
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.820]   on how much time to raise it.
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:20.260]   And so many times it's like we need $100,000
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:24.260]   to do a video on jazz in Upper Mongolia.
[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.940]   And they'll get like $500.
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:30.420]   They were trying to raise $10,000, and they raised $130,000.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.660]   It was such a great idea.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:32.180]   Yeah.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.820]   And it's just-- and it is-- and when you see it in use--
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:35.420]   Yes, there you go.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:37.260]   So I was hoping you'd have a picture right there.
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:38.260]   I had it.
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:39.420]   Yeah, computer.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.020]   And it's so wonderful.
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:46.660]   Because if I were to leave this behind in a bar,
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:49.300]   people would think it was like a bottle opener or something.
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:52.020]   They would never figure out that it's an iPhone stand.
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:54.500]   But the minute you see one person using it,
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.820]   the next question is going to be, what is that?
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.980]   And how can I get one for myself?
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:00.420]   It's such a clever idea.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:03.660]   You almost want to just give them $20 just on principle
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:05.980]   for being such a bunch of clever little boots.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.140]   Yeah, I have to admit, my brother
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.540]   is like never buys any of this stuff.
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.380]   And as soon as we finish shooting an episode about it there,
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.380]   he was like, OK, I need to go get one of those.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.540]   So anyway, it's great.
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:18.260]   It's the best $20 you'll spend as far as supporting your iPod.
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:21.220]   OK, Aaron, you're up next.
[01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:25.740]   All right, so you probably know the big nerd ranch does training.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.540]   We teach people how to do iPhone programming
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:30.220]   and desktop programming.
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:31.860]   But we also do a lot of consulting work.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.020]   And one of the things that we've been dealing with lately
[01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:38.060]   is big corporations have become fascinated with the iPad.
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.740]   And in particular, the idea of using the iPad
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:44.220]   is sort of a window into their huge databases
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:46.500]   so that they can look at their existing data.
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.620]   And so we've been really doing a lot of deep thinking
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:50.620]   about how to present information.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:55.060]   And not just information, but really knowledge on the iPad.
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.460]   And one thing you don't know about me
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:00.980]   is I'm a really bad saxophone player.
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:05.740]   So I came across the history of jazz iPad app.
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.460]   And I have to say it's just incredible.
[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:11.620]   It's an incredible way of getting an understanding of jazz
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:14.740]   and how it evolved over time and through different threads.
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:19.100]   And just as a triumph of the future of when we take books
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.380]   and we merge them with video and interactive learning
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:27.140]   processes, the history of jazz is kind of where we're all going.
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.700]   And I think it's an interesting look
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:32.500]   at where we're going to expect to see everything
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.740]   in a few years.
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:34.940]   Very interesting.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:35.620]   And it's available.
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.700]   It is somehow I ended up in the Apple.com UK.
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.860]   But it is-- here it is--
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:43.700]   history of jazz.
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:47.060]   And it is, I guess, eight bucks or nine bucks.
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:48.460]   Trying to make a quick--
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:53.300]   I did that course you Google and you end up in--
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:54.820]   It is $9.99.
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.060]   $9.99.
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:25:01.100]   It's $5.99 in pounds in the UK, but $9.99.
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:04.020]   And if you're into jazz, that's the place to go.
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:06.420]   Or if you're just into the idea of information design,
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.380]   laying things out.
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:10.060]   So as far as just a reference of putting all this stuff
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.140]   together, which I think is important,
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:13.740]   because I think that there is a--
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:16.700]   yeah, when it comes to e-learning, education,
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.100]   and so on and so forth, I think these
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:19.060]   are going to be great platforms.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.620]   And we still haven't figured out exactly how to make all of that.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:22.140]   Exactly.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:24.540]   And this is the indication of where we're going.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:24.940]   Fantastic.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.100]   I'm going to get it just for that.
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:27.820]   So definitely check it out.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:29.660]   Justin, what do you got for this?
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:29.980]   All right.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.780]   I'm going to use my Liberty and have two picks.
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.100]   So my first pick is on the Mac App Store.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.860]   It's a great app if you're a developer,
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.580]   because one of the things we have to do with Objective-C
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.340]   is we have to create these accessor methods.
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:43.100]   And basically, these are ways that we
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:45.660]   can mutate and change our variables
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:47.380]   in a little bit of a safer way.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:51.100]   And it's a little bit easier to do this now with Objective-C 2.0
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:52.940]   and what we have called properties.
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:55.060]   But it's still a lot of manual typing.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:57.380]   And then there's this great $20 application
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:26:00.460]   by a guy called Kevin Callahan called Accessorizer
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:02.260]   that I'm really starting to use a lot more now,
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:04.140]   because basically what it allows me to do
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:07.340]   is create some variables and say, all right,
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.100]   I want to create an in-s integer.
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:10.820]   I want to create an in-s string.
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:13.820]   And then I pop it into Accessorizer, click a button.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.540]   It generates the properties for me,
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.420]   as well as the synthesized statements
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:19.140]   and the deallocation stuff,
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.300]   so that all I have to do then is just paste that
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:24.380]   into my class file in Xcode.
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:25.780]   And so it's $20.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:27.100]   It's up on the Mac App Store.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.340]   And it really saves me a lot of typing.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.500]   And this, it's auto-complete helps a little bit with this,
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.860]   but when you're working in Xcode all day,
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.780]   saving every little keystroke you can
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.900]   is a really good thing.
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:41.980]   So check it out, search for it on that Mac App Store.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:43.820]   He's got a really great video on the front page
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:45.140]   of the site outs we're just showing.
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.740]   So if you go to a bit.ly/accessorizer,
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.020]   you can just watch this video
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.020]   and it gives you a quick demo of all the cool stuff
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.340]   you can do with this application.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:57.460]   My second pick is a charity related thing.
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:27:00.340]   And some of you might remember about a year ago,
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:03.140]   I put on this charity fund called Indie Relief,
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.860]   which was basically built around doing
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:07.340]   a one day charity event where developers
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:10.260]   gave their day sales for the Haitian Relief Fund.
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.900]   And I'm not doing that again this year,
[01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:14.660]   but my pal Scotty is doing a charity fund
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.620]   called Developers Against Poverty.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.300]   And it's running over the next two months
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.020]   and it's at developersagainstpoverty.org.
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.340]   And basically what he's trying to do
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:25.780]   is raise $50,000 to give clean water to people
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.380]   who don't have it using a popular charity
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:29.740]   that a lot of people might have heard of
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.340]   called Charity Water.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:33.900]   And developers are gonna start contributing to this
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:36.460]   and giving sales however they see fit.
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:37.780]   Or if you're just a consumer,
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:39.740]   you can just go and give donation to it.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:42.180]   And his ultimate goal is $50,000.
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:44.300]   And so I'd really like to see him to be able to get that
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:47.620]   because in a world where we're able to have iPads
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:48.940]   and buy new iPhones every year,
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:51.620]   there's still people out there who aren't getting clean water.
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.060]   And that's not a good thing.
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.260]   So I'd really hope that we can raise this goal for him.
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.420]   - Is this the ad with,
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.620]   hold on, you guys see the ad for this?
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:01.460]   Hold on.
[01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:05.820]   See if I can, have you seen this ad?
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:06.740]   - No. - No, I haven't.
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.820]   - It is, the ad that they do for Charity Water,
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:11.020]   hold on, let me make sure I got my MacBook
[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:12.100]   all you muck here.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.100]   Let's see here.
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:19.940]   Let's see.
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:24.040]   (gentle music)
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.620]   (gentle music)
[01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:29.200]   (gentle music)
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.780]   (gentle music)
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:34.360]   (gentle music)
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.940]   (gentle music)
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:39.620]   (gentle music)
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:42.200]   (gentle music)
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:44.880]   (gentle music)
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:47.460]   (gentle music)
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:50.040]   (gentle music)
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:29:19.660]   [Music]
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:27.660]   Anyway, I think it's just such a great ad for, and making it very clear, and I do a lot of work in Africa, and so it is very much that problem.
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:34.660]   So, anyway, it's a great, really, really great organization that's putting that together. Did you have anything else you want to say about that, Justin?
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:42.660]   I think that's pretty much it. Just developers against poverty.org or Twitter.com/devs against Pov I believe.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:52.660]   Okay, great. Thank you very much. Okay, I guess I have to think of something really quickly. So, now I have, so I had to use it for a little while.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:59.660]   I talked about it, I think, at CES, and I talked about it, and I finally can go ahead and recommend it.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:04.660]   I should have brought the piece of hardware. I forgot the hardware. I was rushing out to get here this morning.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:12.660]   So, my recommendation is going to be the eye grill. So, people have been making fun of it. I just want to say, people were making fun of the eye grill at Macworld.
[01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:22.660]   They were like, when they talked about the most absurd thing they saw at Macworld, they were like, "Okay, there's a meat thermometer that you can connect to your iPhone. That's just crazy."
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:29.660]   Well, I have to say that. I have one. And I didn't, they didn't send it to me as a demo. I bought it.
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:39.660]   I paid good money for it. And I've tested it now on a few, some tri-tip and a chicken and some lamb.
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:47.660]   And so, here's the deal. So, if you're going to buy a barbecue and you want to buy the Mac of barbecue, you get a big green egg.
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:53.660]   That's what they call them, these big green eggs. You have a lot of those down there in Atlanta, don't you, Aaron? Because that's where they're built.
[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:56.660]   Oh, yeah. Big green egg is based here. It's a cult here.
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:02.660]   So, I have a big green egg. I have my big green egg. And one of the things about the big green egg is that it keeps all the heat in.
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:09.660]   And so, what you don't want to do is constantly be opening up your barbecue. You want to keep it shut and you've got a little temperature gauge, the big green egg.
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.660]   You can put the temperature gauge, there's one on the outside and you can check it out.
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:17.660]   But most people who use a big green egg that I know, and once you have one, it's like a Mac.
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:20.660]   Like once you have one, suddenly you just start running all these people and you start talking about it.
[01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.660]   And it's literally like, it's like a Mac for barbecue.
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:29.660]   Anyway, so the thing is, is you want to have a remote temperature gauge and then you also don't want to stand around looking at it.
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:34.660]   So, I've bought all these remote gauges. They're Bluetooth or whatever they are.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:37.660]   And so, what you can do is you stick this, it's got a little transmitter and you stick it in.
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.660]   But then you've got this big crazy thing that you're carrying around.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:43.660]   And I'm like, I don't want to carry this around. I don't want anything.
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:47.660]   The only thing I want to interface with is my iPhone.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:54.660]   I want everything. I want my refrigerator, my washer and dryer, and my toaster, and my coffee, and everything else just to go into one interface.
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:59.660]   I think people should just stop thinking about that and just make things that work with my iPhone.
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.660]   And so, this is great examples.
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.660]   And all this is a remote sensor. It's a little box.
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:07.660]   And then you've got, and I think I got a whole bunch of stuff here.
[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:17.660]   I can't wait to go to Big Green Egg World next year.
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.660]   I want to go. I want to cover it.
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:21.660]   You know, like we cover Mac World.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:23.660]   I want to come.
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:26.660]   It'll spill a little up better than any other experience.
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:27.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:29.660]   So, this is what it looks like here.
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:32.660]   So, you can see it here. It's this little box with a little heat, a little meat thermometer.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:35.660]   And you can actually have two different sensors plugging into the same one.
[01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:39.660]   And then what happens is that you get everything goes into your iPhone.
[01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:42.660]   So, then you can go back to watching the Steelers.
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:47.660]   So, you're watching the Steelers play, watching them win, of course, because they're the Steelers.
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:53.660]   But you can, it'll give you a little, you actually get a graph that shows you the trajectory of your meat.
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:59.660]   So, you can see like when it's going to be, it tells you roughly, you can see this little graph going up.
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:01.660]   There's a couple of things that I would check.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.660]   When it's in the background, the graph restarts.
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:06.660]   And there's a couple of little things like that.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:11.660]   But overall, the interface is beautiful and it's just very Mac-like.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:17.660]   And it's just a great, you know, I just, anyway, I'm just very happy with it.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:22.660]   And one of the reasons I wanted to recommend it was specifically because people saw it at Mackerel
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:23.660]   and said it was crazy.
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:24.660]   And I was like, it's not crazy.
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:27.660]   If you know what it's used for, it's just great.
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:30.660]   So, anyway, if you like meat, you love the I-grill.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.660]   Yes, yes.
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.660]   That's why you hate the I-grill.
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:38.660]   I believe it's $100.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:41.660]   I mean, for the box.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:44.660]   And then it is a, yes, $100.
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:50.660]   And then if you want an extra sensor, it'll be an additional $20 for the second sensor.
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:56.660]   And the reason you want second sensor is if you've got, you know, chicken and beef on the same grill.
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:57.660]   You want to do it for you.
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:02.660]   As someone who is constantly on the verge of poisoning myself when cooking, I'm intrigued to be able to do it with my iPhone now.
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:11.660]   You know, I have to say that I don't really, and this is evidently a common thing that happens when you get a big green egg,
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:14.660]   is that I don't think of my big green egg as my barbecue.
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:15.660]   I think of it as the oven.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:18.660]   Like, I mean, if I'm going to cook something, that's the only place I cook it.
[01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:19.660]   And I'm on morning meetings.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.660]   My morning meetings are usually when I'm on the phone.
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:26.660]   I'm sitting there scraping the big green egg and preparing it for the evening, you know, to cook whatever we're going to cook.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:31.660]   And the biggest problem I have is that my wife and my kids can't eat meat as fast as I can cook it.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:37.660]   So, but the, so, but the what, what makes that really work is the technology.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:41.660]   It's being able to measure that heat because that's the only way to get really, really great meat.
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:42.660]   It's all I got to say.
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:44.660]   You've got to know exactly what the temperature is.
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:50.660]   And so anyway, I know that that's a half of a commercial for a big green egg and half commercial for I grill,
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:53.660]   but they're both great and they work, you know, they complete each other.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:55.660]   So you're missing a trick here.
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:00.660]   If you don't find a way to work in a plug for Omaha Steaks because you're not going to have to do it.
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:05.660]   Because, you know, you're already got like two companies that will probably send your free stuff now.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:09.660]   I don't think I'm going to get free stuff from either one of them.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.660]   But, but the, but I would like to get it.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:13.660]   I would like to mention, you're not going to.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:14.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:21.660]   I, I, I, I would like to say how much I like Omaha Steaks and, you know, anyway, so.
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:26.660]   I'm really trying to resist making a joke about a big green egg world keynote by Steve Kibobs.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:31.660]   That's all I got to say.
[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:33.660]   Justin, where can people find you?
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:34.660]   All right.
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:41.660]   So you can find me at secondgearsoftware.com if you want to check out the apps or you can be my friend at twitter.com/justin.
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:47.660]   And Andy, where can, where can be, where's the best place for people to, to find you?
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:53.660]   Somewhere in the middle of the snow, grinning when I actually like Jack Nicholson after failing to kill my family with an axe.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.660]   It's really snowing a lot over here, guys.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:58.660]   I've, I'm starting, I'm starting to really not like it.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:06.660]   Or, but web wise, you can go to anotco.com or www.cwob.com.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.660]   And Aaron, where can people find you?
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:11.660]   You can buy my book at Amazon.
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:14.660]   I'm programming the Big Nerd Ranch Guide.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:18.660]   I, bignerdranced.com is the website.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:21.660]   We have a class on iOS starting on February 21st.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:23.660]   We have another one on March 12th.
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:26.660]   We do consulting and we're always hiring.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:29.660]   So if you're smart and hardworking, send us a resume.
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:30.660]   Jobs@bigdirdranced.com.
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:33.660]   And I can personally vouch for the, for the class.
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:34.660]   It is awesome.
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:37.660]   Me and, me and a couple of our folks sat through it, as many of you know.
[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:40.660]   And, and it, it was great for us.
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:42.660]   What we're doing is we're preparing to, to build apps.
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.660]   We're not planning to write them, but we needed to get our head around it and we needed to get it in.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:48.660]   And if we were planning to write them, this was the perfect thing for us to get into it.
[01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:51.660]   And there was a lot of people that were there to start programming.
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:57.660]   For us, it was just important to get our head around what was required and what, what, what, what it could, what it could do.
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:05.660]   And I think the book is a great way to start because it's really what the, you know, the class is based on, but it's, but, but there's a lot in the class that is not in the book.
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:06.660]   You know, right?
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:11.660]   I can vouch for the books because the gentleman in the cowboy hat has taught me everything I know.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:14.660]   Hey Justin, is that one of my books on the shelf behind you?
[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:22.660]   If you look my friend, all three of your books are back there, the co-co programming, the Advanced Mac OS X programming and the iPhone programming.
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:24.660]   All right, I was just asking.
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:25.660]   Can I have a free cowboy hat?
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:26.660]   For sure.
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:27.660]   All right.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:28.660]   All right.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:32.660]   So until, until next week, get back to work.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.660]   Break time is over.
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:44.660]   [MUSIC]
