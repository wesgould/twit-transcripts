[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.200]   fine as a fiddle.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.080]   Mr. Andy, I don't know what a fiddle is, but you're fine.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.080]   Mr. Andy Nocko from Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.360]   Good to see you.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.120]   It is a fiddle and ready for love, Leo.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.920]   Yes.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.960]   Andy just serenaded us with an Elvis song, which is quite--

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.280]   We can only hope.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.720]   I'm hoping this goes viral.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.920]   It might.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.280]   This America's Got Talent being rated by millionaires.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.000]   America does have talent.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.480]   Speaking of talent, we also have with us,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.880]   I'm really happy to say from MacCast, Adam Christensen.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.640]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.280]   Great to see you again, Adam.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.840]   Yeah, it seems like I just saw you.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.600]   He was just in studio with us two days ago.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.280]   And I said, why haven't we had you lately on Mac break weekly?
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.960]   And he said, well, I don't know why.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.080]   I've got a microphone.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.760]   I've got a puff protector, and I'm not afraid to use it.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.400]   Yes.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.760]   And so here he is.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.560]   It's almost like a nice little goat
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.120]   tea or something, if I can--
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880]   Yeah, position just properly.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.160]   Also here-- and I hear about-- I'm going
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.440]   to pronounce his name so correctly--
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.760]   from the typical Mac user podcast, Victor Kaeyao.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.320]   Oh, those were Dalset Tongue.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.600]   Did I say that right?
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.960]   Kaeyao.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.000]   Kaeyao.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.800]   Victor was also in studio on Sunday.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.640]   I guess Victor and Adam and Gene McDonald from Smile
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   and Chris Breen.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.760]   And who else?
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.480]   We're all in Petaluma.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.280]   Well, Jeff Gamet from Mac Observer was with us,
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.000]   but he had to catch a flight before.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.280]   So he wasn't able to make it into the studio,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.640]   but Jeff Gamet, Brian Shafen, Derek Story.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.880]   Is there--
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   Derek Story.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.120]   --doing some photography stuff?
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.800]   Yeah, it was great.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.480]   It's amazing.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.440]   What a great-- this is for the North Coast Macintosh users
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.720]   group.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.600]   They have an annual Mac Fair, Mac Convention Expo in Petaluma,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.520]   which I've never made because I do a radio show on Saturdays.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.960]   And I'm tied down here.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.320]   But it's nice that you guys came by.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.280]   Thank you.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.840]   And thank you.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.760]   We're talking about a wife I think we found our retirement area.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.880]   Isn't it beautiful here?
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.560]   Oh, I came home and I said Hillsburg specifically.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.160]   I said, we're going back, and we're
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.280]   going to go look for homes.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.800]   I mean, it's a beautiful area.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.400]   Hillsborough, you're talking about?
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.040]   Oh, Hillsburg.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.560]   Hillsburg.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.040]   Hillsburg.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.560]   Hillsburg.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.760]   Hillsburg.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.680]   Oh, it's gorgeous.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.280]   That's the wine.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.080]   That's the heart of the wine country.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.520]   Yeah, I love Hillsburg.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.720]   Great restaurants here too, Victor.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.920]   Next time you're up here, let me know.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.160]   I'll take you and the Mrs. out to Cyrus, which
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.040]   is a wonderful restaurant there.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.640]   There's also--
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.240]   Thanks, Devon Week.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.040]   We're already planning on--
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.520]   All right, I'm serious about this.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.440]   There's some great restaurants up there.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   So let's talk Macintosh.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.600]   First of all, apology.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.720]   I think we only have one Macintosh story all day long.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.120]   Would you rename Maccast to "Padcast"?
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   No.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.640]   No.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.120]   No.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.120]   No.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.360]   I think we're safe.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.880]   We talked about this, right?
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.920]   The branding.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.120]   And you've got Mac break weekly.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.960]   Mac break weekly.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.080]   But we don't talk about Maxima because all the action--
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   I mean, Apple, obviously, still makes Max and OS X and I
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   work in iLife, but all the action's
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.240]   happening in the portable space these days.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.400]   Yeah, we talked a little bit about that at the conference.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.720]   The theme was iFuture, and it was what's happening.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.200]   There seems to be a big focus on iOS now,
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.000]   and what's happening with Mac OS.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.600]   And I know the pro guys are getting a little impatient now
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.400]   about what's happening with the pro apps and things like that.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   Right.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.240]   I think there's a rumor that the final cut--
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.280]   the new final cut is soon to be out, right?
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.640]   Have you heard that, Victor?
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.360]   We hope so.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.240]   I mean, I've been reading some of the boards from the pros
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.880]   and stuff, and there's just a lot of buzz
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.680]   that there's some last-minute delays I heard again.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.960]   But all the pro guys are really ready.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.160]   And some people-- I mean, BBC, they jumped ship
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   in winter premiere just recently.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   What?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.800]   Yep, they did.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.320]   They did.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.880]   And so this--
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.760]   Mac and Tash premiere, not Windows premiere, right?
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.240]   I think that they actually went to the Adobe product,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.560]   because they're corrected.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.360]   But they're running it on Macs, not Windows.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.560]   Oh, yeah, I'm sure of that.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.600]   Because premiere for a long time, you couldn't get premiere on Mac.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.440]   But I think you can now.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.520]   Am I wrong?
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.960]   No, you can't.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.480]   No, you're right.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.440]   So at least they didn't have to scrap their hardware.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.160]   But there's some real concerns out there
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.560]   in the pro community about what it's going to be
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.440]   and if it's going to fulfill everything.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.800]   Between that and I've had discussion several times.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.240]   Between that and then getting the hardware
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.400]   to spare you know, with things like USB 3, this kind of thing.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.640]   Andy, you've kind of-- you've said they're never
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.760]   going to neglect the Mac.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.200]   No, I just think that this is a time
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.480]   when they need to get the kid up upright, talking,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.160]   eating, talking, and then off to school.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.440]   And then they'll bring their attention back to Mac OS.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.520]   The other big problem is that they don't--
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.880]   I'm not sure whether they're planning on 10.7 or 11.0.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   And so I'm really interested in anybody who wants to know
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.000]   what Mac-- what Apple's going to be doing next year.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.080]   I really think this is one of the first times in 10 years
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.840]   that in terms of the Mac hardware and software goes,
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.120]   the ball's completely up in the air.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.720]   And you really-- it's a hard time to really guess
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.080]   what they're going to keep up to.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.800]   I mean, Snow Leopard really was hardly--
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.640]   I mean, it was very-- a minor upgrade.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.600]   It was a polish even.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.960]   They even Apple said it.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.400]   And Apple said that well before it was released.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.680]   They were always saying that 10.5 is going
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.680]   to be the last real Gates of Gamora scale update
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.320]   to the OS for a while, because that's the first one
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.560]   where they feel as though they've checked off just about everything
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.920]   that was on the list for Mac OS 10, which it sort of leaves us
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.760]   thinking, are they going to put it in maintenance mode at this point?
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.400]   Or are they now thinking about the next wave of devices
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.480]   that they've got on the chalkboard for the next three years
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.800]   and these sort of operating system that will unite all of mobile,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.320]   all of the cloud, and all the desktops together into one.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.240]   They might be a lot more ambitious than just adding support
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.160]   for new printers.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.520]   Is it a challenge though to think of what you could do?
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.120]   Our panel was really reaching the conclusion
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.040]   that the cloud was something that was going to be a big factor.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.960]   And you bring up the data center.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.920]   Everybody wants to know what's going on with that data center.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.680]   Project-- what is it?
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.840]   Project Dolphin?
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.880]   Is that what it's codenamed?
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.600]   I had not heard that.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.000]   I think something like that.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.840]   Well, yeah.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.720]   We still haven't heard-- everybody thought, oh, maybe that'll be their lala,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.600]   or their video streaming center, or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.000]   nothing.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.320]   Yeah, we were just thinking it might need to be bigger with the iOS devices.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.280]   And like Andy was kind of mentioning,
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.680]   there seems like a bigger update that's going to converge
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.280]   and kind of bring all these things together.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.920]   And whether that's based on iOS or OS 10,
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.200]   iOS is based on OS 10.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.040]   Right.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.320]   As in our chat room--
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.200]   let me give them credit.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.880]   As I bookery says in our chat room, Project Dolph Lundgren.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.800]   That was destined to go down an obscurity.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.920]   I have to say, I mean, I look at what Microsoft has tried to do with its cloud
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.680]   initiative.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.600]   And they've done a lot of stuff, but boy, it sure hasn't captured
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.120]   the imagination of its users.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.880]   I mean, you can get office in the cloud now.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:57.120]   You can-- they've got BPOS, which doesn't stand for what it sounds like it stands for.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.440]   It's the worst acronym ever.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.640]   It's something business-something.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.520]   Also, it's the key of underpromise and overdeliver.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.720]   And with POS as part of your name, you cannot put overdeliver.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.640]   Promise any less.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.480]   Anyway, let's do our two Mac stories.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.720]   And then you Macintosh folks can go back to your nap.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.520]   Go back and cuddle up next to your big teddy bear of hate
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.280]   that you sleep with every night.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.520]   I got my 27-inch love it.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.240]   Love it.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.680]   Immediately hooked up my MacBook Pro to it.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.480]   And I love-- you just plug it in.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.400]   And it runs great.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.720]   And it's a beautiful nice screen.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:42.200]   And I guess there's something more to say, $9.99 available now.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.400]   Good screen.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.720]   It's a cinematist playing.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.360]   I was like converted to 30-inch.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.640]   It's smaller.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.640]   I know that.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.520]   Three inches.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   Color-wise.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.040]   You know what?
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.800]   The interesting thing.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.480]   I have a 30-- and the 30's more fourth is 4-3.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.440]   This is 16-9.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.720]   So even though it's 27 inches, it doesn't
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.640]   feel like such a big screen because it's wide.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.640]   But great for watching TV.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.800]   It's kind of like a little small TV in my office.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.560]   It's got its own speakers, and its own camera,
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.680]   and its own microphone.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.960]   So it kind of is its own--
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.480]   But based on that, I mean, it's not
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.000]   to bleed into the non-dustop part of our show.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.640]   But it's interesting that the same month
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.520]   they come up with this really superb 27-inch screen,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.560]   probably the best consumer display
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.320]   you can get towards watching media.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.440]   And yet they choose to make the Apple TV 720p, not even
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.200]   for photos.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.360]   Will you be able to exploit that big screen?
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.560]   Interesting.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.280]   Although there's no facility for hooking up an Apple TV
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.200]   to the 27.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.240]   It doesn't have an HDMI.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.440]   You'd have to buy an adapter.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.320]   Yeah, but it's interesting that they don't get these things
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.520]   working together a little bit better.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.760]   And by all means, tell me to save this for the next segment
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.920]   or not.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.880]   I was out of town, unfortunately.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.160]   It's during my primo, laying on the sofa,
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.320]   doing extremely intensive research from the Apple TV time.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.920]   And so I've just been spending the past two or three days
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.160]   making it go through all of its really heaviest paces.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.200]   And the only places where I'm really disappointed with it
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.120]   are where it's doing things like being a flicker photo viewer.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.040]   And that's the one place where you realize that, oh, God,
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.120]   I really wish that there were more detail on this display.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.000]   And on this device.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.160]   So I just think essentially there's that disconnect
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.960]   where they appreciate that some people are going to need to--
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.040]   will want to spend a $600 premium on a really, really top notch
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.440]   27ish display.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.240]   And yet for the rest of the world, it's--
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.200]   and we need to make this $99, even making this $109
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.280]   to make it support.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.360]   1080p is not acceptable to us.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.520]   It's also-- I don't know.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.240]   Do they offer a-- mine was glossy.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.560]   I didn't even notice if they offered a map.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.080]   My 30-inch is matte.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.600]   I like glossy, but I know I'm one of the few.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.840]   But see, I could sit in the dark.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.080]   So it looks good in the dark.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.800]   It's good to see him putting--
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.360]   Go ahead, Nick.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:11:59.960]   Right, let me--
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.160]   Second.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.320]   It's good to see him putting something in this space
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.560]   because it gives hope to the continuation of the truck line.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.280]   And I really hope that the truck line continues
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.960]   with the Mac Pros and all of that.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.040]   So it's good to see them.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.920]   I think this is the right step in that direction
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.120]   to what we'll see next year when it comes to hardware
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.520]   and what Steve calls the trucks, what I call the trucks.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.880]   So it's a good sign.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.920]   Steve, famously, it is all things D-speech said,
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.960]   you're always going to need trucks.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.520]   But in fact, every car originally was a truck.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.920]   I don't know if that's actually true, but he's--
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.320]   it's kind of bending history to suit his needs.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.280]   But he says, and in the early days of PCs,
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.360]   every computer was a truck.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.520]   And you'll always need trucks, but fewer and fewer trucks
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.520]   are going to be sold.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.040]   More and more, we're going to see the sports cars.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.760]   And I guess he thinks of the iPad as the sports car.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.760]   One more story.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.000]   And then we will start talking about the portable devices.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.920]   The one more story that we're going to talk about today,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.880]   Office 2011, will be available in three weeks.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.600]   Thank you very much.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:03.000]   Now you can boldface like never before.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.160]   I'm holding down the Z key.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.200]   Do they have-- are they putting a ribbon in 2011?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.760]   Yes.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.760]   I think they've gotten rid of the menu bars,
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.120]   which a lot of people really don't like.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.600]   Except that how you do a ribbon-- it's not Mac-ish, right?
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.480]   Because the menu bar and the Mac,
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.400]   you got the menu bar at the top, unlike Windows,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.440]   where it was part of the window.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.080]   So you could replace the menu bar in Windows with the ribbon.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.440]   But in the Mac, now you've got a menu bar and a window,
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.600]   which is not according to Mac guidelines.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.080]   Right.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.000]   So that was why they didn't do it, I think, for so long.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.680]   Well, you look at the iPad and stuff like that,
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.360]   and the end of the--
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.240]   What does it mean?
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.360]   What does it mean anymore?
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.320]   Right.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.200]   Look at the-- look at iTunes.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.240]   What the hell is iTunes?
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.880]   You even look at Apple's own stuff.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.000]   Ribbon Schmibbins says Web93.90.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.640]   They were at the Expo this Saturday,
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.120]   and I saw their demo.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.320]   Microsoft.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.200]   Microsoft was.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.160]   In the big thing, they were touting with speed.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.320]   That was the side-by-side comparison
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   or the speed comparison between how it's running now
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.800]   and how it used to run.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.480]   And I just thought to myself, well, geez,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.440]   so much of that has to do with the architecture,
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.840]   and not so much whatever they particularly
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.200]   have done to office.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.600]   I'm not an office user day by day,
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.640]   but that to me seemed to be what was really being emphasized.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.000]   Not UI, not maybe super-enhanced features,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.080]   but how much quicker of an experience
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.000]   you're going to get in Office 11 than you used to get.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.680]   Well, that's good.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.520]   What about this reordering of layers feature?
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.240]   I just thought in the demo video, Victor,
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.680]   did you see the demonstration of that,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.160]   where they have this sort of mode?
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.600]   It looks like the expose kind of mode they did in Windows XP,
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.080]   where the whole document kind of comes up,
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.040]   turns on its side and then layers out.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.600]   And supposedly you can then drag different layers
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.360]   to different levels.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.200]   Layers?
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.360]   Yeah, of what?
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.520]   Nice to--
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.160]   In Word or PowerPoint.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:53.920]   So if you're trying to--
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.480]   Layers of meaning?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.720]   No, layers of content.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.880]   So you layer up content when you're working on a project.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.840]   If you have an image and you want to move it to the back
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.520]   or text, you want to move it to the front.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.320]   It was like really whizbanging in terms
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.480]   of the visual interface, but it's one of those things
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.120]   where you just put in paint and polish on stuff.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.280]   And it may add to the functionality.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.960]   It may not, depending on how well it works.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.360]   And that's why I was curious to see
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.000]   if they had shown that to Victor.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.840]   They did show it.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.320]   To me, it felt gimmicky.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.600]   It just wouldn't use it that way,
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.920]   especially if you've been a long time user of these products.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.360]   You know, you're going to use the shortcut keys,
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.680]   just like we do with a Mac.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.960]   So the chatroom's saying, no, there's no ribbons.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.000]   And then I don't know.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.320]   But you saw ribbons, Victor.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.960]   I believe I did see ribbons, yes.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.040]   Well, they're not calling--
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.360]   I don't think they're calling it the ribbon.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.480]   They have some other name for it.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.160]   Maybe.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.240]   The thing of naming, Entourage, is gone.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.280]   And they've got Outlook.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.040]   But is it Outlook or is it just Entourage named Outlook?
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.120]   Look, I got looked to me.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.320]   It did not look like Entourage.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.680]   So it has the Outlook UI.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.600]   Yes, it does.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.680]   OK, that's good.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.240]   Because nobody likes Entourage.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.080]   But lots of people use it because businesses use exchange.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.000]   And I think it's just kind of a natural to use Entourage
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.840]   with exchange.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.400]   So it is Outlook.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.200]   I have to use Outlook every day at work.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.320]   So I run away from it as often as I can when I get home.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.960]   You recognize it.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.120]   You recognize it.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.040]   All right, Michael, it just shows you the kind of trouble
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.840]   that Microsoft is in or the problems that they face,
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.160]   that more and more all of their business
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.680]   is not involved in serving the needs of the person who's
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.560]   going to be actually using the software.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.880]   It's always about selling 100 seats, 200 seats,
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.560]   500 seats of the software.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.760]   So just like the relationship that BlackBerry has to its users,
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.160]   the BlackBerry is not the phone that people come in to buy.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.360]   It's the phone that they're handed when they get this new job,
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.040]   along with their new security pass.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.880]   I think the Microsoft's in that same sort of issue
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.440]   when they're designing their operating systems
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.040]   and designing their-- especially their office suite.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.480]   So it's a very, very different thing.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.560]   I think that when you compare pages for the Mac
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.720]   to Microsoft Word, that's really where that sort of thing
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.880]   shines through.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.000]   I'm sure that there are folks in the office group
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.600]   who would love to do something that is truly
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.160]   innovative and truly different.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.680]   But they know that they have to make sure that the thing that
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.800]   will help one college student write a thesis is not the sort
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.520]   of thing that they can really apply
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.800]   to 100 people in a different work group,
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.840]   all running two different operating systems
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.480]   and working on 800 different projects.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.480]   I mean, at least as far as I remember,
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.160]   Office is the best-selling Mac app out there, right?
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.560]   Yeah, still is.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.480]   And it's still the one Heinz 57 app that you need.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.320]   In terms of getting the work of business
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.160]   and the work of your home business done,
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.400]   that's the Heinz 57 app.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.600]   That if you have a good work processor,
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.000]   you have a letter writer, you have a page compositor,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.120]   you have a web publisher, you have a book editor,
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.480]   whether you're just writing that 10-page paper
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.000]   or whether you're writing a collaborative 400-page document
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.840]   that has four authors and go through three different edit
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.760]   cycles with notes and revisions.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.880]   It's a mace of the same, in many ways, simple little app
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.280]   can handle all that sort of stuff.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.040]   It's just not a sort of venue in which you can participate
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.680]   in the freestyle portion of the competition.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.280]   It's all about the compulsory.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:03.800]   Right.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.920]   Well, and in fact, that's what Word is on the PC2
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.080]   or offices on the PC2.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.440]   It's all things to all people.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:17.160]   And everybody uses a small slice, 5% of the full power,
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.080]   but it's different slice for every group,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.920]   so that's why it's all there.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.320]   And I prefer-- if you ask me, I prefer a power tool
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.280]   that does what I want to do.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.760]   And I think that's what we talk about.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.080]   So Leo, you're saying that this is a classic case
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.880]   of when you've got four people making the same pizza order
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.680]   in one group.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.400]   It's like, can you do one half pepperoni
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.880]   with four vegetarians?
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.840]   Exactly.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.440]   That's what it is.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.040]   A little anchovies, but not so many people can't pick it off.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.480]   That's what it is, really, right?
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.560]   And now they're still giving you the home edition,
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.520]   the business edition, the student edition.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.280]   So they've had different price points.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.000]   That's the big problem I have with it.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.640]   Geez, just come out with one edition that's price right,
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.880]   either for a single license or a family pack.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.960]   Be done with it.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.480]   You still have to go out there and look at all the choices.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.080]   I think it's 119 for the home or student edition.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.240]   And home and business is 199.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.600]   I'm confused already before I even download it.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.440]   So that's the problem.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.200]   Again, Microsoft has Office Online, which is free to use.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.040]   And it's simple, but it has a lot of the functionality
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.080]   that probably most people want, including, I would think,
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.120]   students.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.720]   It's total.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.320]   I mean, if you're using Google Docs, it's very similar.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.560]   A couple of questions.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.080]   Do people use Open Office on the Mac?
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.920]   Much?
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.040]   Why are they not using Office Live on the Mac?
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.400]   I mean, why buy this big old honking thing?
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.840]   I guess because nobody ever got fired by buying IBM.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.040]   Well, also because it's the one that will absolutely never let you down.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.680]   You know it'll do everything you need.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.280]   Yeah, I think that there are very few people
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.800]   whose needs were not going to be served by Google Docs or Office Live.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.600]   But then you'll get into that one project where someone will just assume
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.640]   that you have Word.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.880]   Usually it's anything in which you are no longer working alone.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.040]   And then that's when you wish that you didn't have to take something down off the cloud,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.760]   adapt something from the writing style that you developed just for Google Docs.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:15.040]   And find a way to use the same app that everybody else is going to be using once it has to leave your own brain space.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.760]   Office is the safe choice then.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.880]   It's a safe choice.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.800]   Usually when you say something like that, you mean it in a slightly denigrating tone.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.320]   Yes.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.120]   But in fact, in fact--
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   It's a matter of fact.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.480]   Yeah, and there's something to that.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.840]   But it's not the sort of thing where they're not producing a really, really solid product.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.840]   Again, I just feel as though they're pretty manicaled by it.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   You see, there's so many times when you see the first work of a developer after they leave a big product team.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   Like the people who leave the iPhone team and they start producing their own iPhone software.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   The people who leave the Office team and start working on their own editors.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   And you see all the ideas.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   It's sort of like when George Harrison left the Beatles.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   Right.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   And he came out with a three disc album.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.840]   Just the most incredible stuff that he was never able to do when he just got one track in a beat.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   One track in a beat.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.840]   Exactly.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   And it's funny, but it is actually true.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.840]   I can almost come up with all these different apps that--
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   Then you have Ringo.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   Even Ringo had a hit album after he left the Beatles.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.840]   It's a time issue to my wife's a teacher.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.840]   And she just doesn't have the time to learn something new.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   You know, it's all her teachers use it, all the people in the union use it.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   She's not going to go through that learning curve.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:27.840]   She's got 31 kids.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   Period.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.840]   So Office, not only is it safe, it's what she knows.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840]   Yes.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.840]   Yes.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   Boy, man, we managed to squeeze quite a bit of a conversation out of Microsoft Office.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   Who to funk it?
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   We have now paid our tribute to desktop computing 2010.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   I want to talk-- we got lots more to talk about.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:55.840]   Clean the fact that the iPad is the fastest selling new category in the history of consumer electronics.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   But before we do all that, let me talk a little bit about my friends.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   These are the Citrix folks who do such great products.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   And go to Assist.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.840]   Express is one of them.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.840]   Based on their remote access backbone, go to Assist.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.840]   Express is for the support professional.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.840]   You know who you are.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   The people who spend time on phones saying, "Okay, it's in system preferences."
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   "Okay, click the network pane."
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.840]   "Okay, click the advanced--"
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.840]   If you've ever been there, if you just wish, you could reach out into that computer and
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.840]   fix it yourself.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   This is the program for you.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   Mac or PC, you could fix a PC from a Mac.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.840]   You could fix a Mac from PC.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.840]   That's nice.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.840]   Go to Assist.com/-- let me get this right.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   Mac break.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.840]   You could try it free for 30 days.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   They have day passes.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.840]   So if you're not doing this day and day out, if you're not a pro doing this, but maybe--
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   I know probably most of the people listening are the tech support team for their family
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   and friends.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   You designate one day a month.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.840]   Do it on the 31st.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.840]   That way you get a few months off.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   On the 31st of every month, I will fix your problems.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   You buy the day pass and see the beauty is, your supportees don't even have to know about
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.840]   go to Assist or anything.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.840]   You just send them an email with a link.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.840]   It'll take them to go to Assist.com.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.840]   They'll automatically populate the ticket number.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.840]   And the software downloads in like 30 seconds.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   It's very quick.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.040]   Java, pretty sure it's Java based.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   Pretty quick.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   Gets in there.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   And then now you're in the system.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.240]   You're fixing their computer.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   You could do all sorts of things.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:34.120]   Eight sessions at once means you never have to wait for an install or a hot fix or an upgrade
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.840]   or whatever, a scan because you're moving on, moving on, moving on.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.320]   They'll always tell you what operating system is running, what a background software, including
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   security software, is running.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.960]   You don't want to run a file of that.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.680]   You could drag and drop files from your computer to theirs.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.040]   So if you want to bring cocktail over or whatever, you could just drag it over.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   What else?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.640]   This thing is just fantastic for support.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.840]   It's remote access built for support.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.760]   I want you to try it for a 30 days.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.840]   Go to assist.com/macbreak.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.560]   It's remote support made easy.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   The pros use it.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.760]   And if you're a pro, you ought to have it in your toolkit.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:12.400]   I even think a few of us semi-pros use it all the time.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.200]   We thanks Citrix for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.840]   Adam Christensen is here from Mac.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.080]   We've got three of the biggest Mac podcasters in the world here.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   And then there's me.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.440]   Adam Christensen from MacCast.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440]   Great to have you.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.240]   Victor Caiao of the typical Mac user podcast.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   You focus on normal people.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.160]   Yeah, when you were talking about the other devices, I focused on the Mac.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.840]   I focus on people who are switching over.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.160]   People have been longtime users and forgot how to use some of this stuff.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.320]   I just go really deep into the core OS.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.640]   I very rarely talk about iPhones and iPads.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.000]   It's just not what I do.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.600]   There's plenty of people that are doing a great job.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:57.040]   So I focus on the basics and what you forgot, we'll probably cover.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.040]   That's it.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040]   Absolutely typical Mac user.com.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.040]   It's a great show.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.680]   And Victor's been doing it for a long time.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.960]   Also has been a great help to us here at the Twitter network for a long time.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.200]   You were editing this week in law.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   Gratas.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.160]   And I really appreciate you doing that.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.680]   I think we've taken that off of your hands, right?
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.680]   You did.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   But it was my pleasure doing it.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.640]   Anytime I can get in front of an audio waveform, I'm a happy man.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.480]   Where's your studio based?
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.000]   I'm in Corona, California.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   I know where it is.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   So do my do my day gig and just spend a lot of time with it.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.240]   What is your day gig?
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.240]   I work for a large telecom.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.480]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.480]   Uh huh.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.480]   Do you know what?
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.120]   I do sys admin stuff for processing of billing.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.040]   We take raw data from telephone switches and process those downstairs.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.040]   How interesting.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.360]   You'll be interested in this Verizon story then.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.520]   Verizon has to pay what was it?
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.560]   $90 million to its customers.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.720]   Now, unfortunately, there's 50 million customers.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.360]   So you're each going to get about 45.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.960]   But 90 millions a lot when you have from Verizon's point of view, they said that they
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.840]   over or they were, I don't know, convicted.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.200]   They were sued for over billing.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.600]   They are going to give back that money that customers are overcharged and their mobile
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.600]   phone bills.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.880]   This is exactly what Victor does due to built in software that accesses the network on its
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.880]   own.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.120]   Over the next two months, Verizon will notify it.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.040]   So actually it's 15 million customers are going to get money back.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.760]   So you each get three bucks.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.320]   No, six bucks.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.680]   Oh, even best bucks.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.880]   Many of the credits will be refund checks for $2.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.080]   Six dollars.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.160]   It costs, I have to say, and then you know this Victor, it costs for rising more than
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.960]   two bucks to print a $2 check.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   Oh yeah.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   Oh yeah.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.400]   Some of you get more company statement.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.680]   Statement says, and I don't know why I'm even doing this on a Mac show.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.360]   No Mac, nobody, nobody who uses an iPhone uses Verizon.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.200]   So forget about it.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   Forget about it.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.440]   Wasn't this supposed to be like a gloat topic?
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   Oh yeah, gloat.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.080]   I would gloat except AT&T screwed me the same way exactly.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.720]   So and I never got a refund.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.440]   How long it took them to figure this out?
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   Right?
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   Over the last few years.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   That was the telling part for me.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.800]   I'm like, really years?
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.680]   That was the only part I had an issue with.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:22.000]   When Andy and I were in China, we both bought bandwidth packages from AT&T.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.240]   And I'll do that again when I go to Paris in December and when I go to South America
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.920]   in February.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.880]   So I buy like, I buy the big one like 250 megabytes, which is expensive.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.520]   It was like a couple hundred bucks, which seems like an awful lot for not very much
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   data.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.160]   And I bought 100 megabytes.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.480]   I was monitoring it because I'm very carefully.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:46.680]   And I use the app that was, you know, the iPhone has in the settings.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.680]   And I was watching usage.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.480]   As soon as it got to 99.9 megabytes, I turned off all data.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.920]   I get home and I charge for 150 megabytes.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.680]   They charge me a lot of money for that extra 50.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.840]   Victor, I don't know which company you work for, but.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   Dude.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   Hopefully they hooked you up, man.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.360]   Well, you know, actually they sort of hooked me up.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.640]   So I called them and I said, what the what the what the what the?
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.680]   And he said, well, here's what we're going to do.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.360]   And you know, he's no, you're in trouble with it.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.200]   Here's what we're going to do.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.920]   We're going to extend for another month the data, the $100 data thing.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   And that'll cover most of it.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.040]   And then we'll also a little more.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.680]   So instead of costing $100, it cost me $225.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.320]   But I felt and I felt happy.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.600]   I was really, but the advice that they give and I think this is good advice.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.440]   First of all, there is an AT&T app.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.560]   AT&T is my wireless app.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:48.760]   You should use that instead of the iPhones built in stuff and keep it for two months
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:54.240]   because apparently when you're overseas, a lot of times the extra data billing takes
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   a while to come in.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.800]   And if you if you if you cancel it right after you get back, it won't cover additional stuff
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   in the second month.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.000]   Dan, please turn it off.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.080]   If you're not going to buy an app like that, my God, just don't go overseas and, you know,
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.880]   come home to a $500, $600 bill.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.640]   It can happen so fast.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.360]   And just because Verizon has given you back your $6, don't expect it again.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.000]   It happened again, buddy boy.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.840]   The Verizon story sounded to me like the plot of a Mike Judge movie.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.840]   Edie Ocrissant.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.840]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.840]   Office space.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   Didn't he do office space?
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.400]   You know, because they're believing the hardware, right?
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.440]   They're saying that there was the problem was in the phone or the software in the phone.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.200]   So like some engineer just went, you know, we'll just shovel some pennies over here.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.680]   And then it's a rounding error.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.600]   $90 million later.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.120]   So what's all this about I add?
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.800]   We talked about a couple of weeks ago, maybe a couple of months ago now, the fact that Steve
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:56.520]   and Apple were keeping a very tight rain on the creative side of I add.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.360]   And understandably so, they don't want, you know, jumping, you know, punch the monkey
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.360]   ads on the bottom of iPhone apps.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:12.160]   But according to business insider, Adidas, which planned to buy I ads, dropped its plans,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.520]   costing Apple $10 million.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:20.680]   And the reason again, this is a story in business insider, Apple's demand for near total control.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.440]   And the bigger problem, it appears is that it wasn't so much that Adidas wanted a
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:33.360]   punch the monkey sort of ad, but so much as it's almost as if they had to pitch an idea
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.320]   to Apple the same way they had a pitch ideas to Adidas.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   That's absurd.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.400]   What the point is going to be what the content is going to be.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.560]   I've talked to one person who's been in the ad game for about traditional ad game for
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.720]   about 12 years and said that this sort of thing isn't completely unusual, especially
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.640]   when you're dealing with a pricey magazine, for instance, or very, very hyper-fungible.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.640]   Like the Oscars, they don't just sell somebody 30 seconds of airtime.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.480]   You have to make sure that they will want to know exactly what sort of stuff you're
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.480]   putting in there.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.440]   So this isn't necessarily a very weird thing to do.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.240]   Unfortunately, though, and this is his opinion, that if you're trying to build a brand new
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.320]   ad system, you really want to err on the side of really making sure that the creative people
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.280]   in the ad industry don't feel as though you're making it hard for them to give you their
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.280]   money.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.600]   And that's the sort of vibe that people are getting right now with Iads.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.920]   You don't want the situation that Andy Stamburg ran into on Saturday Night Live.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   Should I play this?
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.680]   I know if I play this, we can't be on YouTube because YouTube has that.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.720]   My belief is this is a perfect example of fair use.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.440]   It would suck because we make so much money off of YouTube.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:53.800]   Actually, you say that, Andrew, but some of the shows get 8 or 9,000 views on YouTube
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.480]   that is not an insignificant amount of money.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   So if a show is pulled off of YouTube, it's going to, I'll do the math.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:08.040]   It'll cost me a thousand or so dollars if those people at YouTube pull this off.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.080]   But I don't care because I'm not in it for the money, as you all know.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.760]   I'm in it for the lowest.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.320]   Let's take a vote for the panel.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.600]   There are like four of us here.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.640]   What if we convince you not to do that and we each get $333?
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.160]   This is why I like Andy.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.800]   Oh, come on.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:33.480]   You're going to, if it's for the viewers and the list for the people, it's for the kids.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   It's for the kids.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.800]   It's just a, so I'll just play a little bit of it, but it's a, well, actually I can't
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.320]   because it's going to have a big ad if it's a Hulu thing.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   So I'll just turn the audio off right now and I don't have any Hulu ad going on.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.400]   Oh, it's brought to you by Windows Internet Explorer 9 beta.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.440]   You can't get it on Macintosh nor should you.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.160]   Here we go.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.360]   So Andy is in bed.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   I love Andy Samberg.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.080]   By the way, it looks as somebody pointed out, was it you, Andy Enoco, he looks exactly
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   like Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.080]   It's not me, unfortunately.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   No, I think that was me.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.080]   It was me.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.080]   Victor.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.400]   He should have played Zuckerberg in the movie.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.040]   So the burglars are breaking in.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   He's got his iPhone.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.040]   He's making a call.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.320]   He's under the bed, but it's too noisy.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:26.280]   So he mutes 911, but fortunately, because he has an iPhone, there's an app for that.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:31.680]   He opens up the 911 app on his iPhone.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.600]   But this is what happens if Apple doesn't keep tight control of advertising.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:44.360]   He's getting a big old ad with Helen Mirren.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.560]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.560]   Good in anything.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.760]   She's like the female Gene Hackman.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.760]   She's fan.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   Yes, exactly.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.760]   Yes.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   Yes.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.760]   What is the nature of your emergency?
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   Home invasion.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.760]   Where do you think he's entering?
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.760]   And he's entering in the GPS.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.840]   Please select your theater for rescue dogs.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:09.360]   He ends up buying 99 kids tickets for rescue dogs 3D.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.280]   Thank you for your purchase.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:17.080]   And then it goes through his contact list and mails every one of the people in his contact
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.400]   list and fighting them to join him.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.240]   Now that is kind of what Apple's trying to avoid, right?
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   Absolutely.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:29.560]   I mean, nobody's going to do that on an iPhone, but I mean, some of them are.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.560]   Some of them are.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.640]   You open some apps and that is the experience.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.360]   I think that's the parody there.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.920]   The thing about what Apple is doing, I think it's similar to what they did with the really
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.120]   tight initial controls on apps, on the app store.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.240]   And you've seen now they've kind of opened it up.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.720]   But I think they're launching the new ad platform.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:55.360]   And from Apple's perspective, they want these things to be a real showcase for what the platform
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.560]   can do and what they can be.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.080]   So they're really controlling it.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.560]   And fortunately, I worked at an ad agency up in Portland for five or six years.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.600]   And one of the worst things you can do to a creative is tell them that you don't agree
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.360]   with their creative concepts.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.760]   I mean, it doesn't make that relationship really good, but they have the same problem
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.480]   with app developers early on too, right?
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:20.360]   So I think they want it really to be exactly how they want it to be.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.280]   And they're going to work with certain agencies that will work with them.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.600]   And ultimately, though, they are going to have to open it up.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.640]   They're not going to be able to continue to do that, especially with other ad platforms
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:33.280]   out there like AdMob and they still have to compete at the end of the day.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.840]   According to one of the sources for this business insider story, Adidas decided to
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.800]   cancel its ads after Apple rejected its creative concept for the third time.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:52.000]   And Apple rep did not comment but has not denied that Adidas pulled out of the iAd program.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.520]   Adidas declined to comment on quote rumors or speculations and quote, and refused, but
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.000]   refused to deny the story.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.440]   So I think it's the case that, and rep did email quote, "We explore all mobile channels
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.920]   that will help us tell our brand and product stories.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.720]   Naturally, iAd is one of them.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   Mobile is an important part of our media strategy and the success of our my coach application
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.120]   for iPhone and Blackberry shows that we are on a good way in."
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:26.640]   Well, apparently not an English speaker who wrote this, but I think Adidas is going to
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.520]   be careful about pissing off Apple as we all should be.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.840]   I've learned my lesson, Steve, and I'm sorry.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:38.720]   I'm not really sure that's true because this is just an experimental ad platform.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.480]   If advertisers are really just concerned about getting eyeballs in front of the message,
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:49.840]   they know that it's inevitable that Android devices will get more attention and more eyeballs
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.840]   than iPhone users only because you've got so many different carriers and so many different
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.960]   manufacturers making so many more devices.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:01.640]   I think that it's going to be like getting an ad into Vogue or getting an ad on the Oscars
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:06.720]   where people who want to get a certain kind of extremely valuable consumer are going to
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.800]   get frozen out.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.320]   But I think that Adidas probably just said, "You know what?
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.840]   This is not worth this much trouble for an ad that we're not even sure what kind of return
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.840]   we're going to get on it.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:22.440]   It's going to come down to the first round of high profile ads come back and they can
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:27.120]   figure out exactly what kind of response they got compared to what response they got on
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.280]   the cheap $49 Moda phone that people got for free with contract.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.560]   That's when people are going to realize that, "Okay, maybe it's not quite so much trouble
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.560]   going through as we thought," just like we thought that, "Okay, if it's a thousand
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.080]   bucks to do not do this, maybe we will.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.960]   We will do what YouTube asks us to do just to stick our hand in the till."
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.040]   It really feels like the app process.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   I mean, it's the same thing.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.680]   I would hope that Apple is providing the ad aid and see some guidelines as to what is
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:01.440]   needed, what they can do differently to have the most impact based on what Apple knows,
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.440]   which is also limited.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.080]   So one would hope that that's happening and they're trying to do some hand holding here
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.560]   to have their launch be successful as things start out.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.440]   They don't want the fart app equivalent on ads.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.920]   I think Apple is trying to prevent some of that by working with them, but then it comes
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.920]   down like Adam said, there's eagles.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.880]   I mean, ad men and women are not known to be soft people who take direction.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.880]   They give direction.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.160]   We don't take direction.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.320]   We give it.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.080]   Well, and Android does seem to be coming on strong.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.160]   Now we keep hearing stories.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.600]   This is another one from Nielsen this time.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:43.720]   Google's Android software has become, according to Bloomberg, the most popular operating system
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.480]   in the US amongst news.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:53.600]   Well, see again, wiggle words among new smartphone buyers bypassing the iPhone and Blackberry
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   platform.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:01.400]   Android was the top choice for US consumers who bought a smartphone in the last six months.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.040]   So it's not taking it.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.240]   And this is what Apple said when they had the conference, they were taking into account
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:13.520]   all owners, but the trend is clearly in the favor of Android.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.560]   Which in motions, Blackberry and Apple's iPhone tied for second place, according to
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.560]   net Nielsen.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.040]   Yeah, it's interesting to see what's going to be happening to Blackberry.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:27.840]   I might have a briefing with representatives of a very, a very major carrier.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   And it was one of those.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.080]   It wasn't really a Hey, here's this new phone that we're going to be getting.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.160]   It really was sort of Hey, we're in town.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.120]   We want to talk to you on background about all kinds of different things.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.320]   You can basically see you can figure out what our car is about.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.960]   And the conversation turned to Blackberry.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.360]   And it really came down to that expression on their face, that tone in their voice that
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.120]   said that, of course, we can't say that Blackberry is dull as dishwater and it's not a big part
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.800]   of our business right now.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.360]   But that's pretty much the situation.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.280]   And if you want us to talk about Blackberry, I suppose we could say a few things, but there
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.600]   really is nothing going on there.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.240]   It's these these number of things are going to be less and less significant.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:08.000]   Because once again, the popularity of Android is just going to be the two things.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.320]   One thing that doesn't matter doesn't concern Apple at all, another thing that is Apple's
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.880]   problem, one being just like I said, just sheer numbers and sheer number of manufacturers
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.880]   and carriers.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.560]   But another thing is going to be that if you go into the store looking for an iPhone that
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.520]   has a certain feature that the iPhone lacks, you have no place else to go.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:31.240]   And if for some people for years, if a if a rear facing, a front facing camera was a
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.680]   deal breaker, then that was the deal broken.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.880]   There's so much diversity among Android handsets right now that if you want a mechanical keyboard,
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.600]   you can get them a mechanical keyboard.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.480]   If you want a huge screen, you can get a huge screen.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.880]   If you want a kickstand, you can get a kickstand because there's so many different models
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   out there.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:52.400]   Apparently, AT&T, which sells a Blackberry torch and of course the iPhone, has three new Android
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.160]   phones today alone.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.360]   So there you see it.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.920]   What about this playbook?
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.400]   You got anybody has any thoughts about the new?
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.880]   We talked, I think we talked about it last week.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.040]   It's really vaporware.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.680]   Nobody in the press could hold it.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.160]   It wasn't a, you know, we don't even know if it was a working prototype.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:17.720]   It was just, it's a nice video, but it's clearly a rims reminder that Apple doesn't, isn't
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.080]   the only one in this space.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.080]   Is that right, Andy?
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   Is that what you?
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.080]   I really think that's what it was.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:27.920]   This is sort of like remember when the first Apple TV was snuck, the Apple decided to sneak
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.880]   release it, sneak preview it, but not release it for several months.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.880]   And coincidentally, they decided to do that around September or October when other people
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.320]   were considering buying things that would compete with the Apple TV.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.280]   This, so this smelled, this reeked every frame of it of, we realized that a lot of you are
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.240]   going to be buying each other iPads for Christmas.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.880]   Please don't buy each other iPads for Christmas because we might have some cool stuff coming
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.880]   out.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.880]   We can't tell you how much it's going to cost.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.760]   We can't tell you when we're actually going to ship it, but we managed to pay a guy to
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.520]   produce a really cool video of people in public parks holding something that you can pretend
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.440]   is our new tablet device.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.840]   So that's really what it's all about.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.600]   They got, they got a couple interesting things going on.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   They use the same sort of vibe that HP use, which is here's a company, here's a small
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.520]   software company with an interesting touch.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   Oh, operating system, let's just buy these guys and make that the cornerstone of our device.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.600]   They're also doing something really cool in that they're deciding to make it a Wi-Fi-only
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   device.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.120]   They'll make it very competitive with most of the other tablets that I've seen out there,
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:30.760]   which aren't even trying to address the iPad 3G's ability to just spend $130 just for the
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.200]   3G chipset.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.240]   And if you never want to pay for 3G ever in the future, you can do that.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.920]   If you never want to have a contract, that's okay too.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.880]   So this is a way for them to sort of directly compete with the iPad in a way that Samsung
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.720]   and the rest of them might not be able to do, but it really is vapor at this point.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.880]   It's almost just a mission statement, right?
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.240]   If we were going to build something, we would have a front-facing and back-facing camera.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.600]   We would only have Wi-Fi.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.400]   You know, I mean, it's because it's your drunk friend when you're driving him back from
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.400]   the tires store.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   Oh, he ought to do.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.120]   His band totally should have rocked, but unfortunately, Defleppard got there with their album first.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.400]   They booked this good studio at school.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.400]   You know.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.560]   Well, in the meantime, Apple's making this device available everywhere.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.960]   You know, that's how they're finally--
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.680]   Target on Sunday, right?
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.480]   Now we can buy iPads at Target.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.480]   Go ahead.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.400]   I'm just saying that what a great way to fight this.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.880]   Not only don't they have one to show anybody, but now it's like, you know, the iPad's going
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.320]   to be like Riggly's gum pretty soon.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:33.560]   I'm going to go to Denny's and be able to pick one on the counter.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:34.560]   Can anybody compete?
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   I mean, the iPad now is according to Bloomberg.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:43.120]   Actually it's Bloomberg quoting Bernstein research.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:50.120]   The fastest, the most quickly adopted non-phone electronic product.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.720]   There's those words again.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   Phone.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.120]   What would the phone be?
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.720]   It's like delicious fudge.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.720]   Long sale.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.960]   Well, but the sales are pretty impressive.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:02.960]   Y'all.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:09.760]   One million iPhones sold in the first quarter.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:15.120]   And 4.5 million iPads sold in the first quarter.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.680]   The DVD player in its first year sold 350,000 units.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.160]   And that's what they're comparing it to.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.840]   Yeah, that's not comparable because you're not going to buy a DVD player unless you've
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.680]   got titles and then we're no titles available for a few weeks.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   That's not a good example.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.680]   Right.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.920]   And then we're going to get a half million sold in the first quarter.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:33.240]   They're doing about a one and a half million a month still.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:39.080]   It is a bigger even than I thought.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:43.480]   I mean, we were very bullish about the iPad having seen it in January.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.640]   And even before it came out, I made a bet with John C. Devorak and somebody in the chat
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.040]   room, oh, for sure it'll sell 5 million a year.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.200]   And people were laughing at me.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.120]   They said, no, it won't sell 5 million.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.120]   5 million.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.120]   This thing.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.480]   This thing's already sold 5 million.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.600]   It's probably going to have sold 10 million by the time the years out.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.080]   The 12 months is out.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.480]   The barometer for me is people like my wife's peers and teachers and she says, you go into
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.720]   the teachers lounge now and they all have them.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.560]   And these are not geeks like us.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:16.320]   These are people who are working hard and need the device and they're using it in the
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.960]   classroom to great classroom.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.320]   And some of the applications are fantastic done.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.880]   They're getting it.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.800]   I think the most significant thing is that now that all these other manufacturers are starting
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.000]   to show their cards, not one of them.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.560]   There's only one that I know of that is firmly building a tablet that is designed to be a
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.080]   real alternative to an iPad.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.760]   Everybody else is decided to back the seven inch screen only because it means that they're
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.960]   not competing as directly with the tenant screen of the iPad.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   That is huge.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:48.560]   If any of these companies saw any vulnerability in the iPad, they would be going after it.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   You're straight after.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.800]   No, but he's going straight after.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:57.080]   Actually, I think Bloomberg kind of buried the lead here because the analyst from Bernstein
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:01.880]   goes on to say he covers Best Buy, the first major retailer to sell the iPad.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.480]   Chris Target is going to start selling it as we said.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:10.080]   His analysis found that not only are iPads, now this is what the Best Buy Chairman said
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.880]   and then retracted.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.040]   Well, the analysts are agreeing with it.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:19.720]   Not only are iPads cannibalizing the netbook notebook category at Best Buy, they could also
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   be hurting sales of TVs and digital cameras because it's a man.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.240]   Granahan from Bernstein says it's a rare American household that would spend 600 plus
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:35.240]   dollars on an iPad and then go on and buy a TV or a PC or digital camera the same month
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.120]   or the same quarter or even the same year.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:44.000]   So you just got me imagine like a living room with this big white wall with a little
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   iPad.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   You got a light pack, baby.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.640]   What more do you want daddy daddy left home with the $750 for the big flat screen.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.040]   I just got sort of memorized by the racing game and sorry honey.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.520]   I'm going to be watching this.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:04.480]   Now Goldman Sachs downgraded Microsoft and really hurting Microsoft stock price today
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:11.440]   saying quote the company Microsoft needs a credible iPad answer in the near term to
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:17.880]   allay concerns that tablet proliferation necessarily cannibalizes Windows sales.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:24.840]   This thing is not only doing well in and of itself, it's killing other markets.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.960]   Yeah, I think that's a bit overreaching don't you?
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.000]   Yeah, I felt kind of the same same way.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:37.200]   I think what it does is it does maybe delay a purchase or supplement a purchase.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.640]   I think those things are still going to happen.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.680]   They're just not happening as frequently.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.440]   So you might not run out and get that brand new laptop right away because the iPads beating
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.720]   a lot of your web browsing and your email and your other kind of needs.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.480]   You could say they might buy a TV or might buy a camera later.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:57.040]   But really if the iPad does what you know the sweet middle wants a netbook or a notebook
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.640]   to do, they're not going to buy one then.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   Right?
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.920]   Yeah, I think it's more of a case of people came in looking for a device that would fill
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.640]   a very specific list of tasks.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.080]   They would not up until last year they could not find that exact device so they would walk
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.080]   out with a netbook.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.080]   Right.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.680]   So it's not as though there really is two identical devices that they have a free choice of.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.480]   It's that the iPad and the slates are going to come after it are exactly the sort of thing
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.360]   that a lot of people were looking for.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:30.320]   There's some speculation that Apple or Microsoft which has its big Windows Phone 7 announcement
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:36.400]   coming up in a week might at that time also announce some Windows based slates.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.400]   Like who cares?
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.400]   Come on guys.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.840]   They've been trying this for 10 years.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.840]   Give me a break.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.720]   That's not going to do it.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.200]   And to the credit they're having some success in tablets.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   Oh really?
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:53.360]   The thing is you don't see people using tablets on the subway to read books and to surf the
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.520]   web.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:49:00.800]   But when you see people, it's mostly for vertical markets where when you need a very powerful,
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:04.400]   very versatile tablet computer for medical applications, it's probably running Windows
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   underneath.
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:10.000]   When you need somebody to run Windows software that will run a lighting rig or very, very
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.160]   complicated stage rig, the grips and the lighting designers are using are controlling and adjusting
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.160]   the lights with Windows tablets.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.720]   So it's not that it's been a failure.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.880]   It's just that they really never managed to get these things to catch on in the public
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:23.880]   consciousness.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.840]   And they've certainly never been in a situation where someone can't simply walk into a store
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.280]   with the intention of buying a Windows tablet and walk out with exactly what they came for.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:36.520]   The iPad is just yet another Apple consumer phenomenon and Microsoft has not had one of
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.520]   those.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.240]   I'm actually starting to think back.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.360]   I don't think they have ever had a situation like that where they have the...
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   Oh, sorry.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   Okay.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   Good.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.360]   Xbox.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.840]   With the exception of the Xbox is probably the only software device they've ever had that
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:55.480]   has become a real phenomenon where people just love it and they evangelize to other people.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.880]   And there's a chance you won't be able to get the one that you want.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.880]   Right.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.360]   Well, the transformative piece for me seems that people are using smartphones more than
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   ever.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.240]   And when they're doing that now, it's so easy to make that leap into the iPad because they
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.960]   know the operating system.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.120]   It's easy for them to use it.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.800]   And so that to me is the bigger story is that we've seen a tremendous jump in the amount
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.280]   of people, at least that I see in the streets that are now using smartphones, iPhones and
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.200]   others all the time.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.160]   So I think this really leads credence to the people, the way that people are computing
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.880]   now is more in the hand than everywhere else.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.080]   And it's become just the alternative.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   This is...
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.400]   I need it with me all the time.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.920]   One of these two devices.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:41.920]   And the other thing that amazes me about the iPad is it adapts to...
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.040]   It's this weird phenomenon.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:47.880]   It's this device that I have that adapts to be what I need it to be when I need it to
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.960]   be a certain thing.
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:54.000]   So great example is Victor, we were coming down and I'm checking email or surfing email,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.160]   keeping up on Twitter.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:59.280]   But then something came across and I wanted to post to my blog and boom, I was able to
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:03.840]   post to my blog that got home that evening and I wanted to watch some Netflix.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.080]   Well, now it's a TV and I'm watching my TV shows.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.200]   So it's like that thing that I always have with me.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.840]   It's the right size screen and it's adapting to what I need it to be at any given moment.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.200]   And I think a lot of people buy it for one reason thinking I'm going to use it for this
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.040]   and then suddenly discover, "Oh man, this really thing is really great at playing games,
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.040]   too.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:29.120]   Maybe I don't need that PSP or that Nintendo that I was thinking about buying."
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.480]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.920]   This is great having you.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.720]   Adam Christensen is here from MacCast.com.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.720]   Victor, "Kaiyo."
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:41.040]   I'm sorry, Victor, you get this all the time.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   Is it Portuguese?
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.040]   "Kaiyo."
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.040]   "Kaiyo."
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.040]   Cuban.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.040]   Cuban.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.280]   But I think the relatives visited Portugal at some time.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.440]   We're going to Cuba, you and me, buddy.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   Let's do it.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   I'm ready.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:58.040]   Before it turns into Orlando West or East, we're going.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.680]   And you know we're in the same place and that will turn into that if we don't be careful.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.320]   So yeah, I can't wait as a photographer.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.840]   My other podcast is photography.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.840]   So that'd be perfect.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.680]   Adam, does MacCast has been...
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.240]   I think this is the...
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.520]   Is it the oldest Macintosh podcast?
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.320]   One of the oldest Macintosh podcasts.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.320]   One of the oldest.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:18.520]   I don't know if I can claim oldest because I think there were a couple shows out there
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.520]   right before I started.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.520]   Older than us anyway.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.560]   You've been doing it for five and a half years.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.160]   I'm going strong so much so that you gave up your day job.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.160]   I did.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.160]   I went full time.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.240]   I launched a new membership program.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.800]   So we're doing subscription service, some premium content that people can pay for.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.280]   And it's working out really well.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   So happy for you.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.280]   That's so great.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.000]   Although, I wish I can't get free Nick's software anymore.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   So that's...
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.400]   No, I don't work for Nick anymore.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.520]   But they're doing great things too.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.240]   They just launched a new HDR product.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.480]   I know that they're really proud of.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.880]   And it's got their UPoint technology and stuff built in there.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.080]   So they're doing great without me.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.520]   No, they're not.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.520]   No one's doing great.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.520]   Well, the website might be hurting a little bit.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.520]   I don't know.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.520]   No, they hired some good guys that I actually know and they're great.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.600]   We're going to have more in just a second.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.840]   We have lots more to talk about, including our picks of the week coming up in just a bit
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.840]   before I do that though.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.960]   I want to talk a little bit about squarespace.com.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:15.680]   Life is so easy in a Squarespace as the pundit once said.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.560]   Squarespace is the easy way to make your very own website.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:24.400]   They like to say it's the place where exceptional websites begin.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:28.960]   The secret behind exceptional websites, I have to agree, our inside Twitter blog is
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.960]   on Squarespace.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   I'm moving my way.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.960]   I still...
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.400]   I keep saying this every week and I'm just really slow to do it.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.560]   I'm moving my radio show over there.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.040]   I love Squarespace.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.840]   Starting at $12 a month now, it's hosting and software.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:44.640]   The nice thing about having them do the hosting and software is it's always up to date.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.480]   You don't have to worry about security patches.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.240]   You don't have to think about all of that stuff.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.840]   It just works.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:57.720]   They have great templates to make your site look unique unlike any other Squarespace site
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.960]   that you never run out of bandwidth.
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.800]   That's one of the beauties of Squarespace.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:07.080]   You can be dug/dotted and tweeted all at the same time.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.560]   Squarespace just goes, "Yeah, bring it on.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:11.280]   Give me more."
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.160]   Monthly, yearly and two yearly packages, but I'll tell you what, if you use the promo
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:18.760]   code MACBRAKE, you're going to save 10% off for the life of your site.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.920]   But I don't want you to do Squarespace without trying it first.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.000]   With all our sponsors, well, all of them except for it, we haven't figured out a way
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.880]   to get you a free Ford for a month.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:32.720]   With all of our sponsors except for it, we give you a free trial because I want you to
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.720]   try before you buy it.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.320]   Go to squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.640]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.800]   Just three seconds and you've got a site going.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:46.360]   For free, you can try it for two weeks.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   This is it.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   You name the site.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:53.960]   You give a password, an email address, and you enter in the letters from the capture,
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.960]   and you're done.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.960]   You've got a site.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.960]   That's it.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.960]   You've got a site.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.720]   There's no commitment, no credit card required.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.160]   One of the nice things about Squarespace is they've got this great importer.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:07.240]   They'll take your existing blog and comments and put it in there.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.720]   You really can play with it, play with the design, and see what it would look like to
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.680]   have a fully functioning site based on Squarespace.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.760]   I think you'll like it a lot.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:21.040]   If you decide to buy, use the promo code MACBRAKE 10% off any of the packages for the life
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.200]   of your site.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.160]   Squarespace.com.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.040]   I know so many people who are using Squarespace now.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.840]   It really gives you the capability of doing a great site.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:36.560]   Adam Christensen, notwithstanding, we do need our designers.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:42.520]   But frankly, you don't have to be a designer to do a site that just looks great.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.240]   Squarespace.com/MacBreak.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:48.000]   Oh, I got to turn up the jingle.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.400]   ♪ Life is so easy in a square space ♪
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.840]   I like to play that because it just makes me feel nice.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.840]   What do you...
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.840]   I...
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:58.840]   It makes me feel high.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:59.840]   Yes.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.640]   It's got to be 420 somewhere, man.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.640]   Yeah, man.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.640]   Just checking the clock.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   Did.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.640]   I want to go to mentee.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   Did.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.040]   Back to the news.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.840]   This was a really great week for...
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:18.800]   My phone is ringing.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.160]   It sounds like Google.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.360]   Google's calling me.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:32.480]   This is a great week for iPhone and iPad stories, but there are some other stories in here.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.000]   Google TV, we should mention, is going to be...
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.200]   I think it's really going to go public this week.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.520]   Logitech has a big announcement tomorrow, which we will be covering.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   Yeah, and of course, they were really, really...
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:53.320]   They really made sure that they got out a very, very long press release yesterday.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.120]   Explaining about how many goodness, gracious...
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.520]   It's like the last month out of three.
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.000]   Oh, we've had to bring chairs in from the neighbors.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.720]   We've had so many gentlemen callers trying to get through.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.080]   You want to give us more content.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   It's like...
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.080]   Well, listen to what they got.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:10.040]   And this is something that's not on Apple TV.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.720]   We'll talk about the Apple TV in a second.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.800]   The Google TV service will have content partnerships with HBO.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:16.800]   That's pretty big.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.800]   Okay, big deal.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.320]   That means that the streaming service that they've had for years...
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.760]   Excuse me, a year and a half now is also going to be compatible with Google TV.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:25.760]   Big deal.
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.760]   Move on.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:27.760]   Really?
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.680]   Could you watch HBO stuff streaming from HBO's website?
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.600]   If you're an HBO subscriber, there is an HBO on demand service.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   It's not like...
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   It's not like...
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:41.640]   But with all these boxes, be it the Roku box, be it the Apple TV, be it Google TV, what
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:45.680]   you're hoping to see is something where NBC has decided that they're going to be selling
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.120]   the NBC channel through this device.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.120]   Right.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.840]   And do something that is not available anywhere else.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:51.840]   As opposed to...
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:55.480]   Supposedly what this is, it says HBO Go is what they're going to call it.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:01.280]   An on demand portal for HBO subscribers separate from whatever on demand offerings available
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.640]   through one's cable provider.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.520]   So what's unclear is, do I have to subscribe through my cable company?
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.520]   Or can I subscribe directly to HBO?
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.520]   That would be...
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:10.520]   Would you agree, Andy?
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:16.320]   If I can go to HBO directly and subscribe, that would be a big deal.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:21.000]   If it would be a very big deal, if this is something that is only available on Google
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:27.840]   TV, not only that, if it were an exclusive to Google TV for the foreseeable future.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:28.840]   It won't be, of course.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:29.840]   Because even...
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.840]   HBO's not going to give Google anything like that.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.880]   CNBC, big deal, you can get that anywhere.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.800]   Turner broadcasting, same thing.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:38.800]   NBA.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:42.280]   Okay, but when you look through this list, especially...
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.680]   I'm looking directly at their own site.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.000]   This is not like third party commentary.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.120]   I'm looking directly at the site.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.200]   And they're saying they've got four bullet items that we're saying.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.040]   Turner broadcasting has been hard to work.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.920]   Optimizing some of their most popular websites.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:00.320]   And so the translation there is that the web page that you can...
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:04.760]   That's available from any web browser will also be available on Google TV.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.560]   NBCUniversal says they're collaborating to bring CNBC real time.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:10.560]   Okay, big deal.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:14.640]   This is something you can get stock prices on the TV screen while you're watching CNBC.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.320]   Nice, but not great.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.960]   HBO, I need to refresh my knowledge on HBO Go.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:26.420]   My recollection of it is that it's kind of like our device does Netflix just like other
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.160]   devices have done and will do Netflix.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:35.520]   NBA Game Time, that is a big deal because that's exactly the sort of thing that a TV integrated
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.520]   web device should be doing extremely well.
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.720]   Just like an MLB at bat.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.680]   If that app were to make an appearance on Apple TV, that would be a very significant
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.680]   thing.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.280]   But so essentially all they've done is they built one of these apps so that it's available
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.640]   through Android, through Android.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.400]   Because unlike the Apple TV, this does have apps.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   It will run now.
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.840]   It will run apps the way that every single Android device will run pretty much any Android
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.080]   app.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:08.280]   During the demo, when they unveiled it during the Google I/O developer conference, they
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.520]   were showing Pandora running on it and it looked like it had been, it was just the standard
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.120]   Pandora app that was super stretched and didn't really fill the screen.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.120]   That would be bad.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.680]   Well, it's not necessarily bad.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.480]   My beef with Apple is usually that I would like to have the choice of having a bad user
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.640]   experience if it's the difference between running Pandora.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.640]   Right.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.560]   But it depends on whether Google can really leverage that.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:36.320]   I had my Apple briefing on the Apple TV recently.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.040]   And of course, I had to ask them a question about iOS and of course they couldn't tell
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:45.360]   me anything about future apps that may or may not ever appear on this device.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.240]   But I think that if Apple really wants to compete with Google TV, they're going to have
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:54.400]   to open up the secret chest and start talking about how this is an iOS device.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.600]   It runs apps.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.000]   The app development process is exactly the same as it is for any other device that we
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   make.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.720]   And at some point in the near future, there is going to be the ability to have the third
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.680]   party apps installed on this device.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.640]   If they decide to simply sit in their hands for a while, that's something that Google
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.840]   TV could exceptionally exploit.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.440]   And it's definitely a weakness that Apple needs.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.680]   It's a when I'm getting at it.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.400]   It's kind of a silly weakness where if they do have plans to make this box available for
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:32.360]   third party apps, they really should start to at least hint towards that right now rather
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.720]   than make sure that anybody who has a hundred bucks, a hundred fifty bucks, 200 bucks in
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:40.920]   their pocket, you want them to go buy the Apple TV today for Christmas instead of buying
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.760]   the Logitech box today for Christmas.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.000]   Yeah, because that's the competition, right?
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.480]   The, according to Gizmodo, an iPhone developer, Stephen Trout and Smith has installed apps
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.480]   on this Apple TV.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:57.200]   Because it's got a gigs of storage on there for reasons no one understands and it has
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.200]   a USB port.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.080]   There's only one little problem.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.280]   You can't launch them.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.280]   But they're on there.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.560]   Get on there.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.720]   It needs a launcher.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.640]   Yeah, that's that's inevitable.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640]   I mean, I'm so great.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.840]   Well, jail breakers are probably do it, right?
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.480]   Well, yeah, I mean, so it's, it's, it's, it was a one day before the thing was jail
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.480]   broken.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.640]   And now we have a confirmation that apps have been launched on it.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.280]   And so if it takes, it won't take long because everybody wants to be the first to break the
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.760]   speed of sound and everyone's going to be trying to get third party, especially iPhone
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.520]   apps launched and running on this.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.520]   Right.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.400]   I don't know why would be Goldberg just appeared.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.160]   I was, I don't know what this is.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160]   It's random video.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.000]   It's a photo.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   It's not, it's not.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   It's not.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   Oh, it's an ad for his photo.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   It took me to.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.400]   It looks like it's a yeah.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.880]   Well, boy, they totally tricked me.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.760]   It looks like this is going to be having something to do with the article that it's
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.680]   about how much exposure they got by leaking the, the iPhone four.
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.680]   Oh, thank you.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680]   Got.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680]   They leaked the iPhone four.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.680]   Wow.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680]   Oh my God.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680]   Well, you know, they got around.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.680]   I'm just, I'm just amazed that like today you go and that's stepped on every single page
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.040]   a link to the video story about leaking the iPhone four is even Woodward and Bernstein,
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.800]   they moved on after the story was over.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   Right.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   We got the iPhone for now.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.760]   We don't really need the, you know, if we keep harping on about Nixon, we're going to
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.760]   look like idiots.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.160]   But that I would not have ended up.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.640]   Page in a while.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.400]   The thing I'm wondering about on, on apps on the Apple TV and I've been thinking that,
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.880]   you know, and I agree with you, Andy, I think they need to start letting us know so that
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.880]   doesn't happen this Christmas that people go out and get another device or wait for
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.880]   something else.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.920]   But I have to imagine that we're going to see Pandora and ABC that I think Apple is going
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.040]   to selectively put apps on there.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.040]   I'm curious if they'll actually open it up completely like they've done the other iOS
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.040]   iOS platforms.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.360]   It's already a big deal.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:58.800]   If all the, if the only advantage of having iOS on this device is that Pandora, Hulu and
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.800]   all these Netflix, sorry, Netflix is a separate issue, Hulu and all these other guys can
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.800]   simply say, you know how we spent two months developing this app for the iPhone?
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.960]   We can get this running on Apple TV in about one week.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.400]   That's already a pretty big advantage.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.360]   If third party is able to think of interesting ways in which they can use the Apple TV even
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360]   better.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.800]   That's the idea of running arbitrary apps in this device.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.040]   That's going to be the sort of thing that helps convince people to spend a hundred bucks
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.720]   in advice that they may not necessarily need.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.880]   I think we're going to learn a lot about what kind of a challenge Google TV is going to present
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.080]   tomorrow when we finally find out exactly how much this Logitech box is going to cost.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.640]   If it costs 99 bucks, that's going to be a really complicated decision for a lot of people.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.960]   If it costs 200 bucks, well, who cares?
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.960]   Really?
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.880]   So it's all about price point.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.800]   I really think so, because for a hundred bucks, people are going to be really receptive to
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:57.600]   all those bullet points that, well, if the right person wants to steer somebody towards
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:03.280]   a Google TV, they can say, well, look, meaning if you got your stuff in iTunes, great, you
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.840]   can stream stuff via iTunes.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.680]   And yeah, maybe you can get stuff from Apple specific content partners.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.360]   What Google is offering you, however, is the ability to access the entire web, including
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:18.600]   flash content through your TV, and all these tens of thousands of Android apps will all
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.080]   run on your device.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.280]   And really, all they're asking for is $109 versus $99.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.280]   And it will still stream Netflix.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.000]   So why is there a choice?
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.240]   If they're charging 200 bucks, they have to answer the question.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.680]   Am I going to be getting it?
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.680]   Exactly.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:36.480]   $99 was such an important price point because it's so psychological.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:41.240]   A lot of people are going to be thinking, I didn't necessarily need this, but I can imagine
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:45.480]   myself absorbing this cost very readily and getting more than $99 worth of value out
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.480]   of it.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.760]   Now, you were able to make a good case that, well, maybe all of these, this list of features
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:06:00.480]   that Google's expounding, which is a long list compared to iTunes and Netflix, is some
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.800]   of it smoking mirrors, but consumers aren't going to know that.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.760]   They're going to say, oh, look at that.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.440]   Look at all those things it does.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:13.200]   The second mistake that Apple has made is that they don't have AirPlay ready to go yet.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.400]   It requires the new iOS 4.2.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:23.080]   Once that's out, they can put the really great dog and pony demo of what this device can
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.880]   do and how it integrates with everything else you have in the house, everything else in
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.840]   the house has an Apple logo on it.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.440]   That's what they can really do.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.640]   That's what they can really do the Razzle-Dowel and show off why this is the best $99 thing
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.440]   you'd ever buy for some people.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.800]   Right now, Google already has the thing with it and say, oh, here's the video on my phone.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.960]   I don't want to watch it this small and fling.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:48.160]   Now it's on my 73-inch plasma screen display for all to enjoy and be wonder at.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.920]   AirPlay really is pretty ambitious.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.920]   There's things that we expect to see next month.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.360]   Immediately, we can be able to do things like you're on your iPad or on your iPhone and
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:04.240]   you're just someone on Twitter, links a YouTube video that's kind of interesting.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.800]   So you open up in Safari and you're watching it on your iPhone.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.840]   Right from Safari, you will be able to simply say, you know what?
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:14.080]   I want to actually watch this on my Apple TV right now and it will simply find it and
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.920]   send it over there.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:22.600]   Right now, built-in media players, the Apple's own media players, will support it in 4.2,
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.440]   the Safari, the movie player, the iPod app, the movie player app.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.720]   And Apple told me that in the future, third-party apps will have access to that functionality
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.720]   too.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.400]   But that's, again, something that's kind of generic.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.880]   I'm sorry, not generic.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.960]   It's kind of a vague thing that you can't really explain to a user.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.400]   You have to show it to them.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.880]   And I think at launch date, Google will have a lot more to show users that they can imagine
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.880]   themselves using.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880]   Right.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.200]   I think it's going to be about who can tell the story best here in the last quarter before
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.720]   Christmas as people have these decisions to make.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.440]   You know, you can bet those Apple ads around Apple TV are going to be ramping up and AirPlay
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.920]   and everything else because I think that's going to be the differentiator for not us
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.960]   geeks, but for the average consumer up there that is going to have to decide between two
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.040]   or three boxes, Roku, Apple, Google.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:12.160]   So it's like, who's going to tell this story best?
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:17.240]   And I think Apple has done a pretty good job with the integration of being able to say,
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.440]   you own an iPad or you own an iPhone.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.840]   And so that's going to be the story they have to tell.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:27.320]   I think Google's going to have to reach mass market in a different way than they do currently
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.320]   to be able to get the average consumer to say, yes, that's what I have to have because
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.960]   of all the things Andy said.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.520]   I agree with that completely.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:38.280]   If you already have an iPhone, if you already have an iPad and especially if you are there
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.040]   using iTunes to manage your library, you have to start with the decision, why would I not
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.520]   get the Apple TV and why would I get something else other than an Apple TV because it integrates
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.760]   so well and so sharply.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:55.880]   If you have never used Apple devices before, things get opened up a little wider.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.160]   The bottom line story is going to be that these are between Google TV and Apple TV.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.760]   There's two different devices with two different perspectives.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.280]   Apple TV seems to be centered around the idea that you have all of your content already.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.080]   Now we need different ways of getting access to it or getting links to things that are
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.080]   streaming.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.440]   Google TV is as you would imagine with a Google product, it's all about search.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:20.840]   Meaning I'm not going to be looking necessarily on a programming grid to find programming
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.840]   I want.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:28.000]   I'm just going to type Nash bridges or Cheech Marin and find wherever I can find it, wherever
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.920]   I can download it, wherever I can stream it or wherever it's on a DVR or in a program
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.920]   listing.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.800]   It's interesting.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.880]   Both these companies are still trying to figure out how to convince people that they
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.280]   want a computer that's hooked up to their TV set.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.920]   For now, I think that Apple is a little bit closer to what people want.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.920]   Google really is centered around the "You want a web browser on your TV set?"
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.640]   Yes, you want to surf the web sitting 15 or 20 feet away from the screen.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:58.360]   I'm not sure if that's...consumers are going to have to either prove or disprove that theory.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.360]   We like the Apple TV.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.120]   I tell you, as a podcaster, I like it.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.720]   Especially as a Twit podcast, because you turn it on and then feature podcasts right
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.880]   there in the pod.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880]   Twit!
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:12.040]   So, I mean, podcasts are given a nice position, I think, on this thing.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.840]   Yeah, it's so cool to just...
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.240]   Marco, you just search for podcasts in the iTunes library, not your iTunes library, but
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.920]   the iTunes library.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:26.360]   It has your favorite and suddenly Robert Luon's new electric car video podcast is now simply
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.400]   a show that you get to watch whenever it comes on.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.400]   Exactly.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.400]   I love that.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.400]   Wonderful.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.400]   Adam, you have one?
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.400]   You're using it?
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.400]   I love that I got it day one.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.240]   The thing that amazed me right out of the box was the out of box experience, other than
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:42.720]   the fact that they don't give you the HDMI cable, which they need to take care of in the
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.520]   Apple store.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:49.920]   But assuming you have the HDMI cable for hooking it up to your TV, it was plug-in, plug-in,
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.400]   and I'm accessing content.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.120]   I mean, it was literally that simple.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.840]   And you pointed out when you were in here on Sunday, like two bucks for an HDMI cable
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.480]   from Monoprice.com.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.320]   I went out to Fries and I had to really search out, you know, they had the monster cables
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.320]   in the big giant display and then you kind of went over and they had some of the Belkin
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.160]   and the $20 cables and then way down in the corner there was a six foot cable and I think
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.600]   I paid about $5 for mine.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.840]   But Monoprice had them for like a buck 36.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.520]   I think I ordered it at some point like a dozen HDMI cables for Monoprice because I just
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.880]   knew that this would be coming up and I have, you know, I just have a closet full of cables.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.520]   Do you think that part of the problem was that they just figured that we can either give
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:37.120]   everybody a free HDMI cable or we could make the box a little bit smaller?
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.120]   It's so compact.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:42.920]   In fact, I cannot get the power cord back in here because it's so tightly, perfectly
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.920]   round in here.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:45.920]   I have exactly the same problem.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:50.060]   I brought it with me up to Petaluma so I could show it to some people and I tried
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:53.040]   to wind that cable back in and it was hopeless.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.040]   It's like Pandora's box.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:00.680]   They, I bet you knowing Apple, they had Foxconn in Venom machine that would wrap this just
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.840]   so it would fit in this box.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.400]   If you're right, Andy, just so it would be that small.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.440]   So no room for a HDMI.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.200]   I'm going to New York on Thursday.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:13.840]   My room has like a big TV that has multiple inputs and now I'm thinking, why would maybe
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.040]   I should bring this little box with me just not because I'm going to use it, but just
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040]   because I can.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.040]   That's interesting.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.640]   People will carry around that you brought your Apple TV with you.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.640]   Adam did.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.880]   I had not been convinced to buy one and that was the use case that convinced me.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.560]   Adam brought it up with him and he's, and we said, we have a TV here.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560]   Let's plug it in.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:38.360]   Now we did run into some problems in that a lot of these hotel TVs are locked out so
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:41.840]   that you cannot put an HDMI input into them.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.520]   But Adam, take it over.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.080]   You did some Google flu and then we find you figured out.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080]   Yeah, we did.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080]   You did some research.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.680]   Seeing and found some, you know, that you can find how to, how to open up these things.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.160]   And even I think Victor, we ended up doing some social engineering because we just called
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.600]   down and said, look, we're working on a business presentation.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.160]   We're at a conference.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.320]   We need to show this thing and we need it opened up and they brought up the special green
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.320]   remote that access to the H2.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:10.600]   Was it a special suitcase that was like illuminated when you lift the lid to it?
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.600]   It was.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.600]   It was too many on the back.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.520]   He said it turns up at the same time.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.040]   The non-lockdown remote.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.960]   So where there's a will, there's a way.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   But you know, there's Wi-Fi.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.560]   The only other problem we ran into was that in order to get it on the Wi-Fi network, you
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.280]   have to have the Apple remote because the remote works over Wi-Fi.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.440]   The sharing works over Wi-Fi.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:37.080]   So I had accidentally forgot the remote and we're like, well, no problem.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.840]   We have the iPhone, the iPad app.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.160]   Well, guess what?
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.400]   We couldn't get the Apple TV on the Wi-Fi network.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.960]   Could you enter the.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   Right.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:48.400]   Because the remote works over Wi-Fi and everything works over.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.880]   So you have to get it up once you get it up on Wi-Fi.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.880]   Oh, I see.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.960]   You can't use the remote because it's on Wi-Fi network.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:54.960]   I get it.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.480]   Or if we had a physical ethernet connection, we could have probably done it too.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.360]   You know, because it does have ethernet on the back.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.360]   I do like the new remote.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.960]   I have to say they did a nice job.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.920]   It's especially on the iPad.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:06.920]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.920]   You know what else was updated on the iPad?
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.800]   If you have a Sonos, they've updated their iPad app too.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.560]   I am a, I'm becoming a huge fan of Sonos.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.520]   Sonos is like the Roku for audio and it plays your iTunes music.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.840]   It plays your, it doesn't use AirPlay just as Wi-Fi.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.840]   It plays Pandora at Last FM.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.240]   All the radio stations in the world and I use it for an alarm clock and it's great.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.560]   It's, anyway, enough of that.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:35.320]   I think it was a pick of mine some time ago, but now that they have an iPad app, I really
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.520]   am loving it.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.920]   So we were talking about control.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.560]   One, one, one story and then we're going to get to our picks of the week.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.560]   We were talking about control.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:47.760]   Ron Gilbert who created Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island one and two.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.960]   Has had a lot to do lately.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.560]   So he's going on.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:59.280]   He's got a big, big rant on the way corporate censorship controls what appears on these
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.920]   boxes and he's not singling out Apple particularly.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.480]   He mentions Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and Comcast, but he does say, and I just thought
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:12.040]   I'd throw this out at you, quote, "Apple has maintained an almost North Koreanish
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:17.240]   dictatorial control over the devices becoming the arbiter of what is good and bad, what
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.520]   is allowed and not allowed.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.560]   They don't have this control over the Mac because it's a real computer and an open
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.120]   device, but they can do it with the iPhone because we were convinced by the cell phone
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:30.080]   carriers they needed control to protect their networks."
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.920]   And Apple was happy to jump on that ship because they could finally control everything
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.480]   that went on the device and we bought into it.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.080]   Apple apologists say that Apple needs this control to maintain this specialness of the
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.080]   device.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.000]   I say that's a load of bull hockey.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.360]   Monkey Island was such a very long time ago, wasn't it?
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.080]   I don't know.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.680]   My position has always been that I do think that the level of control that Apple maintains
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:00.800]   over the devices has a benefit for the consumers.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.840]   And if Apple were ever to push that button so hard that it starts to ruin the device,
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.520]   inevitably it's not like Apple has a lack of competitors who are waiting to pounce, they're
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.480]   the ones who die and pay the penalty for it.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:16.000]   So as long as Apple's willing to roll the dice and make those mistakes, okay, let's
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   let them do it.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.480]   As long as there continues to be a situation where when I go looking for an app on my Android
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.360]   devices and an app for my iPhone devices, as long as I continue to prefer the ones that
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:33.200]   are available for iPhone, as long as I continue to regard the iPhone as a much better experience,
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.600]   I really don't care how the bread gets on the table.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.320]   He does make a good point and the only reason I bring this up is because he does point out
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.640]   that Apple didn't do this on the Mac and they only were able to do it on the iPhone and
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:51.840]   then the iPad because of the carriers already kind of control of the platform.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.920]   Do you think Apple, if it had the capability, would have asserted this kind of, I think
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.520]   they would have over the Mac?
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.520]   Yeah, I think they might have been an interesting data point.
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.960]   Which would have been very bad by the way for the Mac.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.520]   Well, at the conference that we did when we did our keynote speech, I think Brian Schaffener
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:13.920]   or one of the panelists asked, it might have been Chris Christians and asked of the room,
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:18.680]   there were about 250 people in there, raise your hands if you would like Apple to control
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:24.400]   apps on the Mac OS X desktop and one hand one of them.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.480]   Consumers don't choose this kind of control.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:31.040]   I don't think if you asked the same thing about the iPhone, you'd get the many hands.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.040]   No.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.440]   Consumers don't choose this kind of control.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.720]   You think they would, Andy?
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:41.320]   I just don't think that that's at the level at which consumers really look at a device.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:46.840]   If you ask them a poll question saying, would you like to have more control over your devices
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.480]   or less control over the devices?
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.600]   Well, obviously they're going to choose the first thing.
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:56.320]   But if you put the in front of them two phones, both our products have different ecosystems,
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.320]   one of which is very, very tightly controlled and managed.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:03.280]   And as a result, the apps work extremely well together.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.600]   Every service that's available for the OS is also reflected in the phone up and down the
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:12.880]   line and a second device where there's supposed to be a way you can launch a URL, but this
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:16.960]   one doesn't support it and there's supposed to be a way to switch between open tasks.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.040]   But this one decided that because they wrote an application for the BlackBerry, they want
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.160]   to just reuse that same bit of code.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.400]   If you put the two devices in front of each other, then you might get a very different
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.400]   story.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.400]   That's, that's, I don't, it says, well, you know what?
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:37.600]   We will find out because there is a free market and because there are iPhone sales and Android
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.760]   sales can be tracked.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:46.840]   Well, and I think that the assumption there that the phone companies were, where the dog
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.880]   and Apple was a tail, I think that in this particular case, Apple was saying, look, this
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.560]   device can save my life, you know, if I need it to, and I needed to work as that device.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.560]   And I think.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.360]   So that's what's different about a phone.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.360]   Absolutely.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.360]   What about a pad?
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:10.200]   Well, I think the differences are that the carriers at that particular point, they're
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.200]   not the ones.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:14.720]   I think Apple went to the carriers and said, look, this is how this device should be run.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:19.040]   And we, we know that if you run it this way, you're not going to have to have not the concerns
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.400]   of business, but the concerns that come along with what can happen if there are fatal
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:28.640]   accidents is because of the 911, you know, commercial of it went that way.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:33.560]   The real serious issue of that is that it would be a real sad thing to do someone over
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.640]   not being able to use that.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.040]   I think in this case, Apple went to the carriers and said, you know, we have a solution to
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.320]   that problem for you.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.920]   And the solution isn't, let's just shut off all the features as some carriers I know have
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:49.440]   done, but it was, you know, you can work with us and have the cake and eat it too, if you
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.440]   well.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.440]   Right.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:58.720]   One, let's do a couple of wacky stories and we'll get to our picks of the week.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.760]   Julio Oheda Zapata, who writes for the St. Paul Pioneer Press and is a good friend of
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:07.680]   the show, discovered that at the Mall of America, which is one of our biggest malls,
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:10.760]   one of the biggest malls in the world, there is an Apple store.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:16.160]   And soon, my friend, soon, your heart's desire will come true right across the way from the
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:23.640]   Apple store. There will be a Microsoft store right across from the Apple store. Let the
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.640]   market decide.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:30.480]   Well, and it's a monster. I think it's like three times the yeah, look, this is the Apple
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.640]   store here. And then the Microsoft store goes all the way down the hall and all the way
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:36.640]   around.
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.800]   They need a much bigger tech support area. Yeah. I think it creates his own weather system
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.800]   at this point.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:47.120]   It's a whole thing. Holy moly. I think this is going to be a great test of something.
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:55.680]   It's like, Oh, God, it's such a no win situation for anybody. I mean, it's if only Microsoft
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.060]   can lose in this. I mean, you're basically what they need to what they need to do is
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:06.160]   just, Oh, God, I just imagine myself like I being such a snarky bastard and just going
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:10.200]   in there and saying I've got this with with a YouTube camera saying, here is a device.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:15.680]   It's easier to get this device on Apple's one free Wi-Fi or on Microsoft's free Wi-Fi.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.680]   Yeah, you're right. Here's here's Julio's video of the Apple store. This is the Mall
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:25.920]   of America, which is a very big mall. Lots of foot traffic. And then across the way coming
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:35.080]   soon, the Microsoft store. Do you think they're just hoping people will get confused and be
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.440]   heads down and might walk wander into the wrong wrong one?
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:43.160]   I think it's actually the people on the on the wall. They're they look like happy. Right.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.880]   They look like a blue t-shirt of death. I think in a way, this is really great for consumers
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:53.400]   because you know, you got a choice. You can walk into one, take a look at what's there,
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.520]   walk across the way. This is exactly what markets are all about. Oh, and there's the
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:05.320]   Lego store. If you really want to get a Lego computer, that's a competition. We have luckily
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.880]   there's two Microsoft stores near me one up in and coast of Mesa. I think it is. And they
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   just opened one down in Fashion Valley. And again, it's the same thing where I think in
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:19.400]   Fashion Valley's case, the Microsoft stores on the left side and you know, Apple's on
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:24.600]   the on the right side. But you know, I've walked in and they're pretty pretty nicely put together.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:31.520]   But I notice everybody's just kind of standing around staring at the surface table. Yeah.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:36.360]   Which is really cool. I mean, it's fun to play with. It's sort of like, you know, I don't
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.680]   know if it's going to be the phenomenon that Apple's Apple stores have been for in terms
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:46.960]   of promoting the products. Yeah. I love it. We'll see. We'll get a report from Julio in
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:53.080]   a couple of months. Our final story, the actor Tony Curtis passed away last week, age of
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:59.200]   85. One of our greatest actors. Remember him from movies like Some Like It Hot, the sweet
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:06.040]   smell of success, the defiant ones. He was buried at a funeral attended by his daughter,
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:15.320]   Jamie Lee Curtis and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and porn star Ron Jeremy. I don't know what
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:20.360]   he was doing there. There's a free buffet. Free buffet. And he was buried with some of
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:25.440]   his favorite items, the novel Anthony adverse, which inspired the name Tony Curtis and Armani
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:35.520]   scarf, driving gloves, a Stetson hat and his iPhone. Yes, Tony Curtis, buried last week
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:41.920]   with his iPhone and friends, if if you're thinking about my funeral arrangements, can
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.640]   I have the iPad? I like the larger screen. Thank you very much. I just hope they turn
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:52.000]   roaming off. By the way, somebody's doing find my iPhone right now and it ain't there
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.360]   anymore. I don't know where it is. Isn't that great? I love it. Let's take a break. When
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:03.240]   we come back, I am going to give you a chance to do your picks of the week. I don't know
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:07.160]   if I do we did dialing warn you guys that you got to come up with some pics. Yep. Oh,
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.960]   you did. All right. We're all set. So you will have pics. But I want to tell everybody
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:16.440]   if you if you don't want to be buried with that old iPhone, if you perhaps like to trade
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:26.000]   it in for a newer model for your final journey about gazelle.com. Don't just sell it. Gazelle
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:34.240]   is the place to get cash for your gadgets. And just, you know, this is actually a great
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.480]   time to upgrade to an iPhone because you enter in your old iPhone. Let's say you got
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:42.520]   a three GS. So I start typing iPhone. Look, it shows you all the different iPhone models.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:47.520]   I'm going to say I think this is actually the iPhone I have the 32 gigabyte. It doesn't
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.880]   make a call. Yes. Well, it's as well as AT&T ever did free of water damage. Nope. Haven't
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.640]   thrown that in the water. And it's perfect condition. AC adapter, original cables. And
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:01.520]   I am going to get a check for $222 enough for me to upgrade to my iPhone four. That's
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:10.360]   what gazelle does. You take all of your used old gadgets. You get them to send you a box.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.720]   They send the box out, return the postage is included. You pile it up with stuff. You
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:20.360]   send it off to gazelle and they go through it. Their experts will check the condition,
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.640]   make sure it matches what you said. They'll wipe all your personal data by the way. And
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:30.120]   then they will sound you a check for what it's worth. It is a great way to get rid of
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:35.560]   gadgets. And if the gadgets are too old to be sold, and I know we have a few of those
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:42.080]   two gazelle's recycle network is green as green can be. This is the best place to get
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:49.880]   rid of electronics responsibly. Gazelle uses only EPA approved recyclers that meet and
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:56.440]   exceed all of the, you know, the EPA requirements. They're they use cloud blue as their primary
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:02.040]   recyclers are band certified ISO 9001 2000 certified on and on and on, you know, all
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:08.560]   the important stuff, no exports, no landfill, no use of prison labor. So a great place to
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:13.520]   recycle one more thing I'd like to mention if you're a nonprofit, gazelle can help you.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:19.320]   This is the modern cake sale. They will set you up with a gadget drive webpage of your
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.920]   very own, you know, gazelle.com slash, you know, peddle him a panthers. That's the, that's
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:29.080]   our local football team, our pop Warner football team, the Panthers. And then you tell all
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:33.840]   the panther parents, you know, just go to gazelle with any old gadgets you got and all the money
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:40.720]   goes to our cause better than a, better than a bake sale and less expensive than putting
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:47.080]   an event on. Let me tell you a lot easier to for all kinds of gadgets, cell phones,
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:56.480]   laptops, cameras, gaming consoles, mp3 players. Don't sell it gazelle it. Go to gazelle.com
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:01.640]   and by the way, after you've put all your stuff on the list there and you're ready to check
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:07.760]   out little trick, little trick here, just put Mac break in as the coupon code and they'll
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:14.600]   bonus you another 5% over and above what they've already promised. Additional 5%. Don't sell
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:21.080]   it gazelle it. And by the way, if you want to support Mac cast, is your coupon code work?
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:25.520]   I don't think so. Oh nuts. No, but you can do you can do the membership thing. That's
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:32.320]   right. Go to Mac cast.com members at Mac cast.com and support Adam in his quest to never have
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:40.560]   to work for a living again. Is it member or members? Member. Single. You got one member.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:46.120]   Become a member. Mac cast.com. I should do that actually. I've been listening for ages.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:51.280]   I really ought to give you a little feel a little something something to the Mac cast
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:56.560]   for Mac Eaks by Mac Eaks. You get extra episodes member exclusives automatic delivery. Yeah,
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:00.600]   I actually just posted for the members the audio from the pedal and the keynote. Oh,
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.440]   that's awesome. It's only that's a you know, that's what we're getting it early. They're
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.440]   getting it early. It will be available to everybody else. We've been trying to figure out what
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:13.320]   can we do? You know, because people do donate and that we give them squat. So I'm really
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:19.400]   not trying to try to think of squat plus more. Get extra. A bunch of extra episodes that
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:24.480]   are member only shows as well. I like that idea. Mac cast.com. Victor, you got to do that too.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.880]   Yeah, I should. I look at you know, somebody like Don McAllister has really made a go of
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:34.840]   it with with freemium product. And I think it's a really great idea. A great way to go.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:38.960]   All right. Time for our picks of the week. Andy and not co. We like to start with you.
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.360]   What is your pick this week, my friend? Well, I'm glad I kind of leave early because it
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.000]   would have been before I knew that the creator of one of my favorite word processes for the
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.680]   iPad was going to be a special guest. It would have been awkward to say, huh, there's this
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:59.000]   really great app called elements and a really big fan of it. And then it would have been
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.800]   doubly awkward to say, but there's like, what are two things I don't like about it? And
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:07.120]   sometimes I use this other app that's also awesome. So so I was just like this last week
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:11.560]   and he does make a great product. But what what do you have instead? I got I got I got
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:19.560]   two. There's whoops, the photo app for one. So there's an app called plain text that I
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:24.720]   like a lot. I like both of these apps, but just for different reasons. This is plain
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.960]   text. If the auto exposure is going to work, no, it looks good. Yeah, we can see it. And
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:35.160]   this is the right the right room, folks, right? Exactly. The hog based software, I believe.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:40.960]   And they do two it does two things extremely well. Now, first of all, it is your basic
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.720]   edit text files that live both on your iPod and on Dropbox at the same time. But it has
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:49.320]   a feature that I really, really like, which is what you're looking at right now. The or
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:54.480]   what you're not looking at right now. You're looking at it. It is simple. It is uncluttered.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.960]   It is very and it's very, very pretty. It's not a stark typewriter interface, but all
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:03.960]   at the same, it's a very, very lovely thing to be looking at for one, two, three, four
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:09.360]   hours while you're trying to write something. And even when you are even when you go to
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:16.000]   see the app, the file listing to open stuff up, it doesn't use the standard iPad file picker
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.120]   or rather iPad, a gutter interface. He does a brand new type of view that I think it's
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:28.120]   really, truly is a great example of how iPad apps should be written because there's nothing
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.440]   on that screen that shouldn't be there at the time that it's there. When you do need
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.720]   to add lots of information there, it's done in such a beautiful, such a beautiful and
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:41.160]   lovely way. And if you're in sort of a long form writing jag where you just need to write,
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:44.840]   write, write, write, write, write, write, it works incredibly well. The only thing I don't
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:52.480]   like, so I said that I switched between these two apps because when I'm writing long form
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:57.280]   and I don't really, I'm not writing for purpose, I tend to go for plain tests because it's
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:04.240]   just so nifty to look at. I switch over to elements like this when I'm writing columns
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:11.200]   and stuff like that on my iPad because it's just a, it is part of the simple word processor
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:15.800]   movement, but it has two special features that are hard for me to live without. One
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:22.320]   is just a simple word count feature. So if I need to know how close am I to, I can't
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:28.680]   go, I can't go too long for print. And also I try to keep an eye on, we wouldn't, we
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:35.480]   wouldn't even run things for the web. If it's 1500 words, that's just about right. If it's
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:40.400]   2,000, 2,500. Okay, son, once I exceed 3000, I'm like, you know what, you know that eight
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.080]   heard word intro about the banana splits, maybe we can lose that because this is just
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:49.920]   about Microsoft Excel. No, that's the best part of the review. I don't know, maybe I
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:54.040]   might be insane here, but that's just something that I try not to be too self indulgent. And
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:58.480]   it also has a simple clipboard feature where if you tap the button up in the upper corner
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:03.480]   there, there's actually sort of like a second text box so that if you work, if you're using
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:08.320]   it as a scratch pad, just to type up some ideas before you put into the main document,
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:11.440]   or because you're just sort of migrating stuff from into the document, it works extremely
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:16.160]   well. Both of these apps work great. Let me just all zoom out while you're fully looking
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:20.920]   at this, you don't get the stream close up of any eye infection that I might have. I
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:27.120]   mean, the other cool thing about using these apps is that it's possible, it's possible
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:31.680]   to then have the most wonderful multitasking experience you can have almost on any edit,
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:36.880]   almost on any editor. I was writing a column while I was in Pennsylvania last week at a
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.760]   Starbucks. And there's that point which I have to make sure I double check all my product
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:45.400]   names, all my stats, all my facts. And of course, this is just even when even when you
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:49.040]   have the multitasking operating system, it's so difficult to switch, but you can't just
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.360]   have two overlapping windows and work on it that way. But then I realized that, well,
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:33:00.160]   I forgot, I also have elements on my iPhone. So I actually had like the iPad was right
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:03.600]   in front of me and I was doing I was doing my research. And then I was actually making
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:08.800]   edits directly into the exact same file on my iPhone, on my iPhone, no synchronization,
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:13.360]   no transfer, no anything, because it was the exact same file store in the exact same place.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:18.600]   And I'll just work majestically well. So I love both of these apps. I'm glad that there's
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:23.880]   a there I'm going to be interested in the horse race that ensues because the developer of
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:28.800]   plaintext, there's always going to be the plaintext. It's free if you if you're okay
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:35.000]   with ads before 99, you get the ad free version. But he's also working on a version of of
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.360]   right room for the iPad for people who want like more of a high performance editor, who
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.240]   knows when that's going to be released, but you know that that's in the offing. But I
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:48.320]   always I think we all agree that the best situations happen when you have two incredibly
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:52.640]   talented and incredibly good, good apps are trying to steal each other's lunch money on
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:58.680]   a daily basis. Jesse Gross gene is great. I love his stuff, but I love Justin stuff too.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:01.520]   So you're right. We give them both plugs and they do different things. And you know what?
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:06.480]   I have both of them on my iPad. So that's that's that's the truth of that matter. Let's
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:10.600]   see what Adam Christensen has for us his pick of the week Adam.
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:14.640]   Yeah, I have I have a game and I I checked the website to make sure nobody had picked
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.760]   this yet. So I don't think it's been picked. Has anybody picked fruit ninja? No, you know,
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:24.400]   it's funny. I talked to a guy who was like a huge fruit ninja fan the other day. And
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   I keep seeing it is like somebody ever is constantly recommended. What is fruit ninja?
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.160]   Yeah. So I'm a big fan. Let's see if I can hold this up for the folks at home. I don't
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:38.480]   know if I can get it right. Oh, and the glare the real share. Well, what I love about it
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.040]   is I love games that take advantage of the multi touch interface for their their game
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:50.360]   play. So the idea is if you think of your finger as a katana, you know, a katana blade,
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:55.040]   and you slice across and what happens is the fruit kind of flies up from the bottom, you
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.240]   know, apples, pears, watermelons, and then you slice it and the idea is to slice it before
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:05.360]   it drops off the screen and you get points. They have two modes. They have a classic mode
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.360]   where they also throw up bombs and you want to avoid the bombs and slice the fruit. If
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.640]   you slice multiple fruits, you get bonuses. They also have a Zen mode. If you just want
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:18.720]   to go Zen and not have to worry about things, you can just slice fruit your timed and in
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.440]   that. But the thing that put it over the top for me recently is they added game center
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.520]   support and they added a head to head. So you can actually go head to head through people
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:30.920]   in game center. You have your achievements. You can get track of your scores. So you can
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:34.800]   now work with your, you know, work against your buddies and try and get your rankings
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:39.120]   up and stuff like that. And it's on the iPhone. It's 99 cents. They also have an iPad version,
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:43.040]   but I really just like the the iPhone version because I can pop it open and play a quick
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.280]   game. And it's just beautifully designed. You know, I love stuff that's really well
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.000]   designed and put together and you can even do things once you get really skilled, once
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.360]   become a super ninja, it does support multi touch. So you can use two fingers and three
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.360]   fingers.
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.000]   Five, I'm told. So let me tell you, yeah, you can use all five fingers. If you really
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.040]   could if you can do that kind of maneuver that that's like that. That's almost like getting
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:11.400]   in the, you know, zap the pram area of finger agility. But yeah, that is it. Now see, you
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:16.520]   made this all okay with me. I mean, we've not lost the Mac if we can still say zap the
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:22.520]   pram. Just a really fun game. And I stumbled across and I got even better with game center.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:27.240]   So I like that. All right, I'm buying it on both the iPad and the iPhone because I sounds
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.520]   like I need both.
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:35.920]   Yeah, fun fruit ninja. Thank you, Adam Christensen. Let's go to Victor. Kyao. What have you got
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:36.920]   for us?
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:43.320]   So I've got something from a Petaluma company bias sound a sound saver. And I run into
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:47.640]   this issue all the time where I have a lot of old albums and cassettes because I've been
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:53.160]   a musician for all my life and they have this product sound saver. It's 49 95 retail and
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:58.160]   it comes with a little cord that you can then use to hook up your turntable or you cassette
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.360]   deck to your Mac and then it'll bring the files in there using their sound soap technology
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:08.240]   to get rid of the pops and the clicks and the hiss. And it does a really good job for the
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.760]   price point. It's not going to be perfect. But for the price point, it does a good job,
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:16.640]   a consumer product. And man, it's just been really great. I brought it home after the
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.160]   conference. And that's not even though we got home late, I put an old band audio that
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:28.800]   I had from a long time ago, 79. And it did a really good job. Controls are easy and it's
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:32.840]   cheaper than sound soap at 79 and get this 49. So it was nice.
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:40.120]   I've been using sound soap for a long time. That's kind of the king of clean up plugins
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:45.200]   for any audio program. And yeah, I like it a lot. So that's good. I'll have to check this
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.200]   one out.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:50.560]   Yeah, that's over at that bias dash ink.com, I believe.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:38:02.320]   Dot com. I found a very interesting iPhone app that lets me it's there's a Chrome plugin
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:12.360]   for it. There's a Mac app for it. And there is a a Windows app for it. It's called my
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.880]   let me see if I get this right my iPhone. I bookmarked it. And of course, I've lost
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:22.960]   the bookmark. It's my iPhone desktop and the or my phone desktop is no no I my phone desktop
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:30.760]   dot com. And the idea here, oops, put the screen up. The idea here is that you can very
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:41.480]   easily transfer phone numbers, URLs, maps, texts, notes or images to your iPad iPhone
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:47.240]   or iPod touch from applications on your desktop. We've had kind of this capability on Android
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:53.800]   for some time. This is such a great idea. You download the Mac, Windows or Linux desktop
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:58.680]   client and put that on your desktop. There's a Chrome plugin too, which I use Chrome all
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:03.360]   the time. So that makes it even easier. And then you put the application on your iPhone.
