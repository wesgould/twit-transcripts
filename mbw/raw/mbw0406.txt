[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.540]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover Mac and
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.220]   Apple News Weekly.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.060]   And here we are again.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.820]   Seems like we just did this last week, Alex Lindsay in studio once again from
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.860]   the pixelcore pixelcore.com.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.260]   >> I'm here.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.020]   >> Good to see you.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.420]   >> Good to be here.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.660]   >> You got your summer haircut.
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.220]   >> I did.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.980]   I get my quarterly haircut.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.380]   >> You know, it gets pretty shaggy and I put a lot of product in it.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.800]   And I'm like, okay, I can't take a Candace.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.200]   >> Four times a year.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.680]   >> Usually is.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.320]   >> Candice, you go to Candice, so no way.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.000]   We share barbers.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.160]   I see Candice more than you do though.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.800]   >> You do a lot.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.000]   >> I think she has to look at me like for a second and make sure she still
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.720]   recognizes me, yeah, exactly.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.360]   >> Mr. Hughes.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.480]   >> Also here from imore.com, it is Renee Ritchie back to Marjial.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.800]   >> I miss the studio, Leo, I can't lie.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.080]   You were so much more three dimensional when I was there in person.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.120]   >> It was fun having you guys here.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.420]   >> And that great picture, Andy and Akko, you took of all of us.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.660]   Why was I making a face?
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.300]   I don't understand.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.060]   Andy and Akko from the Chicago Sun Times this year.
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.460]   >> I don't know.
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.760]   I think it's because we, I think we only had a few like five seconds to get it done
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.700]   because we're sure people and we had to do it quick and we didn't do the countdown
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.940]   321 look presentable.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.620]   And so.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.100]   >> I feel like I kind of look like one of those teenagers who doesn't like having
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.220]   his picture taken.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.100]   And so is mugging for the camera here.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.140]   I have the shot.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.300]   >> I think they're tongue out.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   >> I think they're like my lis virus.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.300]   That's what she said.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.300]   >> Leo smile.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.300]   Look at the camera.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.300]   Leo, stop it.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   >> Leo.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.820]   >> Trying to load this from the drop, the drop box that you've placed it on.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.760]   You didn't take it down, did you?
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   >> No, I did not.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.360]   As a matter of fact, I, or I can with the power of my wall of sound set up here.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.080]   >> You can actually do that.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.560]   Put it up there instead of Craig Federighi.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.800]   That's a good shot.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.320]   >> That's a gorgeous picture.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.520]   >> Love having that.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.540]   I should make that my banner for something.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.540]   There it is.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.540]   I got it on my screen.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.540]   Just took a while to get there.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.120]   >> I was worried that it might freak people out because here we are in this screen and
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.980]   then there we are on that screen over there.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.980]   >> The odd thing.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.180]   >> I would like to blow people's minds with our analysis, not with our video trickery.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.020]   >> Video trickery, eh?
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.860]   That's what you call it?
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.660]   >> Yeah, I don't know why I'm doing that.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.280]   There's two frames, one of which you have your eyes semi-close.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.900]   >> Yeah, no, this is the better of the two, I'm sure.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.180]   You look good.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.420]   You look like I look like I'm in the middle of saying something, which is not the best
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.420]   thing.
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.420]   >> That's good.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.420]   I don't know.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.420]   I look like I'm sitting on something strange.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.420]   Alex looks like he's planning his next revolution.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.540]   >> Andy looks a bit like what I'm always doing.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.780]   >> And Renee just looks like a nice guy, as always.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.780]   >> That's a great picture.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.740]   Anyway, thank you for your attention.
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.740]   >> LMBEM1s.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.740]   >> And we were so young and happy back then.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.980]   >> That was worth the days.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.540]   People seemed a lot of great here.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.340]   >> Yeah, well, we didn't start.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.180]   >> Look at that, we are great.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.660]   We are great beards, aren't we?
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.660]   Holy cow.
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.140]   >> We're like the Craig Federico Club.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.860]   So here we have, we like to do this one week later.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.420]   After it's all sunk in, the big WWDC is over.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.940]   Did any of you go?
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.140]   >> I didn't realize this, but we had a film girl on Sunday on Twit, Christina Warren,
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.540]   and she won some sort of lottery that she got to stay through the developer conference
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.620]   and even got to abrogate the NDA so she could see stuff and talk about it.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.740]   Which is the first time Apple's ever done.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.020]   >> They changed the terms of the NDA for the betas and stuff like that where you're not
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.420]   allowed to post screenshots, you're certainly not allowed to post code, but you can now
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.780]   talk about it in the abstract.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.500]   So you can talk about the features you've seen, you can talk about how you intend to, how
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.020]   excited you are, of course.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.020]   But yeah, that's an interesting twist, isn't it, compared to even the impossibility of previous
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.220]   years of having 2,000 people under NDA and no secrets getting out.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.700]   Now either Apple is either becoming more open or they're simply acknowledging that it's
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.140]   very, very tough to tell people that you are not allowed to even refer to stuff that
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.900]   is being talked about at WWDC.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.900]   >> Especially now that they're releasing all the videos to anybody with a developer account,
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.420]   whether you pay for it or not, can now get access to every single one of those videos.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.420]   >> Right.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.420]   I actually don't think they're even logged in.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.620]   I think anybody can go there now.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.420]   I've gone many times and there's never been a paywall.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.860]   >> I'm not sure if I'm special.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.140]   >> I've been binge watching these videos.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.340]   I haven't seen more than two episodes of House of Cards or Game of Thrones, but I've
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.460]   binge watched the entire WWDC said.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.260]   I do remember at one point coming back the next day and trying to refresh the page and
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.260]   having to log back in again.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.860]   I don't know if that was related to the videos or because of the developer ID.
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.260]   >> But you don't need a developer account and anybody could watch this.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.060]   >> I think this is a really good example for other people doing conferences that Apple,
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.660]   it's not about what people are saying.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.740]   That's important and what we all want.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.740]   >> But that's not what brings people to conferences.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.060]   What's bringing people to conferences is the engineers you get to talk to and the people
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.700]   that you get to meet and everything else.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.700]   That's why it sells out in like 45 seconds when they announce it.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.980]   >> To be fair, Google's done it for years at Microsoft did it, it builds this year.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.460]   Apple's the last, the party.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.220]   >> No, I'm saying this is just another example of the ones that really work.
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.060]   For those, I think that a lot of, that's what we do is we do live streaming.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.900]   We're constantly talking to clients about the fact that-
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.780]   >> Open it up, don't put it behind a pay walled up but behind a wall of any kind.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.780]   >> Yep.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.780]   >> You want us to spread the word.
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.060]   >> It's interesting this year too because they're going to be doing an open beta for
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.300]   Yosemite and that's not going to be real.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.100]   I mean, there will be an NDA, but that's not going to be enforceable.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.020]   And more than that, they had the lottery system for WWC so people could get tickets, but
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.620]   they also had some journalists who were given not just journalist tickets but passes for
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.620]   the entire event.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.580]   And the NDA as far as I understand it is just no screenshots, no videos and no reviews.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.540]   And the reason for that is because things are going to change over the beta and if you
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.300]   start doing reviews or screenshots and things change, it creates false expectations with
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.860]   customers and I think they're not getting what they should be getting.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.860]   So that part is totally understandable, but it really is.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.180]   It's a Craig Federico geekier, Phil Schiller, more happy and open sort of a thing and I
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.180]   think it's terrific.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.180]   >> Pretty awesome.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.180]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.100]   >> It does feel like a new era finally under Tim Cook.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.740]   There were so many changes I think.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.900]   It was done so differently and it was so, you know, the other thing was maybe like the
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.300]   old era as they still were taking jabs at Google, maybe even more brutally than in the
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.820]   past, but it does feel a little bit more open.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.820]   I commend that.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.980]   I think that's the right direction.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.980]   >> So no leaks.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.140]   >> I mean, at the same time, it's more open, but they were very good at keeping things
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.380]   like Swift as total secret.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.380]   >> Isn't that interesting?
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.140]   We did not know one, we had not heard one thing about Swift as a good example, about
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.620]   Swift until day of, which I thought was interesting because it's just that we felt like everything's
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.620]   gotten really porous.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.340]   >> Well, you know what, here it's very easy.
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.180]   You can keep people who work at Apple quiet.
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.180]   That's not a problem.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.980]   It's a Chinese supplier.
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.340]   It's the manufacturers.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.260]   Those guys, you can't keep them quiet.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.860]   So we know everything there is to know about hardware because it's being made elsewhere.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.620]   But software, you can keep a lid on it because those guys know their job is online and they
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.620]   work for Apple and perhaps they don't even have to be told your job is on the line.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.620]   They care.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.620]   They want to keep it a secret.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.740]   They understand the value of that.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.340]   So did anybody, so you guys have been perusing the videos?
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.420]   I am sure that Alex and I have not.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.180]   So I will open it up to you, Renee and Andy.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.700]   Tell us any sessions you, first of all, some sessions are blacked out until the day of.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:55.900]   What did we learn by either going to WWDC or watching the sessions online?
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:02.260]   >> Just that everything that was said in the keynote was just backed up by real content.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.180]   Every video I looked at, I started off with even the most boring one, which is here's
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.020]   what the, here's what the new camera APIs are.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.580]   And you watch through it and it's not just that, okay, I suppose we will be grudgingly
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.580]   allow you to set exposure.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.220]   It's no, we will let you have like low level fine grain access.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.140]   So if you want to do full on computational photography, we will let you, there's even
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.660]   a bracketing API so that if you want to take a sequence of photos with adjustments as you
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:32.980]   go through, there is micro adjustments to focus with some interesting, one of the things
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.900]   that keeps going through all these videos is that Apple is trying to get away from being
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:43.660]   specific about, and they're trying to teach developers don't count on anything about
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.140]   any device that we may or may not ship.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.940]   Versus in the camera video, they say, we won't let you specify a focus point because let's
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.460]   just say that the distance between the furthest and closest focusing point and the thickness
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.940]   of a device might not be the same from device to device.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.580]   But even this thing will allow you to, they even have access to low level video.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:13.580]   So if you want to do live video transmogrifications, I'm not being as big as half the expert that
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.300]   half of 1% the expert the Alex is, I don't know how big you can take advantage of this
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.300]   API.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.060]   But I was surprised that if you want to have access to the video, you don't have to simply
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.980]   have it capture video and then do something to it later on, you can actually do live processing
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.980]   on it.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.140]   And then when you look at how they've implemented extensions and see that no, it's not just
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:39.300]   simply like an Android, there are ways to drop things into other apps, to pay it on top of
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.620]   other apps, there are ways to make notifications actionable.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.820]   But they're very, very useful, but not really ambitious.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.700]   It becomes really, really clear that what Apple has done is told developers that you
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.460]   can develop an entire separate user interface for your app that only expresses itself inside
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.260]   the notification manager.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.380]   And the limit and when you insert, when you project your features into the camera app
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:08.180]   or any other app that lets you, that lets you, that will accept extensions, it's not
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:13.180]   these simple, here's a function that you can lend out, you can actually project your app
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.940]   and a user interface from your app into that.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.780]   So I can't wait to see how developers really take advantage of it.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.060]   Because as I'm, as I'm, I get, I intended to just skim over this and maybe download the
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.980]   PDFs to get a sense of it.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.420]   But it really is just like when you start getting into Game of Thrones, you say, I will only
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.940]   watch the one where Peter Dinklage is on trial for whatever, if I didn't catch it.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.140]   I didn't know what it was.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.540]   And then it's nine hours later, like, oh, damn it.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.420]   Isn't 11 p.m. already?
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.260]   Oh, damn it.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:44.500]   I missed my sister's wedding because that really is like, you, the more you dive into
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.620]   this, the more you realize that this is full on the greatest updates that Apple has ever
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.220]   done to Mac OS and iOS.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.260]   Well, this is part of the sea change too, opening up these APIs and letting people in.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.860]   I mean, this is one of the things you never could do on the iPhone.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.860]   It was Apple's way.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.700]   You know, you'd Apple did it, but no one else.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.460]   We have to remember it started with no apps at all.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.460]   I mean, you know, as Apple's, you know, when we, I found my original, my 3G or, you know,
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.300]   I have mine over in the other room.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.540]   I have to find a 30 pin cable to charge it though.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.300]   I can't get anything to launch right now.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.540]   So I'm trying to figure it out, but I was going to give it to my son and I started playing
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.540]   with it.
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.540]   I was like, wow.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.540]   You know, that was like the, it was pretty primitive.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.740]   And you got it, but when you got it, you were just like, oh my God.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.740]   And yet we were thrilled.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.220]   I waited six hours in line for that thing.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.220]   Oh yeah.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.220]   And it was, and it was the best phone we ever had.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.820]   And now it was so much better than anything we ever do now.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.620]   But, but, but, go ahead.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.980]   I was going to say like one of the interesting things for me is that they're about the new
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:39.260]   openers is they had people like Mike Stern, the, the Apple user experience evangelist,
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.620]   so one of the user experience evangelist, he did a whole talk just on design language
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.580]   and how they implemented it on OS 10 Yosemite and what they look for in great apps.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.940]   And Kishinda, who was one of the original web kit engineers and made the keyboard, he
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.460]   just did a talk about lessons that he learned trying to manage projects at Apple, which is
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.820]   not your typical WWC talk, but is a fantastic talk.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.620]   And to Andy's point, Apple has been working on interrupt communication for years.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.980]   It's not like, you know, suddenly as there's a switch in administration, they're like,
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.580]   okay, you guys can go do this.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.020]   It's just that it took them a long time.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.980]   Like it took them three years to get copy paste.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.660]   They had to figure out a system where, you know, malware couldn't travel between apps.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.660]   And the reason that the different views are in different containers is for security because
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.620]   a security first operating system.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.100]   But also let's say you have Facebook, which is not the speltest of applications.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.100]   And that's running.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.660]   And suddenly you have a Facebook notification or widget and you decide to jettison the Facebook
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.980]   app because it's hogging memory.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.580]   What happens to that, that widget or what happens to that notification?
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.980]   Well, if it's in its own container and its own demon, nothing happens to it.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.460]   You're totally free to do it.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.140]   So by making it right, even though it took a long time, it opens up so much more functionality
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.060]   and give such a better user experience that I would have liked it sooner.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.620]   But I'm glad they did it the way they did it.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.620]   I did glance.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.620]   I know that.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.620]   Go ahead.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:56.580]   Apple has previously on the iPhone actually had an about face on a full on philosophy.
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:01.620]   Everyone I've spoken to about the the the the the Alama of third party apps says that this
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.700]   was a change of tactic that they really did think that web apps were going to be the way
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.700]   to go.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.780]   And then they changed their mind on it.
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.780]   Who knows for sure.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.940]   But everyone I've ever been speaking to since then has said that they actually that actually
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.460]   was a turn of opinion.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.480]   But here I hedge my bets last week's I didn't know whether this this new openness was a change
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.760]   of philosophy or as Renee said it took them a long time to figure out how to do this in
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.580]   a way that they felt was going to be safe for the platform.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.100]   And over the past week, everyone I've spoken to has said exactly that that it really has
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.220]   been it took four years to figure out how to make apps work together in such a way that
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.460]   it's not going to cause malware.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:39.500]   It's not going to cause de stability as going to be a net positive as opposed to a net set
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.420]   of set of disappointments for everybody.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.060]   There's a bit of a mix because to Andy's point you could engineers could have built
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.500]   all this stuff and someone high up could just say no.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.620]   And then after a while the change in the person I up will say yes, but they've been working
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.900]   on it for a long time.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.860]   It's hard to do that and maintain security and after you know one of the things they
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:03.140]   changed a lot in iOS seven and the iPhone five S was a security model significant changes.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.140]   And it may be that they wanted to wait till those were implemented.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.940]   And then you can start talking about opening an API because now you know what the what
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.060]   the safety parameters are.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.780]   You also have hardware support for encryption points.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.940]   And I was very I read the extensions API and I was very impressed.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:25.780]   It seems a very clean elegant implementation that both protects the user and gives developers
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.100]   a chance to kind of start looking into other apps.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.100]   I think it's good.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:33.580]   I think I think that number one is I think that part of this is also the maturity of the
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.580]   operating system.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.780]   Yes, when you open up that that API that means that you're now locked in.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.380]   So what you this is an agreement.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.220]   It's not just that you're giving people access to your operating system.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.500]   It's that you're making an agreement that you're only going to change it at a certain
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.500]   pace after that.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.580]   And so so I think by opening these up we're now saying okay we've gotten to most of added
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.580]   what we want.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.660]   We're going to keep on changing it, but it's not going to change at the pace that it changed
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.660]   that before.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.100]   I think the other thing though is I think that with the privacy I think that what Apple's
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.900]   doing is playing a game that a lot of their competitors like Google may not want to play
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.340]   because Google's obviously going to work on their encrypting email, they're working
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.020]   on privacy, but there's this backend issue of wanting to run ads and running to get
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.020]   information.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.780]   And Apple is I think we're going to continually see Apple doing things that break those things.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:21.380]   And because that's not because they're trying to hurt Google, but because they are differentiating
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.780]   themselves from many of the other competitors who run on an ad based model.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.880]   It's been a lot of time on Sunday to it talking about this and saying both Apple and Microsoft
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.540]   have an opportunity here to say hey we're the anti-Google.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.900]   You're going to pay us up front.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.260]   It's going to cost more.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.420]   And what you're going to get from that is privacy.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.980]   People aren't going to know when you're walking by unless you decide you want them to know.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.980]   They're not going to.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.980]   I mean I can see Apple doing this kind of thing that they're talking about where you're
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.580]   you have a different credit card number every single time you make a purchase.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.980]   You know those are the kind of things that and you know those are the kind of things
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.820]   that they can implement in a way that's difficult.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.340]   Well they have a cryptographic base now in there.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.260]   I was just jab brought me my original life phone.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.260]   Look at that.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.840]   This is the thickest heaviest smallest iPhone we've ever made.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.320]   This thing is noticeably thicker and heavier and not going to sell any of those.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.320]   Yeah exactly.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:18.240]   It's so it's so small that look how big the headphone jack looks on this thing.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.240]   It looks monstrous.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.440]   Well no because remember they had a drill it out because you even so much metal.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.920]   You can put in a standard headphone connector and right.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   It's so deep.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:33.200]   There are little adapters that we had so that 3GS I think is still a good looking phone.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.120]   Oh it's still still good looking.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.680]   I would if that were in a if that were in a claw machine outside the supermarket I'd
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.360]   definitely put in two quarters to risk getting this.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.120]   Is this the original one or is this the original one?
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   I can't.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.120]   The right is the original one.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.240]   The metal act is the one at the bottom right with the antenna cut out.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.160]   It's kind of that.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.720]   I have to charge you.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   I charge mine up.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   I found it.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   I didn't start.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   I bet this is.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.080]   I got no I got I I charged mine up a few like about a year ago because I was doing I was
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.040]   doing one of my like huge camera shootouts.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.120]   I thought oh well let's let's compare this to let me tell you that is freaking me out
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.280]   that when I look into this camera I have like the live live shot over there and I see you
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.520]   all just like back there smiling and patiently waiting and for a half a second I think that
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.040]   maybe the video has frozen.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.920]   I have to tell my brain not to worry about that anymore.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.480]   Yeah I charge it up and I couldn't believe how slow this thing was.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.520]   I couldn't believe how crappy the screen was.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.080]   It's like we get so it's it's the best way to understand exactly how good a job Apple
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.520]   has done developing the iPhone is to spend 10 minutes with the iPhone one and see no this
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.360]   used to be the greatest phone in the world the kind that people would line up for six
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.760]   hours to go get.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.240]   Six hours of my life.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.520]   But I met some nice people in that life.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.320]   Apple buyers are always fun to hang out.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.320]   I think it was an experience.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   I'm ready.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.320]   I'm charging it up right now.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.000]   You can see it's it's dead but I but I'm going to come back.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.960]   I mean why shouldn't it's all solid state and everything.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   It's you can do it.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.840]   Mine came back just it just wouldn't every time I tried to start open an app.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.840]   Didn't work.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.720]   Well you know well before the show's over we'll boot the iPhone the original iPhone and
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   see what happens.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.680]   It'll be a little slice of my life from 2007.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   Exactly.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.960]   You know your bill break apps.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.440]   One of the things a lot of attention has been paid to is the Xcode 6 you know and when you
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:30.040]   develop to Xcode you can have target you know devices iPhone 5s you can have an iPad
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:35.880]   and now you have independent screen or variable screen resolution devices and and a couple
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.160]   of people have said that there were a number of mentions about this in the in the in the
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.840]   sessions as well at WWDC.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.440]   They're one of you have anything to say about that.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.920]   Are we going to does that is that merely Apple saying we're going to be more flexible or
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.040]   is that paving the way for new screen sizes.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:58.600]   This is Apple's trying to emphasize to developers do not count on your app being projected into
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.080]   a screen of any specific size.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:08.240]   I thought it's not and they're doing it without having like 800 bogus screen sizes in there.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.800]   They get they get it by saying well here's interface builder here's a square to populate.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.600]   So they're really trying to make people think think of your think of your app filling into
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.840]   an iPhone screen into an iPad screen a small iPad screen into the dashboard of a car.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.160]   Think about it as something that could fill an Apple TV screen and any other device that
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.680]   may come and go.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.080]   Apple's this is not a new thing.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.840]   Apple's been talking about the screen size independence and you know an auto fill auto
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.800]   flow sort of operations for years now.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.560]   This is the first time they've really sort of kicked people in the head and said that
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.200]   we don't want we don't want to create an interface builder environment that makes you
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.240]   think in terms of filling this iPhone size device.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.960]   We want to think we need to think of a blank screen of any size that you're going to have
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.120]   to populate with your with your interface.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.640]   And now that now that you're projecting parts of your interface into other apps that's also
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.920]   important because even if Apple doesn't do a wristwatch with a color touch LCD screen
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.480]   you're still going to have to think about how can you make your photo app or your scheduling
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:14.080]   app useful in a square a square size of real estate.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.680]   By the way we do have the question engine up.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.480]   Twit.to/mbw406.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.480]   Twit.to.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.480]   No dash this time.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.480]   You don't we no need to anymore.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.720]   Yes we can roll our own shortener.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   Twit.to/mbw406.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   It says 401 on the screen.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.880]   It has the wrong date.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.800]   But that's that's that's ours.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.400]   And we want to play to come here actually.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.520]   We use the question engine.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.080]   We use the question engine to give you a chance to ask questions and vote up or down
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.720]   the questions that you want to have answered.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.360]   And we'll talk about those in just a little bit as well.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.080]   What else did we before we wrap this before you move on.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.880]   The other thing that's interesting about the scaling stuff and they showed that off in
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.400]   the state of the unions if you want to see a high level version of that just go to the
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.760]   state of the union video is that it provides like constraint based layout exactly what Andy
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.760]   said.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.360]   And you can imagine that's for different screen sizes.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.360]   But they also they started off with you know this is a 3.5 inch iPhone, 4 inch iPhone.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.360]   This is an iPad.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   This is horizontal.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.120]   But very quickly they got into you know compact rectangle small.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.120]   Right.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.080]   And you can imagine that for different screen sizes but also when you start having you know
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.200]   maybe multiple pains in the same window you have and they explained this nicely which
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.880]   they haven't really for customers that I'm really explain this before it's knowledge.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.240]   It's known inside that the iPhone is one column shown at a time where the iPad is two columns
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   shown at a time.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   Oh.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.680]   And if you're not dependent on the device you know you can eventually have maybe two different
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.120]   app side by side or one small app and one big app side by side.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.360]   It just liberates them to do a lot of more stuff with iOS than the pixel for pixel interface
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   did.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.840]   I'm excited.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.320]   How about fingerprint ID?
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   Touch ID?
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.600]   Did they how's the API there?
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.320]   Does it look like it's complete enough?
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.320]   That is really good.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.520]   So the problem with Touch ID previously is that for example if you just use a Touch ID all
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.760]   it does is release a yes/no token and there's concerns that an app could spoof that.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.240]   That's not very secure.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.280]   And you know there were some circumstances with PayPal on Samsung you know immediately
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.280]   that gets compromised.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.520]   And yeah that was a CSI spoof but whatever with this it goes into keychain.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.080]   So the token is actually being given to keychain it's not being given to developers and then
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.360]   keychain which is an existing system on iOS and OS 10 since last year verifies the user.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.080]   And again it's really simple.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.640]   They wanted to get the foundation in there which is keychain so they could do this in
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.720]   a responsible effective way.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.520]   Yeah security first.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.520]   Security first.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.720]   You got to admire that I really think.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.440]   You got to admire what they're doing.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:41.480]   This is you know this response to the analysts who said Apple has 60 days and why are they
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.360]   taking so long is Apple has been moving fairly methodically and carefully.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:51.440]   That's why they didn't even mention the iWatch there but they're laying it seems to me you're
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.880]   right with the variable screen resolutions laying the foundation for some interest.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.880]   You could see that I mean I don't think they would have shown it anyway but it didn't
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.360]   ever appear no matter what the analysts said no matter what what people were saying before
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.720]   last year the Apple crew is just kind of like well you know yeah we've got some big stuff
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   we've got some interesting stuff.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   We've got some interesting stuff.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   We're going on 4000 API.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   That's the good thing in the back of their head you know like in the morning.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   We got the 4,000.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.200]   And those are just iOS 8 APIs.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.200]   Yes.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.920]   And that was the thing though it was security first privacy first people first when you look
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.200]   at their approach to something like handoff or test flight or family sharing it's not
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.040]   based on devices anymore it's based on your Apple ID on people and that's a completely
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.040]   different thing.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.120]   I mean there windows is doing interface first you have the same interface everywhere.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.040]   Google's always been a cloud truth store first you log into the cloud everywhere.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.000]   Apple's like no your people you have as long as we can identify you as long as you know
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.880]   you have a credit card as long as we know it's your device it's about you and your content.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.000]   It's not about our devices or our cloud servers or anything else which is an interesting take
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   a very human take.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.840]   I want to be very fair because I you know I use other stuff and I'm compliment other
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   stuff.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.440]   I was I thought the Samsung approach try everything release everything and see what
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.840]   consumers like was an interesting approach.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.160]   But we've often criticized companies for moving you know thinking in terms of the quarterly
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.600]   result and moving too quickly and moving this way in that way.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.120]   So when a company does something that really the market's not going to like and analysts
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.680]   are going to complain about even users are going to complain about but it does it right
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.160]   and methodically and slowly and carefully I have to praise them.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.240]   I think that is really remarkable in this day and age and it comes down.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.560]   It comes down to the real benefit of all the money that that Apple has isn't the ability
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.560]   to buy beats.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.480]   It really is the ability to control and dictate their own destiny.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.880]   They don't have to listen to any company they don't have any pressure from anybody to do
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.960]   anything other than exactly what they want to do.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:47.120]   And when they have a roadmap that is so clearly going to pay off big boy does it pay off.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.800]   Now I'm glad that there are multiple companies that are pursuing multiple points of view.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.000]   I'm glad that for this good to have got Google.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.200]   Well we'll probably particularly because right now that we actually have on the on the
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.560]   immediate horizon.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:07.240]   Interapp communication, interact functionality extensions notifications that are actionable.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.440]   Some customization going on or some some new some new widgets and stuff that will happen
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.440]   that will help you out when you're launching apps and managing people.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.440]   That's now that we have it.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.720]   But remember that for years we had no idea if Apple even had any interest in that.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   And meanwhile for two years that was all that was all available to anybody who had an Android
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.360]   device and it worked very very well.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.840]   So I'm just glad that there are so many different points of view being represented with different
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.640]   operating systems and different hardware.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.960]   We were going to take a break come back and talk more.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.880]   There's lots more to say about what we've learned after WWDC.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.560]   Some interesting rumors and speculation about the Beats acquisition and more still to come.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.120]   Andy Anacow from the Chicago Sun Times from iMore.com or named Richie Alex Lindsey of
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.120]   Pixel Core.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.320]   Our show today brought to you by Linda.com.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.960]   What do you want to learn today?
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.440]   Boy when you talk about Linda there's nothing you can't learn.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:04.520]   Everything from using OS 10 Mavericks and soon OS 10 Yosemite to developing for iOS 7 and
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   iOS 8.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.520]   I'm sure they're working on them right now.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.840]   This is an amazing place.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.400]   Linda.com you've probably heard me talk about it before.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.840]   Thousands of courses, 2400 with more added weekly.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.080]   They're all produced at the highest quality.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.240]   These aren't homemade YouTube videos.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.720]   By the best instructors people we know and love, people we respect.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.360]   Many of whom have actually appeared on some of our shows.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   Norman.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.360]   Norman's great.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.120]   He's a professor at the, okay look at your learning about he's based on a professor
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.080]   at USC's film school.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   Exactly.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.000]   Can you get better than that?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I don't think so.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Awesome.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.080]   You know when I signed up for Linda?
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   When?
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.080]   In the second week.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.080]   Yeah well we've had a lot of growth from Linda.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.080]   I've known Linda.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.880]   Why am I since she was on the screen savers?
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.960]   She started doing great books on web design.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:05.480]   They have classes and you know even business skill classes, business software of course
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:14.320]   but business skills like negotiation, communication, data analysis, online marketing, CAD, design,
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.360]   of course Photoshop, in fact Bert Munroys, incredible Photoshop videos are free at the
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   beginning of each week.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.680]   You can watch them.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.480]   Lightroom 5, basics of image sharing.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:30.360]   Up and running with QuickBooks online, getting things done, steam OS for developers for first
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.360]   look, things like that.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.360]   I mean this is a great resource for anybody.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.800]   What's nice is it's a flat fee.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.520]   $25 a month gives you access to all the courses for $37.50 a month.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:45.640]   You can get the premium plan which gives you exercise files so you can work along with
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.080]   your instructors.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.760]   But right now we're giving you seven days of complete run of the place for free which
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.960]   is pretty cool.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.560]   If you haven't done this you just take the seven days, go out and check it out.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.560]   It's one of the things.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.360]   How much do you learn in seven days?
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.520]   The big thing is that you don't, what you very quickly realize is you have this huge
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.720]   resource of professional level you know how to's that you can go through and it's not
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.760]   just that it's nine hours of Photoshop.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.360]   It's broken all up into little bits and pieces of oh I need to learn this one little thing.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:20.120]   I was checking my work for my, I did a mic class, a microphone class for my students in
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:25.160]   Rwanda and I was checking my work and I ended up on Lynda.com and there's a video on how
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:32.360]   to put works on and how to do them and it was a great well shot video and it's just
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.120]   almost anything you can think of especially in media but they've definitely expanded to
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.720]   a lot of other things and you just realize for $25 a month it's just like this little
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.520]   thing you have in your back pocket that you can just jump in and grab a little bit of
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.920]   knowledge here and there as you need it and almost everybody I know has a subscription.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.360]   Chris Breen teaches forum.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.960]   I mean everybody does it's really a great place so get the seven days free you give
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.240]   you a good idea of how much fun it is by the way you should say it's fun to learn at
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.880]   Lynda.com not only effective but fun.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:04.520]   LYNDA.com/Macbreak for your seven days free do give it a try.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:09.400]   It is a great way to learn and they have corporate memberships we of course have a
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.640]   group membership for our staff so that if they want to polish up their skills it's a
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.200]   good thing for a company to do.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:19.400]   LYNDA.com/Macbreak oh if I only got enough juice it's starting to boot.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.480]   Oh wait a minute.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   Hello planet.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.720]   Waiting for activation this may take some time.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.360]   Yeah it may take a long time.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.920]   But you're a mini sim I think.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.720]   You know it's interesting though it's got the right date and time that's pretty impressive
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.240]   isn't it?
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.400]   Low battery I know.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.480]   So here's the this is the original iPhone.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.200]   You know what I must have wiped it because this is the bit this is the way it came out
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.800]   of the box right.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.440]   These are the update that gave it the App Store and oh is this the iOS 2.0.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.280]   Oh look it's got an app store.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.080]   But wow so this is iOS 2.0 that's fun.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.440]   It look at look how long it took to open that to open that setting straight.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.640]   And yet you can I mean it doesn't look so very different does it.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.280]   I'm actually kind of impressed.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:12.080]   Hinstripe's yeah you get the background the linens and all that but it does put iOS 7
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.640]   in perspective that this was this had been an operating system that had a user interface
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:22.080]   had been pretty static for like six years right and so it was probably time to annoy
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.320]   a lot of people but make some big changes.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.120]   But this feels like I'm seeing an old friend once again.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.360]   Wow maps there's Google Maps.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.240]   Remember that when it came with Google and they liked each other.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.000]   For some reason it doesn't it only see it doesn't have the updated Wi-Fi chip so it
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.880]   only has like B and B in there.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.280]   And I don't think we have well know how guessed it was just very slow.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.440]   But this yeah I don't think we have a lot of whiteboards.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.040]   Yeah I don't think we have any well networks that were.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.520]   Wow.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.720]   I think it's trying to find your notebook which today is the hub of your digital experience.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.440]   Have you seen it with iTunes yet because that might.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.400]   I haven't I don't know it did say welcome to your new iPhone.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.000]   It also is offering to restore from my backup of the iPhone 5 that probably is not a good
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   idea.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.680]   No I assume you purchased this one.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.200]   I know this is old.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.120]   Wow we've never seen anything quite so old.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.560]   All right I'm a revolutionary fallen Leo.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.640]   You're holding revolution in your hand.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.120]   I'm kind of sad that I wiped it.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.200]   So kids something just a little if you're not going to sell it on on Gazelle if you're
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.640]   going to keep it around as I have.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.800]   Don't wipe it because that's your little time machine.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:41.280]   I still have my I still have my message pad 2000 that still has every every friend I
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.480]   was in regular contact with back then every meeting that I was taking back then notes on
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.480]   everything I was writing back then and every time I pop fresh triple A's in there it's like
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.080]   oh hello 1997 Andy.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.720]   I have my I have my newton as well.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.680]   Several newton's and it's exactly right all the data's because I don't think the Newton
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.960]   gave you an easy way to wipe it.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.960]   That's probably why.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.280]   The chair says that has a newton that was their business plan.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.840]   It says it should do G.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.480]   That's what they say in the chatroom.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.600]   I haven't recently said I don't know I keep trying to log in and it won't let me so I
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.080]   don't it does see them now.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.080]   Oh it does.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.600]   Yeah like yeah it's easy FBI surveillance fan too.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   Right.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.840]   You guys know I don't think so.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.840]   I'll be big the core.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.720]   Yes yes would be a good one.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   Should I do guests?
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   I tried production.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.560]   Yeah production might be weird.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.640]   It might be too hard because they make sure they have the crappy old router for the guests.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.120]   I don't even know what the password.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.960]   I mean it's the same as you'd expect.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.440]   No not that one.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.440]   It's not to it guessed.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.440]   No.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.440]   No it's on it.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.440]   You see that orange thing.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.000]   I saw the one but I can't quite read it.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.200]   Anyway that's sufficient.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.640]   We don't I don't want to waste a lot of time trying to get this thing working.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.560]   It's fun that it's there.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.280]   Welcome to your new iPhone.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.840]   Doesn't match any of these pictures.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840]   It's good care of it.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.840]   No scratches.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.360]   Gazelle would probably give you a pretty penny for it.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.920]   Oh I wonder.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.360]   If we do a Gazelle I want to ask how much the original iPhone is worth.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.840]   You know this is something that's probably going up in value.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.440]   Yeah it's collectors item now.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.040]   You wait long enough they go up in value.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.600]   Still the same crappy keyboard though.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.920]   I am so excited about the new keyboards.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.280]   The new keyboards.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.400]   I know that's dumb but that's something that does excite me.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.800]   And I'm very intrigued by what Apple's going to do with iOS 8.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.720]   How about Yosemite?
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.160]   Anything to say about that?
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.480]   When will that public beta go open to everybody?
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.480]   Do we have any idea?
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.480]   A month?
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.480]   I don't know.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.480]   A little while.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.480]   A month or so from now.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.000]   How about the speculation that one of the reasons Apple bought Beats is so that they can use
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.400]   the lightning cable.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.040]   I'm not sure why they'd want to use the lightning cable for headphones to eliminate the headphone
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040]   jack.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   Yeah I mean they could get thinner without a finger.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.360]   I don't know why they need Beats to do that though.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.360]   They could do that on their own.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   They don't need anything.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.360]   I don't like this.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.720]   I had to write something about this because I found it.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.840]   This rumor first came up a few weeks ago and was dismissed as completely silly as those
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.080]   no need to talk about it.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:13.000]   I finally had to write about it last week because now mainstream outlets are saying that
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.160]   "Oh Apple's going to remove the headphone jack."
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160]   Which is stupid.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.920]   There are a lot of ways that they can make a lightning enabled headphone that would be
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   really great.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.000]   Like if you did want to have headphones that had biometric sensors in it, if you wanted
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.320]   to have headphones that had some sort of a really advanced controller inside it that
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:34.600]   could let you keep your iPhone or whatever it is inside, whatever you're carrying it around
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.920]   in to just navigate new playlists and stuff like that.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.080]   So it's not like it doesn't make sense but it doesn't make sense for them to delete a
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.560]   headphone jack completely.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.840]   Well it could be to get digital out because you can do digital out.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.840]   I have a bit right, sure.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.720]   But you've got Beats headphones on, you're not really concerned about it.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.640]   But do you remember the HTC phone that never had a headphone jack had to put that dongle
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.440]   splitter in and then it went on such a bad idea.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.840]   But I can see Apple.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.960]   The one thing the Beats gives them is a lot of market to work with.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:11.600]   So rather than persuading everyone what Apple can do is go "Okay we're going to do a Beats
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:17.160]   if you wanted to you can get the lightning cable for the Beats one that will not require
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.160]   you to use that."
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.760]   And you could have two cables that go into the headset but it has extra features or whatever
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.360]   and slowly and actually move it with a lot of people using it at one time, one direction
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.360]   or the other.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.640]   So that does, I think, I know that Apple would love to get rid of another jack.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.000]   Most importantly to remember is that Apple prototypes everything.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.680]   So like if you can think of it they've probably done it doesn't mean they're going to do it
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.120]   but it means that they wanted to try it themselves to see if it was a good idea or not.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.680]   You wrote a good article Renee on the Swift language.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:50.360]   Four years in the making according to Chris Latner he started on it in July 2010.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.360]   Smart guy.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.360]   Wow.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.720]   Interesting that Apple worked on a language for four years.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.160]   There's some people saying "Well how do we need another language for?"
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.720]   But so far the responses actually seems to be pretty positive.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.480]   I mean the way Apple works is that they try a lot of stuff so they had Latner working
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.480]   on this.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.760]   They had some people looking at Mac Ruby, they had some people looking at various scripting
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.640]   languages and they sort of, over time they figure out which ones they were.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.600]   They were in the search direction they want to go and then it went to the dev tools team
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.720]   and they worked on it.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.760]   Apple kept us a secret because almost nobody inside Apple knew about it.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.520]   Very very few people inside Apple knew about it and then sort of the day of the keynote.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.240]   "Hey you guys should go check out these resources because this is what you're going to be using
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240]   in the future."
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:37.280]   You know the biggest testament to me are the folks at Fullstack IO who are going to,
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.960]   they're planning a course in Swift and within hours they had Flappy Bird implemented in
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.200]   Swift you could download it on GitHub.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.240]   Now that Flappy Bird's the hardest thing in the world to create and open source code
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.240]   exists.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.560]   But the fact is that this is a language that this person had never even heard of until
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.320]   a week ago and now they've got a working thing based on it.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:06.160]   I've talked a lot of developers about it and believe me I'm a survivor of like talking
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   developers about iCloud.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.280]   Mostly about memory management I've heard about but everyone I've talked to even if
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.080]   they say they're not going to switch all their development over to Swift they think they're
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:25.720]   very impressed with it and when I say that the usual leading question is that if I had
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:30.280]   never developed Mac or iOS software before and I have the choice for either learning
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:34.560]   Objective-C or learning Swift I'd probably be learning Swift so that's absolutely the
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.560]   way to go.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:40.720]   Although as somebody pointed out on Sunday on Twitch you're going to learn a language
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.920]   that's going to have features that are changed.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.480]   Well it's not even a 1.0 yet.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.680]   It's beta right.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.640]   So you might not want to abandon Objective-C yet.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:55.120]   I don't think it's a sort of thing that's going to lead people to abandon Objective-C
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.000]   if they've already developed those skills.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.120]   But I think that if you're coming in as a new developer not a new developer in general
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.880]   but you've never developed for Mac or iOS before given the choice between especially
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.800]   if given the range of languages you had available to you if you're developing for other systems.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.080]   If you're now here the choice from Objective-C or Swift I do think that most people are going
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:21.360]   to naturally say I would much rather do Swift it looks like it's much easier and much simpler.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:26.120]   Given that the signature feature of it or one of them anyway is that bonehead mistakes
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.240]   that cost you time and then debugging are now completely impossible that alone for a developer
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.880]   like me who writes one app a year is a big win.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.800]   It was a great blog post from Brent Simmons on Inessential.com where he talked about he's
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.320]   working on Vesper for Mac right now and he wants to write a ton of new Swift's code.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.960]   He doesn't want to, he wrote a new Zwyr, he knows Objective-C probably inside or out
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.960]   frontwards and backwards but he's so excited to write it in Swift and I think we'll get
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.800]   a lot of that because you have months to go before Yosemite launches anyways so you have
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.800]   time to look at it.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.520]   But for a lot of developers it might be nice just to do something new.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.840]   I think it was Brent who wrote about all the bugs that wouldn't have happened had he
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.000]   been developing all along in Swift.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.800]   Plus it's not overlooked the fact that if you write it in Swift it will be a faster
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   app.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.960]   The speed comparison was no baloney.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.720]   People who are testing this are telling me that they're just seeing all these huge speed
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.440]   improvements that are getting absolutely for free.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.480]   They don't have to optimize anything.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.240]   All they do have to do is rewrite it in this language and they get that free speed benefit.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.280]   That's not a trivial thing.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.760]   That's something that might even convince people to if they want to start converting
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.520]   part of their code into Swift to actually do that.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.560]   If they've been stuck with the speedball in the next certain places.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.040]   It goes back to exactly what Leo said.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.360]   Years ago they did LLVM.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:49.880]   Chris Lattner's project was LLVM which got him higher, the lower level virtual machine
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.760]   and they did clang and they did all these things that lets them get to the point where
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.160]   they have their own language written for their own compiler structure.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.240]   Everything that they can control and optimize so that you get those speed benefits and that's
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.400]   a multi-year plan coming to fruition.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:06.800]   Lattner's on Twitter and he says on Twitter Swift is a pragmatic not a religious language.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.600]   It tries to get the defaults right but allows you to change them if they don't suit.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.240]   I think every developer I've talked to so far has been pretty excited about it.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.080]   A lot of them didn't say that we're going to leave.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.880]   A lot of them said that you should still learn Objective C and they're not going to leave
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.880]   it anytime soon but completely but they love a lot of the new features.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.280]   I haven't talked to anyone who didn't like what they saw.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:32.960]   You know what's really cool and I'm very intrigued by it supports Shebang scripts.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.160]   For those of you who have been writing bash shell scripts you can write your shell scripts
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:43.640]   in Swift and execute them with XC run Swift -i.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.200]   This is something from Lattner's Twitter.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.200]   That is interesting.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:53.480]   The reason is you have a new scripting language for OS X as well which really intrigues me.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.960]   It's great that Lattner is tweeting.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:01.440]   This is great stuff he's talking about.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.040]   I think the playgrounds are huge and I do hope that people this could very well become
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.880]   the teaching language of the future.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.360]   Hey let's just go ahead.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.480]   He's a Lattner_LOVM I think on Twitter.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.480]   Yes.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.480]   We'll want to check him out.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.720]   Let us take some questions from the question engine.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.600]   The fabulous Pixelcore question engine.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.080]   There's one Luke Luxton from Toronto has gotten way voted up so we better take that
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   one first.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.800]   Any tips about the best way to start learning Swift from scratch without any programming
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.160]   experience?
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.680]   You seem like you've done a lot on this Rene.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.600]   Is it a good language to learn as a first language you think?
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.360]   That was one of the things that was most popular topics at WWDC when people got a chance
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.360]   to look at that and I think we might have mentioned it but you know we grew up being
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.680]   able to type basic into an Apple II or being able to play with logo.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.160]   There was no way you were going to get Objective-C into elementary school but things for like
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:58.560]   Appcamp for Girls Elementary Schools, the Swift Playground, even REPL maybe you can absolutely
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.960]   introduce someone to that.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.600]   You may want to start with something easier but this at least makes it accessible to way
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.480]   more people at way more different levels.
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.880]   I don't think it's going to be long before somebody writes how to think like a computer
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.240]   scientist in Swift.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:19.440]   The thing is about Python and Ruby 2, there's so many free excellent courses documentation.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.920]   The languages are free and the biggest difference is their cross platform.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.960]   I think that makes a huge difference and might be a reason why I'm not sure I'd recommend.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:35.400]   Did Latner say anything about the idea of making this open, making this cross platform?
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.800]   Someone asked him and he said his goal is to get it to 1.0 and he can't even think about
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.760]   open source until he gets it to 1.0.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.560]   Which is sort of like the best Apple answer you could get.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.440]   This one I think the other thing is I don't think Apple isn't interested in it because
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:50.640]   what it gives them is a coding language that is now very tied in.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:56.000]   They can build it with the whole language thinking about the hardware and the software
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.040]   that they provide.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:03.520]   Just like just as Xcode was very one sided I think this is just another step in that direction.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.720]   Although Latner is a huge open source guy in LLVM and I think Clang 2 are all open source
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.720]   projects.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.720]   Maybe somewhere down the road but I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.720]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:19.720]   Right now I still use Python or Ruby perhaps to learn or I'm a big fan of scheme and Lisp
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.880]   but I'm the only man still standing who believes in that.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.880]   Shamblar!
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.880]   We wrote it in December.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   Of an old timer.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.520]   Actually learning to program with assemblers not as bad as it might sound.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.160]   You learn a lot about how the machine works.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.560]   In fact many of my first programs were written in assembler for the 68,000 for the early
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.560]   Macintosh.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.360]   One of my most prized possessions as my kid was the beige small binder with the instruction
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.360]   set for my Merlin assembler.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.480]   Assembly is not a bad thing.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.880]   I think people sometimes think it is.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:52.040]   And boy in the days and I don't know what they've done lately in Xcode with assembly.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:58.240]   But in the early days of the Mac with MPW you had a great macro assembler language that
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:03.560]   was beautiful, elegant, easy to program, great debugging.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.000]   I like assembler.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   But nobody's decked in this.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   It's not right.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   Exactly.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.200]   Because remember that back then when you had a Commodore 64 or an Apple II that was
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.840]   probably the last time it was possible for an average person to have absolute mastery
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.800]   and control over an entire computer.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.240]   Even when they went into MS-DOS there are points at which you can't learn all about
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.360]   how this controller card works or how this interface works.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.120]   You're going to have to just learn how to deal with it.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:35.480]   In the first time in school when I was forced to take a basic programming course and I was
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.320]   making, because I knew assembler language I was able to say, "Well I don't like this
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.320]   character set.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.320]   I want upper and lower case."
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:45.120]   And so I wrote an assembler, an assembler, an upper lower case just to freak out my teacher.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.040]   And I think the failure of how I did it, that was fun.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:52.560]   The real, as an old curmudgeon I think, the best thing for me when I learned assembly
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.240]   language is just really taught me structure.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:02.720]   Of how important it is, you couldn't do a lot of run pretty loose and still get something
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.440]   to come out the other end.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.200]   And I found that using assembly was an even past scale, but using assembly was a much
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:12.920]   more, you just learned a lot about programming that I think is useful.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.920]   I think that a lot of times these whippersnappers now, they don't have to pay attention to all
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.920]   these things.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.120]   And they're not as efficient as code.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.440]   I have jealous as hell.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.560]   If I had APIs available to me and all I had to do is learn how to make this little mouse
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.360]   inside that's hiding inside my computer, put on the top hat and dance the way I want it
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.200]   to dance, I don't have to build the mouse.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.440]   I don't have to teach to dance.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.360]   Oh boy, what I've got first in life.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.880]   I was writing my own graphics apps because there wasn't anything that nothing existed.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.400]   And then the Apple came out and I was like, "Well they're drawing program is much better
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.400]   than my drawing program."
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   And that was the end of my programming.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   I was like, "I'm never going to catch up now."
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.800]   I don't know.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:57.640]   I'm just going to mention this tweet that I just saw from Paul Finch, a Stanley Kubrick
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.800]   letter to Metro Golden Mayor David August 27th.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   Did you see this yet, Andy?
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   I saw this.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   1970.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.560]   Dear James at MGM, it has come to my attention that you and your studio are considering producing
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.600]   a sequel to 2001, a space odyssey, over my objections.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:15.040]   My attorney informs me that you hold the option and legally there's little I can do
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   to stop you.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:21.080]   However, I'd like you to know that I own the Tapier Bone prop from 2001.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.320]   The one moon watcher throws into the sky.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:29.160]   If you attempt to make a sequel, I will cram that femur up your behind so far it will
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:33.040]   take it as yet undiscovered alien super intelligence to figure out how to dislodge it.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.200]   Seriously, don't mess with me.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.640]   And I took out some of the bad words, Stanley.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.880]   By the way, they never did make a sequel.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:48.680]   I don't know.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.480]   Roy Shider and Helen Mirren.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.480]   That's at least 40% of a really and Bob Bob Balaban.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.480]   I love Bob.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.760]   I think that those three people is 50% of any good movie.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   Okay.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   Even even if in the far, far distant future people were using Apple two C's for as their
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   computer.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:08.680]   I think I think they might have made that movie after Mr. Clark passed on.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.680]   Is he still with us?
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.680]   I don't want to see he's dead.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.200]   I don't think he's passed on.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:20.080]   But I think 2010 was, I think that was that was like while both R&C Clark and Cooper a
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.080]   lot later.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   He was a matter of fact, he was based on the sequel that he wrote or partly.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.680]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.280]   Clark had something to do with it, not Cooper, obviously.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.880]   I wonder who has that Tapier Bone now.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.880]   He was too busy not making eyes wide shut.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.200]   Oh God.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.840]   So to finally answer that question, there are some people who will be teaching Swift.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.880]   If you want to learn Swift, I don't think these will be courses for first-time programmers
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:44.880]   though.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.120]   Yeah, I think the first courses are going to be the big market right now is going to be
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.400]   teaching folks that are doing Objective C in the Swift.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.960]   And then the next round will be all the newbies.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.480]   And also now the JavaScript is now an actual system scripting language.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:04.320]   That might be if you want to your first programming language and to do productive and interesting
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.640]   things with it, that JavaScript might be the way to go if you don't want to do Apple
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.640]   Script.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:15.680]   Unfortunately, that letter like the very famous Sean Connery letter is a fake.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.840]   Darn it.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.080]   I'm so sad.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:24.240]   Oh, we can't have nice things.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.240]   Oh, well.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   Oh, well.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.520]   It's too, it is too good to be true.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.120]   And that's really the fact of it.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.080]   Anyway, it's fun to see.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:38.560]   Not a life accomplishment that what what praise for the way that person lit his life that a
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.200]   letter like that could serve for some reason.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.040]   Yeah, I could definitely see Stanley Kubrick sending a letter like that.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.040]   Here's one.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:51.680]   The question from the New Orleans, Jeff Richardson voted up by our questions on air team.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:57.440]   That is you go to twits.to/mbw for 50 or 60 questions.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:02.340]   If you have a good handful of them vote on them, you know, don't just add new questions.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:06.720]   This one, Jeff asks, what are your and this is a good one to close out this section of
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   the show on.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:12.080]   What are your favorite iOS eight features that have received the least attention so far,
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.480]   Andy?
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.160]   I would have to say the camera features because as good as the camera is, there's always
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.560]   those limitations that limited to being just a phone camera and not only the amount of
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.320]   control that you will be able to have over picture taking, but also the kind of camera
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.920]   apps that will now be possible.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:33.180]   I mean, computational photography is a phrase that if you don't know by now, you will know
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:38.540]   next year the ability to take this tiny little lens and this tiny little image sensor.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:42.620]   And by doing lots and lots of math and taking lots of different pictures, building a synthetic
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:47.980]   image that is as good in quality as a 35 millimeter film camera, those things are possible
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:52.340]   with an A7 processor and the ability to have full control over the imaging feature.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.660]   So I think that photography this time next year is going to be a totally different beast
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.660]   on the iPhone than it ever was before.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.480]   And what do you think?
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.060]   I quite like a lot of the privacy features and I feel like Andy, they're not quite getting
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.060]   a lot of attention yet.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.740]   For example, they're doing randomization of MAC addresses for scanning for the internet.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.040]   They can't track you.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.040]   Sorry.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:15.600]   When you when you when you walk through a mall, even just the fact that your phone is searching
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:20.480]   for a Wi-Fi base station, if you don't connect the fact that your base your ideas being broadcast,
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.520]   they're being they're being collected and used and like that's why I try to remember to
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.080]   turn off my phone and I'm sorry.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.080]   But yes, I'm excited too.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.520]   Well, Andy was showing off a bag that he put his phone in a few weeks ago to make sure
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.320]   that they couldn't track and that also when you go to private browsing mode now, it just
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.420]   shifts you over to a whole new window.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.540]   And I think they showed that for the Mac, I don't know if they've shown that for iOS
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.880]   or not yet, but then it switches into duck duck go modes because they don't track you
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.880]   either.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:48.340]   And there's just throughout the entire thing, the architect that it for security and privacy.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.760]   And that is absolutely a differentiator that will matter to some people.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.600]   And I'm glad that they're since they don't make their money on that, they can of course
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.880]   support to be as generous as they possibly can with that and I for one appreciated.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:04.480]   So iOS and Luke actually asked about this too is using fake or random network identifiers.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.200]   Random is it Mac addresses?
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   Yeah, Mac addresses.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.480]   Randomize the Mac address for the for the phone.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:17.160]   Yeah, but but but but but only like in that mode where you're not connecting to to locate
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.800]   a base station when you connect, then it goes to the real McCoy, sometimes you're not giving
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.160]   it away, you're not broadcasting your identity for free when you walk through a mall anymore.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.440]   It certainly tells when you want the Mac address to be stable, like when you're doing a Mac
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.200]   address filtered something like an Apple's really is going.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.080]   I think we're going to this is a trend that we're going to see across the hardware, the
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:40.240]   operating systems, everything is Apple's going to constantly give you the choice of I want
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.480]   to be I want to be anonymous.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.960]   I want to be secure or I want to be or I want to be known.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.900]   But but as the user Apple doesn't have any vested interest in doing anything other than
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.480]   providing that for you as a super smart.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.680]   It's the same thing with like the keyboard feature there.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:56.640]   The built-in keyboard is local only all the keyboard is local stuff.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:00.320]   If you want a fancy internet keyboard, you have to expressly tell it.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:04.000]   Siri doesn't listen to you have to plug it in and expressly allow Siri to do the hey
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Siri stuff.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   So it's not automatically listening to you all the time.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.400]   Most of the time you have to plug it in I could I keep stumbling on that.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.400]   They don't have a copro.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.360]   So it's because of the photo processor.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:20.400]   Yeah, so leaving the speaker on, but like it's still it's a feature that you can enable
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.400]   or disable.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.280]   It's it's something that they are very conscientious of not wanting to do too much of your stuff
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.080]   on the cloud.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.560]   But that that works on the Nexus 5 too.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.760]   You can if you if you're on the launcher, you can just simply say, okay, Google and
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   it will go.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   Yeah, no, I love that feature.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.000]   I can't remember what it has inside, but with my motor.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.680]   Moto X is getting smarter and smarter.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.880]   Now when my my you can tell the Moto X this just was updated yesterday that your home what
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:47.920]   your home address is and when you're home, you can turn it on that will read you names
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.000]   of people calling all read you text to allow you.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.200]   And so much like this.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:57.960]   Hey, Siri mode, the intent is that you have the phone docked charging next to your computer
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.000]   and it's it's now this little assistant that is talking to you.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.440]   And I think that's why you would a Siri when only when plugged in kind of makes sense.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:09.040]   If I if I can unbottle some more excitement, there's there's nothing I just thought I just
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.680]   remembered that now there seems to be a new feature of location awareness of putting the
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.320]   right app on the lock screen so that there's a love that.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:21.440]   Yeah, nobody that was not talked about, but people have seen that in the iOS beta.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.440]   Right.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:26.240]   So so that if you are like if you are at a Starbucks and you take out your phone, the
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:30.440]   Starbucks app, if you haven't installed, will be on the lock screen and no other apps apart
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:31.920]   from the from the camera app.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:36.120]   And so long as that's being done beyond like I beacons and promotional things long as it's
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.120]   smart enough to know that.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.400]   Oh, actually, you're at home right now.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.520]   So I'll make sure that your son is controller is handy because that's one that's one of
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.000]   the add on apps that I absolutely love for my Android device that it will put it does.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.360]   And it doesn't just give you a splat of 500 apps.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.520]   It is, oh, I'm guessing you're right here in this situation.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.760]   I'm guessing that only these three apps are going to be relevant to you.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.320]   There have been a number of launchers on the Android side that have attempted to change
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.560]   how they look depending on where you are.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.360]   I've never been happy with those.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.520]   What's our handoff works too?
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.520]   It's proximity based.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.560]   If you're working on an email, it knows you're working on it and put the icon for your email
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.760]   either in the dock if it's on the Mac or in the opposite the camera icon.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:14.640]   If you're on your iPhone or iPad, it's, you know, obviously all of this has to be implemented.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.400]   And we'll have to see how it's implemented.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.400]   It's very exciting.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.200]   And go ahead.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.200]   Drinking new.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.800]   I will suggest the drinking game that every time we say the word exciting.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.800]   I did.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.800]   You're going to be drunk.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.000]   It's a bomb half hour in any any any any rational discussion about Iowa's aided and
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   and Yosemite.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.440]   If you're not really excited about what's going to be happening over the next year in
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:41.120]   Apple, you are brain dead or you are insistent on the belief that Apple is doomed.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:44.360]   Randy Lomannick in Mississippi asks this question.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.160]   We'll wrap with this on this segment.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.800]   Do you think the number of new products and openness at Apple are due to the fact that
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.640]   everything doesn't go through one person anymore?
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.480]   Tim Cook seems to be delegating more and get the right team in place.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:55.480]   Let them run it.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.680]   That does seem to be the case, right?
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.680]   It definitely looks like it.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.160]   I don't know that is what we're seeing so far as a result of that.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:06.560]   But I but I definitely think what we're seeing is a lot more of him spreading that out, which
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:12.040]   is definitely the next thing you do after you have a very strong leader is to delegate
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   effectively.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:18.960]   And I think that he's the perfect person to do that to two observations that I can't
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.800]   know for sure because I don't work inside Apple.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:24.160]   This is things from lots of conversations with lots of different people.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.720]   But Flynn, I don't I don't think that it's ever it's ever been really understood exactly
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:33.840]   how much how many people contributed to almost every decision that was happening inside of
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:40.600]   Apple, where the idea of Steve everything going through Steve and having to really sign
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.960]   off on absolutely signing off, but not necessarily having to steer the ship in every direction.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.960]   I think that's there's there's a lot less of that than we think there was.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:53.240]   But also to also to that point, I do know I have heard from multiple people that there
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:59.760]   is there's a lot more freedom to get out of your own lane inside of Apple.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.840]   If you think you if you want if there are a lot more voices in certain decisions, there's
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:07.840]   a lot more contributions again across different across different disciplines.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:12.120]   And whereas before you might have five or six or seven years ago, you might have worried.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:16.440]   Okay, but if I if I say this about this, my stepping on someone else's toes is going to
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.440]   blow back to me.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.200]   Am I going to be told I need to be focusing on the things I'm supposed to be focusing
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.200]   on?
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:24.080]   There seems to be a lot more opportunities for a lot more voices to contribute to things.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.880]   So on that basis, I would say yes.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:27.880]   Our show today brought to you.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:28.880]   Thank you, Andy.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:34.040]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com, our favorite place to go for audio books.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.960]   I'm doing something I don't like to do right now.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.240]   I'm listening to two audio books simultaneously.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.520]   Let's get to running.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.760]   I don't like to do that.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.440]   I like to stick with one, get all the way through it, then go to the next one, but I
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.440]   have a good reason for it.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:50.440]   I'm listening to the Beatles biography that you recommended, Andy tune in is the first
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:57.240]   of a trilogy of Beatles books, the total trilogy is called all these years.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:03.240]   And the first one tune in is what 43 hours in length.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:09.760]   So I think you can forgive me for occasionally dabbling in another book.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.880]   I have to say this you nailed it.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.200]   This book by Mark Lewisen is going to be the definitive biography.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.760]   The Beatles is amazing.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.000]   I highly like it.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.840]   And then I, so on Brian Brushwood recommended the Martian.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.720]   And so Lisa, this is different.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.720]   I've never done this before.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.720]   Lisa who loves audio books and I are listening to this together.
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:34.920]   She says, it's kind of like watching Game of Thrones or House of Cards.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:38.200]   Don't choose cheat on me and watch it without me.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.960]   So I can only listen to the Martian when Lisa is in the same room.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:42.960]   But this is great too.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.800]   The story is really Robinson Crusoe on Mars.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:50.920]   Of an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars through no fault of his own or his team.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:57.200]   It's just an accident and needs to survive four years on the Red Planet to have any hope
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.400]   of rescue.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.040]   And it really is a great book.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.040]   I love it.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.760]   So there's two good books that I highly recommend on Audible.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.440]   But Andy has another recommendation.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.320]   Yes, it's called Billy Lynn's long half time walk.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:12.120]   It's a novel.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.120]   Really, really cool.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.560]   Francis recommended to me by my friend Bill Mack and his recommendations are always worth
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.560]   taking out.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.840]   In fact, you recommended Bill Mack's book.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:21.680]   Not so long ago on Secretary.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.400]   He's a legendary sports writer and especially a legend for horse racing.
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:30.800]   So he's a lot of he wrote something brand new about the Triple Crown for SI.com as always
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.280]   worth reading.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:41.400]   This one is it's about this platoon, this group of soldiers who's fighting in Iraq and
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.440]   they get caught in this ferocious firefight.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:47.720]   And there's also an embedded Fox News camera crew with them.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.920]   So the footage goes absolutely international.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.960]   And the Bush administration says, Oh my God, this is this opportunity to everyone filled
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.200]   with love for these soldiers.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.280]   Let's bring them in and have them do a tour of the country to get more support for the
[00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:59.280]   war.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:03.080]   And so this is all this is like at the end of that two week tour of around the country.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080]   They're at there.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.080]   They're going to be walking out and being presented with whatever at the at a halftime
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.000]   show at Dallas Cowboys game.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.320]   And so this is like their last hurrah before they go back to Iraq.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:16.840]   So it's just one day on Thanksgiving and these people's lives that it's I've only read the
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.760]   first four chapters of it right now.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.120]   I've got it on Kindle, but it's already it's funny.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.120]   It's interesting.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.320]   It's insightful and it's I'm kind of eager to get to chapter five of it.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.080]   Billy Lynn's long halftime walk by Ben Fountain.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.920]   Well, can I have three choices?
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:37.640]   By the way, what's awesome about this book and many of the books on audible.com is it's
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.560]   whisper sync for voice ready.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.440]   And that means if you get the Kindle edition of it and you get a discounted version of
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.880]   the Kindle edition and they just did this on iOS, it's been a this is so exciting.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.920]   And you use the Kindle reader on iOS.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.160]   You can take up where you left off.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.400]   You can be listening to the book, then go to the Kindle app and open the book and I'll
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:00.160]   start at that page so you can mix and match reading and listening.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.400]   I think it's really cool.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400]   He tried.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.400]   What a great idea.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.160]   This is this is whisper sync for voice ready.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:12.160]   So another another great feature of audible.com and they just updated the the mobile apps for
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.440]   Kindle to support this before you had to have an actual Kindle to do it.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.520]   So this is really, really great.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.520]   All right.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.920]   So you might say, all right, I'm sold.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:26.360]   I'd like to find out more about listening to audio books at work at school.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.720]   Walk cleaning while walking the dog.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.840]   You know where I listen in the gym, the most boring thing in the world, the treadmill,
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.840]   not anymore.

[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.480]   And then after 30 days, if you don't like it, you cancel.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.040]   You pay nothing for the first 30 days.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.880]   And you keep the book, by the way, but if you decide to stick around, you're going to
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:36.400]   hear our recommendations on almost every show because we love talking about it.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.400]   And you'll find that that's true.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.720]   When you meet people, you know our audible listeners, you got lots to talk about.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720]   It's so much fun.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.120]   Audible.com/macbreak for your free book.

[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   Assuming we get an Apple TV refresh asks Curtis in Utah in the US of A, do we assume
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.320]   it will run full iOS 8?
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.000]   Everybody still wants everybody still wants the apps, but he's more interested in hand
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.160]   off to his TV.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.760]   Well, he didn't discuss handoff to media at all yet.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.000]   That's probably going to be the subject of a fall talk, but I would be happy with one
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   that just runs metal really well.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.720]   Put an M8 in there and metal and that's the obvious target for metal one.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.080]   And I saw the point handoff would be great if if I'm like, if I come in from a car,
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.320]   if I come in from the library, whatever and I've got, I won't watch something on Netflix,
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:35.000]   the ability to simply hand off that video to Apple TV without having to open up a player,
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.040]   without having to tap on airplay, without having to do this, that the other, if it's
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.480]   just simply smart enough to say, oh, I see that there is, I see that thanks to the fact
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:46.080]   that that your Apple TV is also an Ibekan, I see that you're within four feet of an Apple
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080]   TV.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.280]   So I'm going to simply let you throw this video right to the screen.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   That seems so sensible.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.480]   In fact, other devices that already do that.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.480]   Right?
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.480]   And I can't do anything.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.480]   I think we saw it.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.680]   You did HomeKit to make the TV turn on first, right?
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.000]   It's again, it's the conjunction of all these things.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.200]   I pray that they make this home automation work.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.800]   I just, I'm ready.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.480]   I've always wanted to do total home automation and I've dabbled in it with Hugh and Sonos
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:16.240]   and, but I am ready to have the whole house totally controlled from an iPhone, but you
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.640]   got to make this happen and it's got to be a standard and I will, I will spend a thousand
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   bucks.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   Oh, wow.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640]   I will do whatever.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   It'll be very expensive.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.960]   You'll have to buy a hub probably, right?
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.400]   And the vices that work with a hub.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.240]   Well, and I think that one of the things that I started thinking about the watch more
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   and one of the things about the watch is when you have it on, it's going to tell you where
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240]   what room you're in.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.120]   So the lights turn on, the door locks as you leave the, you know, so the thing is it doesn't
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.360]   have to do a lot more than that.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:45.640]   If you go to the Bill Gates mansion, every person has some sort of identifier that they're
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   walking around with.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:52.040]   And when you go into a room, the high res screens in the wall, and this was 15 years ago,
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.000]   would have paintings that you liked would come up and it would, so it would reprogram
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.920]   all the screens in the room.
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.520]   That's the kind of thing we're talking about.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.760]   Well, and I think that like you, you can look at behavioral stuff like if I sit down, if
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.320]   I sit down at the couch, I know that you want to watch the TV.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320]   So I'm going to turn it on.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.320]   I'm going to turn it on.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.800]   You know, I'm going to take you to your favorite shows that you're watching.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.800]   I can, you know, show you some kind of interface.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:16.080]   There's a lot of those kinds of things that were very, very sci-fi only a couple years
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:21.040]   ago that will probably be very, very normal, not that many years in front of us, you know,
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.040]   like Scarlett Johansson.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.040]   Oh, I can't wait.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.040]   She's that little giggle in the breath.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:35.040]   She's so, if you watch her, you could see how Joaquin Phoenix could fall in love with
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.040]   her.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.840]   She's so adorable, right?
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.840]   Right.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.240]   I can't wait.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.640]   It's going to happen when I'm in the home, which is good.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.640]   Right.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.720]   You know, I'll be in the nursing home and I'll, I don't have a little.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.720]   With your OS girlfriend?
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720]   My OS girlfriend.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   And I'll be happy.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.800]   Oculus Rift visit Paris helmet on.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800]   Yes.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.800]   It's going to be great.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.040]   With one of those, you can walk anywhere, like you can just kind of.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.800]   I'm going to Paris with Scarlett Johansson.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.800]   Nice.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.520]   That's my, that's my goal for the retirement home.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.080]   I'll be sledding with Hobbes.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.400]   That'd be good too.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.400]   That'd be good too.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.400]   I take that.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.440]   John Patchkowski, I don't know how he knows.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440]   Here we are in June.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:16.000]   He says, yes, Apple's first wearable device is slated for October.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.360]   How does John know that?
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.560]   You okay?
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.240]   You know, people familiar with Apple's plans.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.120]   And that's the scuttlebutt.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.120]   This tells Code Red, the company helps to schedule a special event in October to show
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.120]   off the device.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.120]   Well, yeah.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.200]   I mean, you don't have to ask somebody September iPhone, October iPad.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.480]   I mean, that's how they do it anyway.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480]   Right.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.480]   There's definitely not going over the summer.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.440]   I mean, you know, that's not, there's no reason for that.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:46.040]   You know, they're going to, I mean, they might, I think that we might see some hardware
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.200]   computer-wise happen over the summer, but I think that they're, you know, obviously
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.760]   the big push is going to be for Christmas.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.800]   And so they're going to have what we're going to see are the big upgrades, I think,
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.600]   in maybe late August, but that late August to mid October, I think, is the window that
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.760]   we're going to see a lot of announcements consumer-wise.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:05.960]   The Nikkei says it's also not only is it going to be in October, but the Nikkei says, which
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.800]   I guess it was that Japanese newspaper, says it's going to produce Apple plans to produce
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.880]   five, three to five million units a month this fall.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.880]   So they're going to, that's going to sell well.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.360]   Gee, that's, it's, it's, it doesn't, it sounds low though.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.880]   Or at least it sounds like an expensive product.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:25.280]   If that, if that is true, if we're, we're, we're talking about hypotheticals here, but
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.160]   if they're trying to sell three to, if they think they're only going to sell three to
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:33.600]   five million of these worldwide, that suggests that it won't, it wouldn't be like a $99 fitness
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.480]   ban, which they would might be able to just sell out as many as they could possibly make.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:44.280]   This iPhone 5S add features the Wahoo fitness blue SC speed cadence sensor, the Y things
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:51.680]   health mate, the ZEP golf sensor, the misfit shine and the Adidas my coach smart ball.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:57.120]   That's how many devices are wearable devices are seen in this one ad.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.680]   And of course at the very end, you see the woman running by with the iPhone on her wrist.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.520]   I don't think that, I don't know her bicep.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.160]   I don't think that that's, this is pre health kit too.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.960]   This is, this is an older ad, right?
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:12.840]   And I've been thinking about a lot about in the gym, a lot about the future integration
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.920]   with exercise, you know, where I walk up to a, whatever I'm doing and it's keeping tracking
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.600]   again, like when you're looking at how much, how many reps you're doing, all those things
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.840]   are a lot easier to track with a, with a wristwatch.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:28.040]   Can I, yeah, but can I just point out that Microsoft has said at E3 that they're going
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:32.880]   to build connect into the next Windows phone, you know, right now when you work out in front
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.840]   of your Xbox one, the connect senses muscle activity because it's got infrared sensing
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.120]   heart rate.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:46.600]   It actually tunes your exercise to its image of you, its infrared image of you and says
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.520]   you need to work harder on that area.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.960]   Well, let's do more of those knee lifts.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.040]   Imagine if that were in the phone, right?
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.640]   Like an airport scanner, Macy.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.240]   I think by the key difference is that the iPhone is the iPhone and the Windows phone
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.240]   is Windows phone.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.520]   That's on the most popular phone in the world.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.840]   That means that everybody's going to support it.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.880]   Well, and I, and again, I can see myself working, you know, being able to like walk up to a
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.320]   machine, see videos on how to use that machine.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:15.200]   I mean, if you look at the me coach software, there are, you know, hundreds of, of animations
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:21.680]   of exactly how to produce from experts, like two experts, motion capture of how to produce,
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.960]   you know, all these different exercises.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:28.240]   And the next step from there is to measure how many you actually did and exactly what
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.280]   weight you used and all those, all those other things and being able to, you could get to
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.440]   a point where you just do the workout and it just, all that information goes in and
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:41.240]   it doesn't need to know, you know, if everything is smart, if, if your dumbbells have, have
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:45.920]   Bluetooth, Ellie and, and all of the machines have all those and everything is, everything
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.160]   knows that I simply do my workout and I look down or even have something in there where
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.440]   it's a little thing going, pick up, you know, you're now going to do curls, pick up 35
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.200]   pounds, you know, you know, and, and that is, it's figured out in the next guy.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.480]   So you, you like being beaten up.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.480]   Well, I'm right.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.400]   Your video right now I'm just lifting.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.360]   I'm just, I'm just going to the gym.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.840]   So it's not, it's, it's, that's why I've been, I have more time to think about it because
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.080]   I'm, I'm resting 90 seconds.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.560]   So that's why I've been thinking about it.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.240]   I do want, you know, and I've had little laps that do, you know, you record your reps
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.640]   and there's too much of this type of time or is it.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.440]   Yeah, it should just do that.
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.320]   Like I should just be able to walk into the gym and then do it.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:28.600]   I see you've just done a 180 pound bench press, try 190.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.320]   Letting the next time, you know, and it's managing that and it's because, oh, you didn't,
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   you didn't hit that.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.840]   Cause I mean, that's the, all the decision process and I, you know, and if you, you know,
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:40.160]   that's by the way, that ad I just showed, I don't know, is that the, the last shy day
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.240]   at Apple is, is shifting its ads in house.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:50.800]   They've, they've hired, they're hiring as many as a thousand in house ad people to produce
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.320]   their own TV ads.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:59.440]   The Apple team made the iPad air ad as well as the Robin Williams dead poet society, write
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.600]   your own verse ad.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.600]   The internal team includes at least two people.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:10.200]   Apple stole from media or I'm sorry, hired away two people from media arts lab at TBWA
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.680]   unit that was designed just to serve iPhone.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.760]   So they're bringing these people in house.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:19.960]   You know, Ford did this for created team for to brought in the, the ad agencies that
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.080]   were writing the stuff out of house brought them into Ford.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:30.200]   And a lot of the print stuff, I mean, the stuff that you see all the stuff you see in
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200]   the store.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.920]   I mean, that's all been in house for a long time, you know, cause it's just, you know,
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.640]   it's top secret.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:43.980]   It has to lift with, you know, it has to deal, you know, really, really deal with all the
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:47.920]   minutiae that Apple goes through to produce anything.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:54.120]   One of the guys they brought in, I think we interviewed, he was at a widen, widen in
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.440]   Kennedy.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.720]   I think he did was part of the old spice campaign.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.560]   And then he went from there to do media arts lab and from there he's now in, in house,
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.000]   his name is, uh, uh, Tyler Wissnand.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.880]   He's going to lead the creative team.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.720]   These are good people.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.680]   Music director David Taylor, another wide and Kennedy guy, Bill Davenport.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.480]   So they're really a thousand people.
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.840]   It's just Apple's market.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.360]   Apple has always been the best at marketing, but now they're said this is a full court
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360]   press on market.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.200]   Well, it's always been that they've been very controlling about it.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.520]   Now they get to have ultimate control and the reality is it may not cost them any more
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.960]   than, you know, what it was doing before.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.840]   It's just, you know, so it looks like they did find their wallet for the marketing team.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.520]   I mean, that was a really small team.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.520]   A thousand people is a big growth.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:49.000]   That iPhone ad was produced by media arts lab that we just saw in the chicken fat.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.640]   We didn't play the song.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   You didn't want to play chicken fat.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   It was in the background.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.040]   It was kind of weird.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.120]   I think the audience wanted to hear chicken fat.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.640]   You can play it again if you want.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.640]   No, it's okay.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.640]   Apple's.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:06.960]   Oh, fucking, fucking, it's a strange song to play on a fitness commercial.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.280]   I must admit.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.840]   Let's just see how the Apple stock is doing.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.560]   The seven for one split happened.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.960]   So if you say, "Wow, Apple's only the hundred bucks."
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:20.400]   Well, that's because you get seven shares for every one share.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.000]   They're at 94.19.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   So they're doing okay.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.400]   In fact, let's look at the one month trend.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.200]   Yeah, they seem to be doing all right.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.520]   Well, and I think that I think that the number one reason to do this is not to make it more
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.280]   available for the consumer, which I don't like to do.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.280]   That's what they always say.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.600]   The price everybody could buy a share now.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:42.080]   The big thing is, is that Apple cannot become part of the Dow industrials.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.080]   You know, the index.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.080]   The stock over 700.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.080]   You know, it's, there's nobody over there.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.080]   The dollar comes through.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   Most of them are under 100.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.320]   And I think Apple would like to be part of that.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.320]   Right.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320]   Google do the same thing.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.320]   Yep.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.960]   But a seven for one split.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.760]   Apple went from $646 on Friday to $93 on Monday.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.760]   Right.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.160]   I have seven times zero shares.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.160]   It's amazing.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.160]   Yeah, me too.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.160]   Me too.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160]   You know what?
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160]   Seven times zero is zero.
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.960]   Oh, well.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:16.120]   I, you know, the last time I had Apple shares was before I covered Apple on a regular basis.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.480]   And I, they probably were $30 or $40 shares.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.640]   They probably were nothing.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.760]   I'd have been, I'd be rich today.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.760]   Rich.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.840]   And have we heard anything about Angela Arrens?
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:33.080]   None of the new people, we thought maybe we'd see, I guess, Dre made a phone call at
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.080]   WWDC.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.080]   We didn't see Jimmy Iovine.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.560]   We see the new head of retail Angela Arrens.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.280]   Have we heard anything from her or she just knows to the grindstone getting everything
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.280]   going?
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:48.120]   She, I think she'd be refreshing to see, you know, in a all-male presentation.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.720]   She's a really good presenter and a great speaker.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.800]   So there's not any reason why she shouldn't.
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.760]   But I imagine she's probably going to want to be doing what she's doing, improve what
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.160]   she's doing before she gets up and talks about it.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.080]   Like you want to talk about the Apple store under her when she's been doing it for while
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.680]   she'll come up and talk about what she's done with the store.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:06.680]   Right.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:11.680]   I would like to see more Jimmy Iovine.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.160]   He's unveiling all the tarps Leo.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.040]   All the tarps are off for him.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:27.360]   The patent troll, oh my God, the patent troll named Vernet X or Vernet X, they bought, of
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.160]   course they don't make anything, they bought patents.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.440]   They're only businesses enforcing those patents.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:43.040]   They sued Apple in East Texas, the jury in East Texas ordered Apple to pay $368 million
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:49.480]   for, for, in fringing, Vernet X's patents on FaceTime and VPN on demand.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.480]   Functions used to-
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.600]   Oh, I think the original patents had nothing to do with you through those.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.840]   No, no, that's usually the, what they, believe me, it's, they write the patents as broadly
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.000]   as they can.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.880]   And then they look for companies that infringed this super broad patent because it's software
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:05.080]   patents.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:12.680]   Then in March, the judge in the matter, Leonard Davis ordered an ongoing royalty of almost
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:22.560]   one percent of revenue from iPhones and iPads from Apple to Vernet X, one percent.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:26.040]   Apple is, of course, has been appealing this and fighting this.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:35.640]   A decision published last week says that Apple was pursuing a poor strategy.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:40.800]   It sounds like the judge wasn't too happy.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.160]   And it looks like Vernet X could start collecting this royalty pretty soon.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.040]   I really think that, I mean, we always complain about every time we talk about these patents,
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.480]   but I, you know, I just feel like someone needs to prove that they actually did something
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.480]   with the patent.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:57.800]   I think just thinking up the idea should not be enough or worse thinking up the idea than
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:02.320]   selling it many years later to another company that doesn't do anything but sue people.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.280]   Who determines FaceTime and VPN are worth one percent of?
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.760]   Like what are the other 99?
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.240]   That's a lot.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.920]   It's disgraceful.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.680]   By the way, Vernet X has reached licensing deals with any C Siemens in a via.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.120]   They won $200 million from Microsoft.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.840]   And even after doing that, they sued them again.
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:23.840]   Yep.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:29.480]   That's why we can't have nice standardized pay face time.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.480]   Really is a shame.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.320]   It really is a shame.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:38.520]   And by the way, other companies are challenging Vernet X saying, no, we have the.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.880]   And again, I mean, we've, we've started this before, but it just a reminder to the best
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.560]   this American lives were the whole thing about trolls to listen to them.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.760]   Like it's just, it's just a great, great pair because what they were done like a year
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.440]   to apart and so that you get this first piece and then you get what happened later.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.360]   It's really great.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.160]   Pressing.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.880]   Let's move on.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:12.920]   Um, you know, we've talked before about the, the first sale doctrine and the idea that
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:17.640]   when you buy stuff from Amazon and put it on your Kindle player, digital goods or from
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:23.760]   iTunes, music and movies, that you can't hand those down as you could to your heirs as
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.160]   you could a physical book or a DVD.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:34.200]   And so members of Congress have been investigating whether copyright law should be changed so
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:41.840]   that you could resell or lend out or in fact, will your digital goods to other people.
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.720]   But so far, this is not gone well.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.800]   Second hand, second hand, iPhone signals.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.480]   But I think in a lot of ways though, I think some of the things that the price is dropping
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.480]   a lot.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:55.200]   So while we can't hand it off, it's also much less expensive solution.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.720]   I don't think it, you know, I think now it's gone up.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:58.720]   Um, a little bit.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.720]   Who's gonna want my little DVDs?
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.720]   Nobody.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.720]   I could tell you right now.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.720]   Right.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:08.120]   On the other hand, books have a, have a real intrinsic value in my Oxford English dictionary,
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.600]   my, you know, 1999 world book and slightly the PDF, my collected edition.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.120]   But I think the question is, is this the laws wells?
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:20.240]   Do we really think the price is going to continue to remain what it is for digital goods down
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.240]   the road?
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:26.080]   You know, um, you know, I think that the, what we've seen in the app world is probably
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.440]   going to happen more as that market gets a lot wider.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.480]   I think that a lot of these things don't make sense when there's a handful of people.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.880]   But now that, you know, when you get to a point where there's a billion people buying,
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.880]   um, you know, digital books, the idea of making them less expensive at $2.99 or $3.99,
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.400]   I think starts to make more sense.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.760]   I think in the small, it's still relatively small market.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.520]   I mean, a majority, I think of what Amazon selling now, but it's still, you know, not
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.520]   a billion people.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.840]   Um, and the Netflix model kind of fixes this too, because you'll just have a subscription
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.240]   account that you get everything anyway.
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:58.000]   And then if you pass away, you found me as their own subscription account.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.120]   There's also the bounce that you get from creators who are suffering from subscription models
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:08.560]   like that, where if you can't necessarily give your digital copies of books and movies
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.360]   and whatever to other people, that does, if it forces you to buy another copy of it,
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.880]   that's not necessarily a horrible thing for a book author.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.440]   Well, that's why family sharing might not be so popular with authors, right?
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:22.080]   The idea that you, it's not, it's not even really popular with the developers because
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.880]   now it already developers are being forced into a market where you can't charge $10
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:31.160]   for an app, even the amount of how much it costs and how much, how good it is.
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.840]   Now they're saying that not only do I have to charge $2.99 for this, but I only get to
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.320]   sell one copy to a family if they're using family sharing.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.360]   That's that that's potentially two or three other sales that might be going off the window,
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.360]   especially with the game.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.760]   I mean, I think that that's an argument, but I think that the other side of that though,
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.520]   is you have a, what used to be a vibrant piracy market.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.840]   I mean, it's still vibrant to some degree, but not, not for this kind of stuff.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.400]   Well, also people are already doing it.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.520]   And of course, I mean, I've been doing it all along with a single Apple ID.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.520]   Right.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.560]   It's just this, I mean, this just makes it a little more easy to manage.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.560]   Right.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:07.400]   And if it, and it does also kind of push more developers into the in app purchase model,
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.280]   because if they're, if they're, if already they know that every person in this family
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:13.640]   is going to be essentially getting a free copy of my game or my app, you may as well
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:20.360]   try to sell them Apple ID tailored content that maybe won't escape from that, that jail.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.560]   And I don't, and I don't think we've really, and I think that some of that stuff is what
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:27.560]   I'm really interested in is this, the, the inter app stuff that we're talking about and
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:32.080]   how it could change also that all kinds of in app purchases that theoretically could
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.800]   happen, you know, between different applications, you know, because I think that one of the
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.360]   things that I've always felt with a lot of highly technical applications and, and, and
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.400]   like advocate or even stuff like Excel or Word is if you have this huge installed base,
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.000]   I don't think you should just be making money selling that, that one thing, Word or Excel
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.560]   or Photoshop or whatever, you should build an entire infrastructure that lets people sell
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.600]   the content, but also training where the training is really built in.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:57.600]   Because you're a flappy bird.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:58.600]   You're not going to do that.
[01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:02.400]   If you're not, you're not going to flappy bird Institute, a hundred, a dollar ninety nine
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.840]   or even free makes sense for flappy bird.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.840]   It just doesn't make sense for Photoshop.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.840]   Right.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.920]   You know, so the thing is, is that if you build an infrastructure where I can pay, I want
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:12.640]   to learn how to use the clone tool and I'm willing to pay six dollars to see a great
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:17.920]   tutorial from, you know, or whatever built in running my application.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.480]   I think there's a lot of opportunity there, but you know, I think that that's where developers
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.480]   need to be.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.280]   We'll developers raise prices and apps to be a response to this.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:29.640]   You there are there are already people who are making serious money, like quit my full
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:33.480]   time job money doing like Minecraft videos on YouTube.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.960]   So it's going to be it would be so difficult to be a developer to not only produce the
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.720]   actual app and support the app, but also produce the content for as an in app purchase that's
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:44.120]   going to compete with a free YouTube video.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.040]   Well, the thing is, is the Justin time training.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:49.320]   I mean, and I am thinking about a professional market where, you know, I need to know how
[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.320]   to do something.
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:56.240]   I mean, I the first twit that we did that I did, I told Leo that I could do a multi multi
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.520]   cam edit on a in Final Cut and got back to the office.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.520]   I had no idea.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.920]   I got to done that night.
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:04.840]   I didn't I didn't sleep.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.080]   But I what I did by four o'clock in the morning, it was done.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.240]   But I but it was like it was one of those things like, you know, like how do I do multi cam,
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.920]   you know, and and that I would have paid I would have paid $100 at that moment when I
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:18.800]   got back to watch some 10 minute thing that that showed me how to do it and actually ran
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.120]   the application.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.760]   And there's there's a, you know, there's not there's a lot of people that want to figure
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.400]   out how to do something Excel or whatever.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.640]   But it's it's it's a full it's it's a philosophical discussion that I don't know if I would I
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:34.400]   would feel a little bit weird if I know that you're as a developer, if Apple's motivation
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.960]   is let's make let's make sure this is as easy as possible.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.360]   People can really figure it out.
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:42.040]   The documentation we give away is really, really good.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:46.720]   And we'll also sell $100 to let you teach you how to do this.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.280]   These things you want to do.
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:52.280]   It's it's just it just seems more pure when you have to go to Linda for that.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.040]   I want Apple to make it make a training that is free.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.560]   But there's no there's no way that you're going to know how to do everything in Final
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.560]   Cut.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:00.960]   There's no way they're going to have to do everything in Photoshop.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.680]   Those are deep applications.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.880]   And I'm not talking about $100.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.240]   I'm saying that there are many times when I need to know how to use one feature and I
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.200]   be happy to pay $10 for that.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.680]   But you know, you know, even Caesar's wife must be beyond reproach.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.680]   And I think that you kind of cross that you like cross that line.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:19.240]   If again, I'm responsible for not only giving you a good experience with this app, but I'm
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:23.080]   also going to sell you content that will teach you how to do something that you can figure
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.080]   out on your own.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.080]   Was that a superman?
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.000]   Great Caesar's wife.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.960]   Well, but I but I think that I think that the thing is is that I think part of what makes
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:31.960]   the app better is training.
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:32.960]   I mean, I get I get you.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:33.960]   I get you.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.880]   You know, like that's the thing is, is it like, for instance, I don't same thing.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:41.160]   We say this all the time when people get dis-intermediate by the internet, you remedy
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:45.040]   it by providing service, providing value added in other ways.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.000]   It's just a way of rethinking your business model.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.560]   But you're saying, but I'll argue also for complex apps and even relatively simple apps.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.560]   But our hardware at home, again, the thing is, is that it increases the perceived value
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.720]   of that item because I know more about how to use it.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:04.960]   Like I bought my wife this crazy expensive microwave from Panasonic that and it's got
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.800]   all these features about a cook thing.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.800]   That's all these other things.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:10.800]   I'm telling you, that's not a good idea.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.800]   She loves it.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.800]   It wasn't from us.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.080]   I'm not known for giving gifts on the days.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.080]   I do those.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.080]   Yeah, that's really good.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.040]   I just decide she needs something and I bought it.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.040]   I'm surprised.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.280]   And so there was just a new microwave there that of course, I bought it because it was
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.280]   the nicest microwave I could find for my wife.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.760]   And all she does and all I do is there's this really great little dial that you turn that
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.280]   sets the time and then I start.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.800]   But if I knew how to do that stuff, but you open up the manual and it is the most, you
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:46.920]   know, a tooth, you know, opaque thing written by someone in Japan and then translated badly
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.960]   into English, you know, and you're just laying a piece of paper that you lose immediately.
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.960]   You need Scarlett Johansson.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:53.960]   Yeah, I can Scarlett Johansson did videos about how to use that.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960]   Are you trying to make it?
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:55.960]   I just think of the original.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:56.960]   Something like why is that so fancy?
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.960]   It's just got a lot of Panasonic.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:58.960]   That's an Anderson.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.960]   It's a Panasonic.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960]   Yeah, it's like that.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.960]   I mean, I don't think that that's the exact model.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:11.960]   It might be a little bit bigger than that one, but, um, but it's like that.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.720]   And it's just got a bunch of stuff, but all we know how to use is the dial and the dial
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:15.720]   does work really well.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.720]   It seems like all you need to use.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.720]   Great.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.200]   If it was Apple, that's all it would be.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.200]   And it would be a really nice.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.640]   They shouldn't have those other buttons.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.640]   It's just going to be a little bit.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.320]   I think Apple makes essentials grief to you.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.800]   You need two buttons, minute plus and start.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.320]   You know, Apple should make a microwave.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.320]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.960]   You know, there's just be a dial with a little button that you just push the dial in to set
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:36.960]   things.
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:37.960]   Spoon with a diamond champion.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   I buy it.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   They do.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   It's good.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960]   Then you can control with your iPhone.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.640]   Like, you know, tell you it beats microwave and because and because they had to be had to
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.800]   be flat and made out of one block of aluminum and all he does toast.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.840]   No, it would be a pizza.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.840]   That's what it would be.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.000]   What I realized is that everybody only does one thing with their microwave.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.480]   It was set the time.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.560]   It set the time and the and the and medium or whatever.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.920]   So they build one of those, but you tied into your iPhone.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.880]   So it tells you everything about the meat and all that, whatever on an app.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.720]   In fact, they make that an open eye API.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.480]   So people can just build an iPad.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.080]   I'm going to control the iPhone.
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.080]   The controls are very simple.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.080]   They have those.
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.040]   Going back to the question engine.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.400]   Any thoughts on photos, the Mac app to be released next year?
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.680]   Why did they announce it now?
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:26.000]   So early, will it replace I photo and maybe even app address movie Mac from Berlin, Doychlant?
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.800]   I don't know if it's going to replace that much about it, do we?
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.800]   No.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.480]   But I think that that's the direction that they're going is had to announce it because
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.000]   of the cloud stuff because you know, where your photo is going to go in the Mac was an
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   obvious question.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   Right.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.760]   And also it shows it's one feature that shows off so much of what iOS eight and in Yosemite
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.280]   do between the cloud sharing app between the proximity apps between it's it's just it's
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:48.680]   a good demo for everything.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.680]   All right.

[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.480]   One of the things and we're learning this now here at Twit as we work on our new website.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:29.640]   One of the things that really is hard to do is keep up with the web that what people
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.760]   expect the standards they change.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.760]   It feels like almost monthly.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.280]   But with squarespace, you don't have to worry about that.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.200]   They're incredibly talented designers and developers.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:45.240]   Make sure that your website is gorgeous that it works perfectly that lives up to all the
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.240]   modern web standards.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:51.200]   For instance, mobile responsive design, your site will look great no matter what size screen.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.280]   e-commerce is built into every single template.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:57.680]   Twenty five designer templates, that's where you start.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.600]   They lose the latest technologies, beautifully written code.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:05.520]   But then you get to point and click drag and drop move without even if you don't know anything
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.640]   about CSS or JavaScript, create a gorgeous website.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.520]   And by the way, if you do know about CSS and JavaScript, they have a developer platform
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.520]   that's stunning.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.120]   It's just brilliant.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.880]   I want you to visit squarespace.com.

[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.960]   I think they do this just to show, hey, we can develop on any platform.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:49.960]   They've got the blog app which lets you post and moderate comments, post articles, modify
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.280]   your site from your iPhone or your iPad.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.840]   The metrics app which lets you check follows even on social media, things like that.
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.160]   There's a portfolio app.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.120]   There's even a note taking app.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:05.200]   They really are so talented in what they do.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:10.560]   The portfolio app is a simple white labeled app that will synchronize with the galleries
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.400]   on your squarespace site.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:18.880]   So if you're a photographer, you can create the squarespace site, create the portfolio,
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:25.360]   and then use a portfolio app to showcase your work even without an internet connection.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.680]   This is a really sweet idea.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.840]   I can't tell anybody to go.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.840]   These guys are great.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.000]   Hey, go to squarespace.com.

[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.440]   so good.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:15.560]   Congratulations to my friends at Squarespace for Webby Awards this year.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.400]   I don't know if they're going to build another shelf just to hold the Webby Awards.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.680]   Squarespace.com is the offer code MAC break and now it's time for a picks of the week.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.800]   Let's start with the expensive guy, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:29.320]   I was going to do something cheap, but now that you said expensive, right?
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:31.720]   You know, I could go the other way.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.360]   Oh, no, no, this is cheap.
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.000]   Okay, I'll go both directions.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000]   All right, you get to.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.880]   All right, and there's stuff that's just, I think that I've talked about in the past.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:44.080]   So it's not, they're not brand new, but they are things to remind people that haven't
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.000]   heard it, that they're worth playing with.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.360]   Number one is one that we actually help develop, but it's free now and you can get it.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.680]   A lot of people ask us how we do live.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.320]   We did a green screen class and we kept on getting asked over and over again.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.880]   So I realized that some people haven't heard of it.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:58.360]   It's called Pixel Conduit.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:01.200]   So, is that DV Garage or is that?
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:06.400]   It was DV Garage, but we worked with Lacker Effects to do it, Polly.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.760]   And it's called Pixel Conduit.
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.960]   If you do, yeah, there you go, Pixel Conduit.
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:12.200]   It's free.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:15.920]   And for about, I think it's $20, you can actually get a web interface.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:20.640]   You can actually go in, do a green screen and pass it off to hang out.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:26.480]   So it's a great little app that does lots and lots of Swiss Army knife for visual effects.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.720]   But just video processing.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.440]   We use it for the scopes.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.520]   We use it for a lot of other things.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.040]   We never really figured out the business model that made it totally work.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.560]   And so we just, Polly decided to make it available to everyone.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.920]   And there's just, I mean, you cannot believe the kind of tools that are built into this
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.960]   thing, stuff that I don't even know how to use.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.480]   Because he was doing lots of live stuff.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.480]   And it's just what I want.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:46.640]   Stuff you don't know how to use.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:49.600]   There's stuff that there's scopes and there's green screen and there's all kinds of other
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.200]   things that I use on a day to day basis.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:57.240]   But there's all kinds of other image blending and, you know, crazy math and the ability to
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.240]   drop stuff in.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:01.000]   And so all of that stuff is stuff that you can download.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.440]   So just download it and play with it.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.520]   It does stereo green screen compositing.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520]   Just in case you're wondering, we needed that for something.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.800]   But we use it every day.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:12.160]   And I just, you know, when people were asking a lot during one of my classes, I thought
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.560]   I'd bring it back up again.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:14.960]   So that's the free thing.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.680]   And the other thing is just, you know, there's a new version out and we love it even more.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.360]   And I know you guys use it here.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:25.480]   But I just, you know, the two things that you want to think about when you're thinking
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:27.480]   about live streaming is wirecast.
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:28.480]   If you're doing software.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:29.480]   We use it all the time.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.600]   Wirecast is the best thing to get started with.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:34.120]   It does a lot of things that are great.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:40.720]   When you go to an industrial scale, you know, elementals are, we have a lot of them now.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.840]   I think we have a, I think we have 16.
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:46.840]   How much are those elementals, Alex?
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:51.680]   I think that the ones that we have are somewhere between 12 and 25,000.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.960]   It depends on what you're getting.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:55.960]   But they're great.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:59.160]   The worst of the deal is that it's just like we had an issue yesterday with the stream
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:04.480]   and the ability to jump in, manage something quickly and get out, you know, and have it
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.080]   go is just amazing.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:11.360]   So, but the both of them are great applications and obviously Wirecast is a little more affordable
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.360]   and more flexible.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.680]   You can do editing with it.
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:18.000]   We figured out how to get, you know, four cameras into a laptop and edit them all and
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.800]   add graphics and video and everything else.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.400]   And so as a Swiss Army knife, it's great.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:24.240]   But a lot of people ask me that question, so I thought I'd bring it up.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.240]   That's all.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.240]   Good one.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.640]   Good one.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.760]   And we use Wirecast for like some special effects.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:34.040]   Things that TriCaster can do, I'm sure, but it's just easier to use Wirecast.
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:36.440]   When you do it on any laptop, you know, that's the big thing.
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:39.320]   And there's a, there's a free version for you to stream to YouTube.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:42.920]   So you can download it for free and use it that does lots of great basics.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:43.920]   For YouTube live.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.920]   Yeah, for YouTube live.
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:47.040]   Remember, you do a hangouts with it.
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.240]   People do use it for hangouts.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.920]   We use a lot of hardware for that.
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:52.240]   People will use it to add effects and then pass it into a hangout.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:57.040]   It's got its own little web tool that will let hangouts and a couple other things.
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.040]   Not Skype.
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.080]   The new Skype is pretty smart about not letting you put anything professional into it because
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.840]   they want to sell you something else.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:10.960]   But anyway, but it's, you know, Wirecast is, you know, we use it a lot on the road.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.640]   It's the thing that we use as our backup for our elementals.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:18.800]   It's the thing we use when someone, you know, has a lower budget, more corporate or educational,
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.520]   you know, type of thing.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.880]   And it's just a great, great application.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:24.880]   Andy, thank you.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.320]   Andy and Aco, your pick of the week.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.320]   It's a really great utility called Wi-Fi Explorer that you're probably familiar with.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:38.560]   It's the most soul sucking diagnostic you have to do is figure out why your Wi-Fi.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:40.680]   If you're using Wi-Fi, why does something drop out?
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:41.760]   Why is something screwing up?
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.880]   Why is an app suddenly disconnecting and reconnecting?
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.720]   And Wi-Fi Explorer is a really easy $2.99 utility.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:52.920]   That will, I mean, that will just simply show you graphs and show you what your Wi-Fi network
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:55.000]   is doing at any given moment.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.400]   And it will also, so if, for instance, just last week, I chat or messages, for some reason
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.880]   would keep brandably disconnecting and reconnecting.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.320]   I thought, okay, is it a signal problem?
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.840]   And it would have been difficult to figure that out ordinarily, but all I have to do
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:14.400]   is leave this thing running as soon as I get an audio signal that this, that I chat has
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:15.400]   lost the connection.
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:19.480]   I can just check that graph and see that, okay, nope, the Wi-Fi connection was stable.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:20.760]   It must be something else.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:26.040]   But you can also do things like take a look at every single Wi-Fi source that is visible
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.480]   to your computer.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:30.040]   You can see what the signal to noise ratio and your signal is.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:35.720]   You can see if there are other things, other devices that are trying to hog the Wi-Fi bandwidth.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:40.080]   And it's a really quick way to have, just get your eyeballs on what's happening in the
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:43.120]   Wi-Fi spectrum around your house.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:47.920]   And you also, sometimes you have no idea how many Wi-Fi devices you actually have inside
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.960]   your house or next door to you until you run this app.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.760]   You say, oh, that's a lot of devices.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:58.960]   Oh, my neighbor bought a new printer and it's trying to grab.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.160]   It's using the same channel as my main base station is.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.720]   That could be a problem.
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:10.240]   So it's a really egalitarian tool because if you're a professional, you might be using
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:15.080]   this tool to, again, once you hit a client's office to see what's going on and easily
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:20.200]   spot a problem in what might take other people hours and hours to do, if you're not an expert,
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.720]   it will just give you a quick thumbs up, thumbs down.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.200]   Are you losing signal?
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.080]   Do you have a good strong signal?
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:31.240]   Are there other devices in range that are trying to hog the same channels?
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:34.880]   It's a very, very quick way to solve very simple problems.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.880]   299.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:36.880]   Wi-Fi Explorer.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:37.880]   Yeah, it's a must-have.
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:39.720]   And it's in the app store.
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:40.720]   Yes.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:44.000]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, what's your pick of the week?
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000]   Mine is super quick.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.760]   It's the RSS reader on red.
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.040]   It's a very simple, very elegant RSS reader and the iPad version just came out yesterday.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.040]   I bought it.
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:53.040]   So if you've enjoyed it.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.200]   Love the new Mac version.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:55.200]   Love it 2.0.
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:00.480]   And so if you use it on the iPhone, you want to use it on your iPad, it's just unread.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:03.480]   If you're still, if you are still into RSS and you should be, then it's a great way to
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.480]   do it.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.480]   Yep.
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.880]   And, oh, you're trying to unread.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:08.880]   Okay.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.480]   I just got reader for the app store.
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:13.280]   2.0 just came out.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.160]   Do you like reader on the desktop?
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.160]   I do.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.280]   Reader 2 is, I guess maybe I'll make that my pick.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.080]   I was going to show you a whole bunch of ways to watch the World Cup online.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:29.360]   But since you did unread for the iPad, let's keep RSS alive.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.720]   Even though apparently Apple's decided to do that too.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:32.720]   No.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:33.720]   Which is kind of shocked.
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.200]   Maybe you wonder what they have planned.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:36.200]   This is 10 bucks.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.200]   But boy, is it great.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.440]   It's just like bringing back Google Reader.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.400]   You can sign into your feeder or other feeds.
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.200]   It's what I use now to go through all the news.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.200]   It's really great.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.400]   And 2.0 just came out for $10, unfortunately.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.640]   That's a good thing, Leo.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.640]   Supporting the book.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:54.480]   It's worth it.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:55.480]   It's well worth it.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.200]   They're really great.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.040]   I was going to give you a little tip because, you know, ESPN, you can watch the World Cup
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.600]   at start Wednesday, tomorrow, right?
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.920]   Where's the tomorrow or next Wednesday?
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:09.240]   And this Wednesday, tomorrow, US doesn't play till next week.
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.440]   But this is the first time I've ever been in the country when the World Cup is.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:14.480]   I always like somewhere watching it actually where people are in the--
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:15.480]   Where they care.
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:16.480]   Where they care.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.480]   And it's so much.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:20.400]   I mean, it's just this cultural thing that as Americans we often miss out on.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.680]   But it's a lot of fun.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:26.160]   There's a lot to-- you know, even though I'm not a huge soccer fan three years out of
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.160]   the four--
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.160]   I don't understand off sides.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:29.160]   Come year four-- I understand.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.160]   I'll explain to you.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.840]   Come year four, the World Cup, it just makes me so excited.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.480]   I was so sad when the World Cup ended last time in South Africa.
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.480]   Spain won.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:40.480]   US did all right.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.480]   I think they're going to do even better this time.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:47.400]   But whatever country you're in, if you are in the US, ESPN is a sucky way to watch it.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.640]   They haven't watched ESPN app, but your cable company has to support it.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.640]   Direct TV does not.
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:52.640]   What?
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:55.840]   It's that same thing with HBO Go where you log in with your cable account.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:58.080]   Yes, I could prove I have cable.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.880]   So if you're a court cutter, get you-- now you have to understand Spanish.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:02.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.280]   But soccer's better in Spanish anyway.
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.480]   They're not saying any to you.
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.080]   Univisions, day port or desk porter-- I don't know what you're probably pronouncing--
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:16.360]   the Potece app will-- without logging into your cable company or anything, let you watch
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.000]   the World Cup in Spanish.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.400]   Now you can set the app itself to English, which is great.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.960]   But the game will be obviously in Spanish.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:31.880]   However, I think as long as you can see what's going on, it doesn't really matter, right?
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:32.720]   Yes.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:34.720]   And I'll tell you something.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:35.720]   [SINGING]
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:38.720]   Any language is the same thing.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:39.720]   [SINGING]
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:40.720]   I'll just wait until they're all clapping.
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.720]   [SINGING]
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:42.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:43.720]   [SINGING]
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:44.720]   So--
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.720]   [SINGING]
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:47.720]   Football.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.720]   Univision de Portes.
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:51.720]   You must get it.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:52.720]   You must get it.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.720]   And we will all be watching.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.720]   And it's free.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.720]   And it is on the iPad.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:59.720]   And as far as I can tell, you don't have to sign up with your cable cup or anything.
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.720]   They're just going to have the games.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.720]   That's great.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.720]   And they're great.
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:03.720]   In Spanish.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:08.720]   I think most other countries are probably allowing this, but it's just in the US.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:09.720]   They're so excited.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:10.720]   They're--
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:11.720]   --cometary is amazing.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.720]   Yeah, I almost prefer-- even though I don't understand the Spanish very well, I kind of
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.720]   understand it.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.720]   I'd prefer to watch out because they get so excited.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:20.720]   [SINGING]
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:21.720]   [SINGING]
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:22.720]   [SINGING]
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:23.720]   [SINGING]
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.720]   [SINGING]
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.720]   I think someone's about--
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:26.720]   Or Scottish.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.720]   That's the rule.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:28.720]   Scottish would be good.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.720]   Yeah, I should check and see if the Scottish National Network--
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:31.720]   I might have the same trouble.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:34.720]   I actually understand what was going on as I would with Spanish.
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.720]   Did you see John Oliver's takedown of FIFA on Sunday on--
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:39.720]   Oh my god.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:41.720]   FIFA is so corrupt.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.720]   They're so corrupt, I think.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.720]   I didn't see what he said.
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:45.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.720]   He went all out.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.720]   That was a whole new level of what the--
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:56.720]   Yeah, because I guess the next-- in eight years, the World Cup is going to be in a country
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:57.720]   that actually doesn't--
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:00.720]   That 4,000 people will die between now and then just to build the stadiums.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:01.720]   That's the only place soccer.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:02.720]   Right.
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.720]   Yeah, but also, again, people dying who are building these stadiums.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:13.720]   And Brazil, where the FIFA has the power to basically create its own laws saying that we have--
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.720]   for the last one, that they had their own police force essentially, and somebody who caused
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:22.720]   a disruption was arrested on Wednesday, tried on Thursday, and started a 20-year jail sentence on Friday.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.720]   Hey, we believe in--
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.720]   It's like a--
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.720]   Excelerated access to justice.
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:28.720]   That was--
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.720]   Yeah, I'm out of dawn.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.720]   I'm out of dawn.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.720]   Certainly faster than the goal scoring in any of their games.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.720]   Boom!
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:41.720]   Do they-- do they, in Montreal, I would imagine that soccer is a fairly important sport in Montreal.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.720]   We have the Montreal Impact.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.720]   I mean, I know-- we have very few sports teams now, so we guard them jealously.
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:46.720]   Right.
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.720]   We don't want Americans to steal them and make them into champions.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:50.720]   I'm just going to sign into this Univision's--
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.720]   We lost the Nordique.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.720]   We lost the Expose.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.720]   We lost the Royals.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.720]   It's right.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:57.720]   The Expose and the Royals, I remember them.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.720]   Oh, well.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.720]   Still, my favorite-- I've always been a fan of the Bruins, but if I have to pick up the greatest
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:06.720]   name in professional hockey, it's the Quebec Nordiques.
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.720]   The Nordique.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:08.720]   I just love that name.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:09.720]   Nordique.
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.720]   Vivaleno-Diques.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.720]   Even better than the Maple Leafs.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.720]   I think.
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:15.720]   Leaves.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:16.720]   Leafs.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:18.720]   And they became what the avalanche, right?
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:19.720]   Oh, that's so true.
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:20.720]   Started winning.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:24.720]   And then, I'm going to go ahead and insult the injury.
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:26.720]   All right, my friends, we are done.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.720]   We are done.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:28.720]   We have cooked it.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.720]   It is cooked.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:30.720]   Well cooked.
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.720]   Well cooked.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:34.720]   We do the show every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.720]   1800 UTC on Twit.tv.
