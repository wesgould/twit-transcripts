[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.640]   to show that covers all the stuff out of Apple.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.480]   There's a lot to talk about today, so we brought in the A team.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.440]   An unusual team that is very rarely altogether for a show.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.240]   I could tell that Andy and I was trying to whistle the A team's
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.400]   theme but couldn't remember it.

[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I am so sorry.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   [LAUGHTER]

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   They're very similar.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.640]   No, that's not landing.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.640]   We need to cover a lot of bad TV on this.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.640]   Not landing.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.560]   Please don't hum the not-s landing theme when we come on.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.360]   To my left, Mr. Alex Lindsey, he's in studio with us today
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.560]   from the pixelcore.com, soon to be located right next to me.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.720]   I mean, when we say soon, we mean the next four days.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.120]   You're moving in before we are.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.920]   All right, the moving trucks are coming.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.360]   Our last day in San Francisco is this Saturday.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   Well, you're not going to keep a skeleton crew down there?
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.040]   We decided not to.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.840]   Because of the payroll tax thing?
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.480]   That was a contributing factor.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.160]   So San Francisco is not a great place to have a business.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.320]   It's cheap to be in Petaloma.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.440]   We're getting a very good rent.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.680]   And we love having you next door.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.840]   So Alex, the pixelcore will occupy-- actually, you're
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.000]   going to also get a space elsewhere.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.880]   Your studio space will be right next to-- in our studio
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.440]   building.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.240]   Yeah, we love--
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.560]   I'm really excited about having everything up in Petaloma.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.360]   I like them.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.160]   I'm very excited.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.560]   And if you're a tech company, we
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.560]   would love to have you in Petaloma.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   We're looking at Twitter.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.800]   When I saw Twitter, like not sure if they were going to stay,
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.080]   I was like, we should say Twitter should move to Petaloma.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.600]   Yes, they should.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.960]   It would be really great.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.120]   Then we could have Twitter and Twitter.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.560]   And it would really confuse people.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.720]   The same address.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.560]   Yes, we're the Petaloma Twitter.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.120]   Oh, no.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.920]   That doesn't solve it.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.000]   So Alex Lindsey's here.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.560]   So is Andy Inato from the Chicago Sun Times?
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.080]   And it looks like he's got a picture of grandpa in Nato.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   If you were behind him there.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.360]   That's nice.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.640]   That's not grandpa inato.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.080]   That's Neil Gaiman.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   New York Times, multiple best-selling author.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.360]   And currently, you're idle.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.360]   And you're tight.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.120]   Apparently, you're idle.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.280]   We're collaborating on a future project.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.600]   Stay tuned for details.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.320]   I got to introduce this other guy.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.880]   I'm sorry, Andy.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.280]   I didn't mean to cut you off.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.800]   No, no, no.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.880]   I was just being quiet.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.200]   Again, I'm just as excited about the other guy,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.840]   as you call her for the inferno.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.480]   Yes, it's ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.760]   Irfan Elijah was from the cult of Mac.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.200]   Hello.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.560]   Thank you for having me on the show.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.840]   Great to have you.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.400]   I'm honored to be the other guy.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.320]   The other guy.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.520]   Well, at least you're not wearing a red shirt, are you?
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.640]   No, not today.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.480]   All right, Bay's shirt guy.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.200]   He usually gets it in the end, too, doesn't he?
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.560]   Welcome.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.160]   It's good to have you.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.880]   Cult of Mac, of course, that great blog and website
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.360]   all about Macintosh.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.080]   And that's what the show is all about.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.400]   So we've got four Mac experts, two of them in plaid shirts,
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.000]   unaccountably.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.080]   For those of you watching our video, I don't know what happened.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.640]   We're in Petaluma.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.920]   It looks like Farmer John and his brother.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.520]   We just had the butter and eggs.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.760]   Butter and eggs parade was today.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.080]   It was this weekend.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.480]   Oh, that's what that's what that's
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.640]   we're going to see more and more of.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.240]   Like, as you keep building up this new new twin building,
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.600]   everybody starts to dress out of the same laundry hamper.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.800]   I got a pitchfork.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.280]   That's true.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.040]   We--
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.800]   People have asked, we are going to have a fundraiser.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.520]   We're going to sell bricks with your name or whatever you want.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.640]   He's poisoned.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.040]   And we'll be putting those in the entryway.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.200]   As people come in the door, they'll
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.600]   see your name, unless it's on the ground, in which case,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.960]   they'll--
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.520]   How much are the bricks?
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.720]   I want a brick.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.560]   I think we're going to do $100 for the brick.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.360]   I'm buying one.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.840]   And then, well, we have other stuff.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.000]   We're going to have some other things to give away, too,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.760]   including an auction to name my studio.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.480]   Now, there's a whole big studio space,
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.880]   but my studio, which is a reinventing of this studio.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.760]   We're actually taking this studio
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.920]   and transplanting it to the--
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.960]   It's going to be the Oracle Center with Leo Le Port.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.720]   And we can name anything you want.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.920]   So we're having an auction.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.520]   It doesn't have to be a corporate name.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.760]   I'm just imagining the PNC--
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.320]   You could-- the PNC Twitter goddess.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.480]   Somebody who really doesn't like me could actually--
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.560]   Leo's a big fat jerk.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.720]   Leo's a big fat jerk.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.200]   And I will say, every day, when we begin the shows--
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.960]   and now coming to you from the--
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.480]   Leo is a big fat jerk studio.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480]   He goes--
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.040]   I'll start submitting it $50 for the place
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.320]   where truth goes to die.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.920]   There you go.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.640]   That's good.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.480]   Live from the place where truth comes goes to die.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   And you'll look for it.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.640]   All right, come back, break the--
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.400]   That would be good.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.360]   And so we're going to have a little bidding for that.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.920]   But the whole idea really is that we want everybody
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.040]   to have a chance to contribute to this.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.720]   The good news is that we have found sufficient financing
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.960]   to complete this studio.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.760]   There's always a good thing.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.120]   So we will actually be--
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.880]   I think mid-June.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.200]   I think we're about six weeks off.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.400]   We had a big meeting yesterday.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.000]   I gave the buy signal for 20 cameras.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.920]   The wiring guys are coming in.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.360]   The power guys are coming in.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.880]   There was a lot of go, go, go.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.920]   There was a little armed--
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.440]   No, no, no.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.280]   They were in the bath--
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.800]   Yeah, they were in the bath with drills.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.400]   A little lots are going--
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   So I think it's getting pretty historic.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.000]   As you start to see it build, I mean, it is--
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.440]   It's exciting.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.280]   It's like this is really going to be a TV network or something.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.920]   It could be a TV network, but like a real like--
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.120]   This is the next generation.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.040]   I think so.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.640]   It's a bit of an audacious plan.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.040]   Yes.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.360]   But I'm loving it.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.400]   And I'm really glad.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.560]   I'm very grateful, in fact, to you for being--
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.320]   I'm excited to be there.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.600]   I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.960]   Although, yeah, I thought I was going to beat you
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.680]   and be ready, you know, like a month and a half before you.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.640]   But I think we're going to be ready about the same time you are.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.960]   We have--
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.960]   You were cocky, weren't you?
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.320]   I was cocky.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.560]   So you can't really tell what's going on here.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.200]   It looks like there's a barrel full of nails.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.760]   I don't know what's--
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.840]   It's kind of quiet right now.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.960]   I think maybe it only gets busy when we go in the door.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.920]   And then after we leave, they go--
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.760]   They have a Leo Cam.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.880]   Oh, great time.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.160]   Yeah, the Leo Cam.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.000]   They don't know we have a Twitch studios cam.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.160]   So Apple, the big story right after we got off the air,
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.400]   well, the next day, Apple had its earnings call
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.080]   and had the most phenomenal--
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.680]   It seems like this is a broken record.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.280]   Every quarter.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.360]   Every quarter has been phenomenal.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.640]   Sales-- sales were almost double.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.560]   82% increase over this time last year.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.760]   Sales of $24.67 billion.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.560]   The profit did almost double.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.160]   95% increase in profit.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.200]   $6 billion in the bank--
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.640]   In the bank.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.640]   --its three months in the bank profit in your pocket.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.720]   Phenomenal success.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.120]   iPhone sales up 113%.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.240]   With the Verizon.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.360]   Well, now, this was a year ago.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.880]   So this was iPhone-- this was pre-iPhone 4.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.400]   Was the tail end of the iPhone 3GS.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.160]   So that's maybe not surprising.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.720]   But the jump on this quarter, I think, was connected to--
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.560]   Huge.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.200]   --was the Verizon-- suddenly everybody
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.120]   kind of flushing into this.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.040]   I've had sales 4.69 million.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.040]   That's actually low, believe it or not, because they can't make
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.560]   enough.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.400]   They just can't make enough.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.720]   That's what they said.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.400]   And of course, much of the quarter didn't have iPad 2.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   Say again?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.800]   Also, certainly anticipation of the iPad 2 coming out.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.160]   Right.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.360]   Nobody would expect a softer.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.120]   Everybody knew the iPad 2 was coming out.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.560]   So yes, exactly.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.720]   iPad sell through 5.1 million units.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.480]   So they actually had a sell through that
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.360]   was over the shipped units.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.600]   I guess they had shipped units left over from Q0 or whatever
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.960]   comes before Q1, Q4.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.480]   Max sales up 28%.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.000]   Asia Pacific max sales up 76%.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.520]   Now, I have to say that with the addition of Thunderbolt,
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.560]   I have to say that this year I'm more excited about max
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.440]   than I have been probably in five years.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.200]   Because I think that it really is going to change a lot of things.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.040]   I think that that's a big transformation.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.720]   I think they're going to see huge sales all year.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.120]   Because a lot of people like me are
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.560]   new computers just to have that connectivity.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.120]   Right.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.840]   I pod sales, the only--
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.280]   I don't know if you call it bleak.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.360]   It just means more people bought iPhones and iPods.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.040]   17% drop in iPods sales in 9 million units.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.920]   But more than half of the iPods they're selling,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.240]   more than half are iPod touches.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.760]   That's not a surprise.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.080]   I wish I could see a breakout on what models are still
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.760]   selling that aren't iOS devices.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.540]   I think there's some really interesting
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.020]   bets to be made on what modifications Apple might
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.420]   make to the entire iPod line in the fall.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.460]   I mean, the iPod classic almost has to be gone.
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.540]   But if the-- is Apple going to still do two non-IOS iPods?
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.300]   Or are they going to simply say, let's just
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.460]   get the fitness people who just want a cheap iPod that
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.620]   double dock and sing really wild iTunes.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.700]   They don't care about a screen.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.580]   They don't care about features.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.180]   Because they probably already have either a touch or an iPhone
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.100]   for the really cool apps.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.440]   I think that the classic, actually, still fulfills
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.040]   until they have something else that has 160 gigs of storage.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.680]   I have my entire music collection on it.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.840]   So when we go on road trips, I've
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.040]   got one device that has everything that I ever want on it.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.280]   You know, it might eclipse that is this idea of cloud
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.560]   storing your stuff.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.480]   For road trips, it won't affect me.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.240]   Because you don't have internet access.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.920]   Because I have spotty internet access.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.480]   But thinking about the cloud too, that I think a lot of people
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.800]   maybe don't think about is that technology is still a little
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.440]   bit of ways out.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.960]   I mean, when you use 3G to access your data, I mean, first
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.920]   of all, it's slow.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.440]   So you're always going to be waiting.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.640]   I mean, anytime I try to use audio and I don't have music
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.640]   sunk to my phone, I'm waiting forever for these songs to
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.600]   download.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.000]   And then second--
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.560]   second--
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.440]   and my second point is that it drains your battery.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.080]   You know, whenever you use 3G, your battery goes down so fast.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.520]   It's so nice to have things stored locally on an iPod classic.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.640]   And I would add a third point, which is that all of the
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.400]   companies now are introducing bandwidth caps.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.440]   So you're going to want to be a little careful, a little
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.160]   judicious.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.920]   It's funny, I ran into--
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.440]   on the new iPad 2, I got to have a rise in package.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.640]   And I thought, oh, I'll never use more of the 3Gigs in a
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:34.880]   month.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.160]   I actually did.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.400]   In fact, I don't have 3G right now because I don't want to
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:39.920]   spend--
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.240]   they say, oh, you've run out, but you could buy more.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.560]   And I thought no.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.000]   It's a really interesting dichotomy that you brought up.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   It's like, as all these companies are moving to the
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.400]   cloud, you have the telecoms and the cable companies.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.600]   They're trying to limit how much you can access your data.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.680]   So one company's moving one way, and these other companies
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.440]   are moving the exact opposite direction.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.240]   I don't think it's a coincidence.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.000]   I think, Arfan, that these companies know that this is
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.520]   what's happening.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.920]   They're looking at Netflix.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.720]   They're looking at iTunes.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.360]   And they're saying, whoa, well, we're not on our watch,
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.840]   baby.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.880]   If you do it, we're going to charge you for it.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.720]   We're not going to just let everybody march in here and
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   have unlimited bandwidth.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.560]   So I think that it's, in fact, it's not a coincidence.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.080]   It's exactly why it's happening right now.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.240]   You still would have to, for most of the caps that are
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.960]   related, you really would have to watch a lot of movies.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.760]   No, not movies.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.280]   Movies?
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.080]   OK, so no.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.760]   I did the math on the wireless caps.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.640]   Oh, no, no, wireless.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.800]   I'm talking about wireless.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.920]   Yeah, that's a difficulty with a lot of these different
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.880]   pricing plans, too.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.360]   I mean, T-Mobile on their Android tablets, I think, kind of
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.760]   a screwed things up, where you can either get 250
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.480]   meggs per month, or you can get 4 gigs per month, which
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.720]   can spend 25 bucks a month more than you can for the iPad 3G
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.440]   package.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.320]   And that's nice.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   And the sites have 4G, but I wish there was something in
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.120]   the middle.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.120]   There's just nothing practical between those two.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.840]   And 4 gigs is still not quite enough that you can
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.800]   simply decide, you know what?
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.040]   I am going to watch several episodes of The Daily Show,
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.000]   where I am going to watch The Conan O'Brien Show every
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.800]   time I miss an episode, because you'll definitely--
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.760]   that's why you're into the Starbucks.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:21.160]   And even Landlines, Comcast has a 250 gig limit.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.120]   That'd be hard to go through that.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.480]   But AT&T's is 150 gig.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.520]   I mean, they're starting--
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.520]   they start high, and then they say, well, we're
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.120]   protecting you from bandwidth hogs.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.040]   You know, those guys are really eat up all over the bed with--
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   I got to say, though, AT&T's.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.320]   I mean, if you guys are anyone watching, you're using
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.520]   U-verse, I really--
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.960]   I mean, I just might--
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.240]   I can say this because my parents-in-law are not
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.280]   watching the show.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.440]   They have U-verse, and it is the worst video
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.120]   quality I've ever seen in a cable network ever.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.640]   I mean, I constantly look at it.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.240]   I just don't--
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.320]   because I don't want to do what I did to Scott Borne, which
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.120]   is--
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.800]   so do the macro blocks bother you?
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.280]   You know, he was--
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.520]   so I don't want to do this thing, right?
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.040]   Don't say that.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.080]   I don't say anything.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.600]   I just watch.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.160]   I just see that rainbow on your DLP projector,
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.600]   because then for the rest of their life, it's all they see.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.360]   So I don't say anything, but I'm just like,
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.560]   holy smokes is this bad.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.680]   And it's just-- it's not sharp at all.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.400]   And the scary thing now is that a lot of times
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.960]   I'm finding that my experience with Netflix
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.360]   is better than Comcast.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.840]   It looks pretty good.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.160]   It has 720p if you have that.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.080]   It's caching.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.080]   When you get an HD, if you have enough bandwidth,
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.480]   it's pretty good.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.440]   I mean, 720p, but I watch it on 60-inch screens all the time.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:29.960]   I love it.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.960]   Of course, I have a 60-inch screen in every room of my house.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.960]   Every room in the bathroom?
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   In the bathroom?
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   It's joking.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.120]   Yes, all for example TV is the reason
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.680]   I don't have cable in my--
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.000]   in the living room of my house.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.480]   Right.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.880]   You guys, good enough?
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.680]   Hey, I'm not done.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.240]   There's still more good news from Apple in the earnings call.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.440]   It's kind of hard to believe that there's more iTunes
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:57.080]   store sales of $1.4 billion in a quarter.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.240]   They don't give a year to year on that.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.320]   Gross margin.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.000]   This is the-- how much their profit margin is.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.960]   Last-- the stock market thought it'd be--
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.120]   analysts, that'd be 38%, 41.4% margin.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.640]   Wow.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.160]   That's pretty darn good.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.200]   I mean, I don't know what's typical in the technology
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.400]   industry, but--
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:16.920]   That's good.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.720]   I know when-- if we came anywhere close to that,
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.240]   I'd be jumping up and down.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.560]   I think that the thing is is that what Apple has done
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.880]   is they've really-- they own the crowd that's
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.640]   willing to pay that margin.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.200]   And they're making everybody else compete for the crowd that
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.160]   will not pay for that margin.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.840]   You still hear Apple's are more expensive.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.080]   You still hear that when I recommend an Apple on the radio
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.520]   show, oh, it's overpriced, you sometimes even here.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.980]   But then people-- I think they start
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.840]   to realize that, well, what are reasons that that PCU bought
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.960]   is so cheap as there's no service or support?
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.080]   They've unbundled that.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.800]   So do you want service and support?
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.880]   Well, that's going to cost you.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.560]   Sometimes they use cheaper components.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.240]   And also, I have to say that the game changer as you
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.380]   start to use stuff like the Mac App Store, which I'll just
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.000]   come back to, is that because you can install it,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.800]   I have a bunch of computers that are all registered.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   And I can install--
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.760]   Is it five?
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.440]   I don't know.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.400]   I have five, and it's all installing.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.280]   So I don't know.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.120]   I haven't done more than that.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.900]   I'll test it.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.060]   But the point is is that--
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.900]   The reason I ask is when Final Cut comes out,
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.260]   I'll install it everywhere.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.100]   Well, and the thing is is that when
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.940]   you start doing that math of the way
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.180]   that that licensing works, then Macs get real cheap
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.780]   because now it's changing all the licensing for all the software
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.420]   that you buy throughout your entire house,
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.180]   that you can be legal and licensed across all of these
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.020]   things because a lot of these companies have gotten really
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.060]   good at protecting their software by making sure
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.380]   that they don't run on the same network
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.240]   and they don't, and they have to be registered and everything
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.560]   else, and Apple's getting rid of all of that.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.400]   And so that starts to really add up
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.000]   if you start buying any level of tools.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.480]   That's a big issue because I have a couple iPads
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.400]   and a couple iPhones, and all of that stuff is just,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.320]   I just sync it up, and it's not a big deal.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.600]   $66 billion in the piggy bank.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.280]   Wow.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   $66 billion--
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.280]   But the hell will work, Joey.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.080]   That's their cash.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.440]   Yeah, they can bail out the banks at this point.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.120]   If they wanted to--
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:06.640]   A lot with that.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.440]   That's a ton of money.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.720]   They could buy the record.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.520]   That's a scary amount of cash we're sitting on because not only
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.700]   is it the ability to get into whatever business they want
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.740]   to get into, it's also the ability
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.180]   to buy a company that it thinks is going to produce a technology
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.260]   that other companies can really, really ride into town on
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.900]   and simply say, we hired this company.
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.700]   We really just wanted its talent and its video compression
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.300]   codec.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.460]   That wonderful product that was going to sync the iPhone
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:31.980]   in two years--
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.340]   Maybe we're not going to act like--
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.500]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.420]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.700]   Lala.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.520]   I'm not done.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.580]   Apple stores, 71 million visitors.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.280]   That's up 50%.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.060]   50% over last year.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.920]   With Apple says, we don't need to go to trade shows.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.680]   We've got the stores.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.160]   There's a trade show in every town going on all the time.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.800]   I believe it's the highest income per square foot of any store
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.040]   chain in the world.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.080]   I was so skeptical when they announced these.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.060]   And boy, have they proven me wrong.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.640]   Store sales up 90%.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.280]   Store sales up 90% year to year.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.700]   That's $3.19 billion.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.400]   Their cash, as you said, is up.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.600]   It's $65.8 billion.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.200]   That's up.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.440]   They do have to say about the stores.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.440]   $6.1 billion more than last year.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.280]   Not going down.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.720]   Well, and the thing is they do everything right at the stores.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.120]   I feel like you get the attention that you want,
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.080]   but not so much attention that you feel grounded.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.560]   Everything's easy to find.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.640]   It is-- people can-- there's almost never a line,
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.240]   because everyone's walking around with an iPhone.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.560]   That can scan your credit card.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.320]   People are knowledgeable when you're talking to them.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.280]   I mean, it's just a really easy retail experience.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.920]   And they definitely created them so that each store would
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.880]   be an embassy, not a retail experience.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.120]   And I think that I'm with you, Leo.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.120]   Remember that when Apple started the store,
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.920]   it wasn't that they started it because all these other companies
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.000]   had-- that gateway started their own stores.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.960]   And I went great, and Dell started their own stores.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   And they went great.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.320]   All these companies decided to start their own stores.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.720]   And they went belly up within four or five months.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.680]   So it was such a radical thing for them to do.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.120]   But Apple's idea was number one, they
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   made really great management decisions from the start,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.440]   where the Apple stores were all company owned
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.120]   and always done at the corporate level.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.000]   Some of these other companies decided to simply say,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.240]   well, we'll hire this guy with retailing experience.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.720]   We will have him started to change the stores
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.520]   that we will then lend our name to.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.360]   So this is yet another example of how, when Apple decides
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.200]   to be a control freak about something,
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.000]   it's not because they want to be jerks.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.600]   It's because they have an idea and a plan.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.280]   They know how to make something work.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.760]   And they want to be able to say a few years later that, oh,
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.960]   by the way, our revenue is still up 50%.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.800]   We're still producing x dollars per square foot.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.040]   I mean, if there's places in certain city areas where
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.120]   you can buy a crystalline substance that is not
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.480]   as profitable per square foot space, probably
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.640]   because they don't sell anything that's
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.360]   quite as addictive as an iPad.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.560]   So instead of setting up these corner drugstores on the wire,
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.640]   they should have set up Apple stores.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.120]   Well, when we talk about moving into--
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.200]   this was in the New York Times.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.840]   When we talk about moving into an industry,
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.240]   keep in mind, Apple has $66 billion in the bank.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.200]   Netflix market capitalization is $13.2 billion.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.760]   Oh, they could buy so much stuff.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.760]   With cash.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.200]   And it wouldn't even--
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.400]   that would be like two quarters worth of cash for them.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.680]   But I don't think it's Apple's way.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.760]   I think Apple has said if you want to be in that industry,
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.360]   they just would put it in Netflix out of business
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.400]   by doing it better.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.840]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.600]   But I'm just saying that when they want to move into an industry,
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.320]   it's interesting that they haven't.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.760]   They're sitting on that cash.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.880]   It's a great point, too, because if you look at a company
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.360]   like Microsoft who has a lot of cash,
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.640]   and they're using it for all these different things,
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.040]   they're putting their hands into all these different markets.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.520]   And sometimes something sticks, and oftentimes they
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.640]   create a product that is unsuccessful,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.040]   and they have to squash it soon.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.280]   And Apple really takes on that philosophy
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.720]   to feel that if they can't do something really well,
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.560]   there's no point even going to try.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.200]   So here they have all this cash that they're just sitting on,
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.480]   and they could be using it for all these different things.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.920]   Like a lot of the companies out there do,
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.920]   but they're like, no, we're going to save this
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.400]   until we really have a good use for it.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.880]   I think it's classic Apple.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.280]   Wi-Fi grids.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.560]   That's what I think they should do.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.480]   It would cost them $15 to $20 billion.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.720]   I think that's-- if you're listening out--
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   Wi-Fi grids.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.440]   We're thinking our show notes to Jean-Louis Gesset's
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.560]   great blog, the Monday note, because Jean-Louis, former Apple
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.040]   president--
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.840]   And B.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.120]   --and credit BOS, and knows a lot about stuff,
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.760]   did some deeper analysis looking at the 10Q and stuff,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.120]   and found some very interesting numbers that weren't highlighted
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   by all the other press.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   For instance, the combined iOS platform--
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.720]   iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches--
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.080]   has 37.9 million devices.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.560]   That's 59% more than Android.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:13.080]   So iOS is super strong right now, 37.9 million.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.160]   In Europe, in the five European markets,
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.880]   it's even stronger, 116% stronger than Android,
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.960]   with 28.9 million users.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:28.720]   In Asia, the iPhone is up 250% in sales year to year.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   Have you seen especially what the iPhone's doing in China?
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.160]   China's huge.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.680]   It's becoming the phone to have.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.280]   It's the phone.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.160]   Even though there are lots of clones in China.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.560]   And according to Jean-Louis Gesset,
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.000]   the Shanghai Apple Store is doing more volume
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   than the New York Fifth Avenue Store.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.080]   And there's a new store in the works in China,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.160]   the largest in China.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.360]   But here's another number that I thought--
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.120]   he does some really interesting analysis.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:05.480]   Apple is the number five vendor of PCs in the US.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   Market share last year, 7.3%.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.920]   This year, 9.3%.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.560]   It's an 18% growth.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.160]   Acer down 24%.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.720]   Down, Dell down, 12%.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.400]   HP down, 3%.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.600]   In fact, everybody's down, except Toshiba and Apple.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.000]   And Apple's up a whopping 18% year to year.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.720]   This could be the beginning of an Apple takeover
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.760]   in terms of PC shipments.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.480]   Let's see.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.800]   There--
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.720]   Well, I think that when you--
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.480]   Actually, that was Gartner and then IDCS,
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.400]   slightly different numbers, but still roughly the same
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.840]   in terms of growth.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.760]   And I don't know where--
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.520]   I saw a number where it talked about the distinction
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.520]   between business purchases and institutional purchases
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.520]   and personal purchases.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.440]   And when you take out business and institutional purchases,
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.160]   then Apple is in the 50%, 60% range.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.560]   They're a much higher percentage of personal people buying them
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.200]   for themselves.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:03.680]   Yes, I would agree.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.280]   Businesses are the ones that are making top-down decisions
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.480]   of the bottom line.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.840]   And these are buying Macs in huge numbers.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.040]   You go into any startup these days.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:13.880]   It's all Mac.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.200]   Even if they're running Windows.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.960]   Yeah, they're running Windows if they have to.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.760]   But really, there's Macs everywhere.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.280]   Now, here's the one interesting number
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.240]   that he pulled out that I thought was kind of surprising.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.600]   R&D--
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.960]   Microsoft's R&D is about 15% of revenue.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.920]   Apple's research and development, 2% of revenue.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.840]   Now, he points out that partly that's
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.880]   because Apple has such a high revenue.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.680]   It says 2% of what is it?
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.720]   2% of 20--
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.320]   Still a chunk of change.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   $4 billion.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   But it's also because they're not going in so many different
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.280]   directions at one time.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.680]   Well, they have fewer things to research.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.080]   They research an iPhone.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.080]   They research an iPad.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.000]   And they research some Mac.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.920]   I mean, it's very simple.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.280]   They're not making connect.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.720]   Well, and I think that this was the big argument with Gil
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.520]   Emilio and when Steve Jobs came in was that Steve Jobs was
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.320]   like, we're playing in their briar patch rather than forcing
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.440]   them to play in our briar patch.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.640]   And Apple's advantage is the vertical market.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.440]   It's the fact that they own the software and the hardware
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.760]   and they own the whole kit and kaboodle.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.280]   And they just keep on extending that advantage.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.240]   And that's the thing that is hard because no one else can do
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.680]   that.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.000]   And I think it lowers R&D costs because they don't have to--
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.920]   Well, I guess things just--
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.000]   actually, if you analyze it, that's a good number.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.520]   Well, basically, what he's saying in this--
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.720]   and I highly recommend this blog post because it's fascinating
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   is--
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.320]   and I'm looking at the numbers.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:39.760]   I've never looked.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.480]   I didn't used to know what balance sheet looked like,
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.960]   but now I've learned.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.120]   And looking at the numbers, what strikes one
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.760]   is what a tight ship Apple runs.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.680]   This is an amazingly--
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.800]   from what I look at, amazingly well-run company.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.440]   Well, you feel that when you're down there.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.600]   I mean, when you're at one infinite loop,
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.640]   I mean, it feels like a very tight ship.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.040]   I mean, you have people that are pretty focused.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.800]   And you know that that's not just Steve Jobs.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.960]   But it's kind of true that he created it.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.600]   It's a culture he created, but that kind of speaks to the notion
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.320]   of what it'll be like without Steve.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.160]   Steve isn't figuring out how much money
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.680]   is going to be spent on janitorial services.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.680]   And yet, it's very, very tight, very well-run,
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.280]   which means he's got very good people Tim Cookin' on down.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.120]   And I think it's one of the reasons Wall Street is
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.880]   rewarding Apple, even though Steve isn't in day to day
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.240]   anymore, rewarding Apple.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.680]   Well, it's hard-- he's not there day to day,
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.400]   and they have quarters like that.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.520]   It's going to be hard to ignore.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.000]   Well, you could say there's still
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.040]   got a lot of momentum.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.280]   There's Steve momentum.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.960]   Everything they're selling right now is made by Steve, right?
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.520]   Right.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.960]   I think it says that on the box.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.040]   Design in California made by Steve.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.440]   Maybe they should just name everybody at Foxconn Steve,
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.760]   and that would really--
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.280]   Steveconn.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:53.640]   Steveconn.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.840]   Get them all those black turtlanks.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.960]   So good interesting numbers all around for Apple.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.800]   Very bullish.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.480]   I don't follow the stock market particularly,
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.280]   but I am sure that the stock market reacted well,
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.480]   especially when you exceed analysts' expectations,
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.160]   which Apple always does because they're so good at sandbagging
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.440]   that damn analysts.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.200]   We're having trouble.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   We can't make enough.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.760]   It's all not working.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.360]   Oh, wait.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:16.880]   It actually--
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.560]   Oh, it did work.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.640]   It actually turned out.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.480]   Wow.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.040]   Apple's very glad, Oss, when it comes to the analysts.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.720]   This is a triumph by making a note here.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.360]   Huge success.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.120]   Huge success.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.200]   But you got to bet you--
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.800]   but I think that a lot of people are probably
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.720]   a little bit worried because this is--
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.600]   you could do a simple search from replace
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.680]   and turn this into a story about the housing market
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.720]   about seven or eight years ago.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.640]   Another great quarter.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.440]   Now, this property is our value up.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.720]   Another 40% or 50%.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.320]   There's no top to this.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.360]   This is the rocket ride.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.560]   And I'm kind of wondering how long it is before--
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.480]   remember that we've seen over the past couple of years
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.840]   that Apple has come up with and absolutely knocked
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.800]   the industry on its butt product pretty much once a year
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.520]   for the past two or three years.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.000]   And once that they have pretty much all their chess
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.200]   pieces on the board, how many years
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.880]   are going to go by where they just
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.480]   come out with better versions of iPads,
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.880]   better versions of iPhones.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.280]   But they don't have the hoverboard yet.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.200]   And how soon before the curve starts to flatten off,
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.680]   and they only have $90 billion in cash.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.000]   And they're only insanely profitable before people
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.760]   start saying, well, let's start selling our Apple stock
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.960]   because we're expecting an 80% return on our investment.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.720]   True.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.080]   But that's stock price.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.440]   And I have to say, when I see--
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.680]   Those are too good.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.920]   Yeah, those people-- they're doing something
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.440]   that is not necessarily the equivalent of saying how well
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.760]   a company is going to do, which you'd
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.200]   think they were, but apparently it has nothing to do with it.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.040]   He compares-- Gasey compares, for instance,
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.280]   their operating expenses-- sales
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.720]   generally administrative to HPs.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.440]   And I mean, they're like twice as good as HP.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.280]   Their operating expenses are 7%, which he says,
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.000]   I don't know of a tighter and, at the same time,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.120]   more prosperous ship.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.880]   And by the way, Gasey, despite being formerly having rainbow
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.640]   blood, is, in fact, I think, pretty strong critic
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.560]   and sometimes of Apple.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.160]   He's not an Apple cheerleader by any means.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.000]   Oh, he left.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.160]   He said, yeah.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:20.440]   He says Apple is the most profitable PC maker and smartphone
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:25.000]   and MP3 and tablet maker in the world.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   He says, HP, the largest PC maker,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.400]   gets 6% operating income out of its $10 billion product
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.080]   revenue.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.840]   Apple gets 31%.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.120]   Wow.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.040]   That's a big difference.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.240]   They're doing OK.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.840]   I got something figured out over there.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.840]   He goes out to lunch with an Apple person.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.240]   Don't reach for the check too fast.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.640]   Now, he does talk about some worrisome stuff.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.080]   The cloud, he says, is worrisome.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.440]   He says, I work is getting very long in the tooth, which
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:54.960]   is true.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.360]   In fact, I'm wondering if they've abandoned I work.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   He says, I web hasn't been updated in how long?
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.120]   I think I was in love for the world, but pages and numbers
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.240]   are both huge successes.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.880]   If you look at the percentage of people
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.720]   who have switched away from office to these two products,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.800]   if a user in general, if a user has the free choice
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.000]   to use whatever spreadsheet, whatever word process
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.080]   that they have, they are choosing these two apps,
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.360]   these two $15 apps that are so well supported by the company
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.320]   and not Microsoft Office, which Microsoft has not really
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.600]   found a way to really truly reinvent this suite for the 2010s.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.720]   It's still the go-to solution if you're
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.240]   doing really complicated collaborative work.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.840]   But for people who want to have $15 in their pocket
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.560]   and they want a good word processor that can do anything
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.400]   from a two page letter to a 100 page book,
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.320]   that's where they're going.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.000]   You know that, again, $15 for a copy of pages
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.840]   that works on all the machines that you're logged into.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.840]   Yeah, that's the-- you know, it doesn't--
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.560]   those are very, very--
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.600]   We've switched the whole company.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.720]   To be honest, a word processor, one of the things
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.000]   I kind of laugh at Microsoft because they have to update
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.600]   Word every two years for their revenue.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.560]   Word processor, there's not a lot of new stuff
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.160]   you can do in a Word processor.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.120]   Five one.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.720]   Yeah, that was the last good word on Mac.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.600]   We talked about this before.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.520]   I wish WordPerfect 3 would come back now.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.880]   3.5, now that was a good Word process.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   Exactly.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.800]   I think that Apple's probably going to do a bundle like IDVD,
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.520]   IWEDS Suite for people who do lots of stuff in 1998.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.360]   Yes, our dead product.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:30.720]   I'm not going to--
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.720]   1993.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.880]   Apple's dead product.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.760]   Dead's on Clarisworks.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.600]   Throw that in there too.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.440]   That'd be great.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.680]   No, no, Clarisworks was not good.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.520]   MIT flea market.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.840]   I had an opportunity to buy a brand new shrink wrap
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.760]   in the box copy of Mac Paint.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.600]   Ooh!
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.920]   Ooh, I want that.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.160]   The Claris logo, the one that actually had layers in it.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.240]   I don't even remember that.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.160]   I would love-- you know, we're accumulating
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.360]   a lot of old computer and even older technology
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.040]   for the new studio.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.800]   I think I have an old classic somewhere.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.480]   Please.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   I would love it.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.320]   In fact, somebody just sent me a Clio, which I couldn't believe.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.520]   I'll show you that.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.520]   But anything that you have that's cluttering up your garage--
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:06.960]   No, wait.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.280]   Such a dangerous thing to say.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.520]   Yeah, I would.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.440]   I can probably get you a black bell and how
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.680]   a Apple II, if you'd like one.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.600]   Really?
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.360]   I think I have two of them.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:15.960]   Wow.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.240]   I've always been in my two flea market for about 15,
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.240]   20 years now.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.200]   There is very little with an Apple logo on it that I do.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.720]   I might regret this.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.240]   What we were going to do is put them in the window
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.520]   to distract looters.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.480]   Oh, an Apple II.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.720]   You know, they don't know anything.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.600]   They'll just grab the Apple II and they won't go straight
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.200]   for the--
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.160]   Oh, I think it's high voltage Tesla coins.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.960]   It's going to be more like, hey, look, a computer.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.320]   Oh, it's an Apple.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.480]   It's a Mac SE.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.760]   There's nothing good in there.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.600]   I bet they've got--
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.080]   Right.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.320]   They've got a funny inch color Sears TVs.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.320]   I need to break it there.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.680]   Couple of one other footnote.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.720]   1.8 million Apple TVs, the new Apple TVs, sold.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.320]   Pretty good for a hobby.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.280]   You compare it to the Google TV.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.080]   So it makes you wonder if their next big product is a TV.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.280]   Like now that this hobby is becoming a business.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.360]   I mean, now that the hobby is starting
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.800]   to turn into something real.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.520]   You know, this is up the point I was
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.560]   going to make a little bit earlier.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.680]   I think one of the reasons why they're so profitable
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.040]   and they are so lean is that they are not--
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.840]   I don't believe-- I could be wrong--
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   but I don't believe that the company that would say,
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.160]   let's start spreading out into TVs
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.320]   a business that we don't know a whole lot about.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.560]   And there really is no benefit for us to branch into it.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.680]   But we can say that we're selling a TV set.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.560]   They're the company that would correctly say,
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.440]   we don't care where you buy your TV from.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.680]   We want to sell you the box.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.080]   It has the cool electronics in it that
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.960]   makes everything else that we sell with an Apple logo on it
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.280]   that much more valuable.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.160]   And which helps you increase-- turn the tap of money
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.840]   from your pocket into the iTunes store
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.560]   to turn it all the way to full blast.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.080]   No.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.000]   I guess for me though, I think that the last step though
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.280]   is the camera inside.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   I mean, I just want a 46-inch iMac.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.000]   I mean, the thing is is that it's-- or just iOS.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.600]   I don't need it to have anything else.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.320]   But I feel like-- number one is I feel like the Apple TV,
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:01.560]   too.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.120]   I'm waiting for them to open up the iOS
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.920]   so that we can actually use applications there.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.160]   That's the ultimate little net box if they did that.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.560]   Well, and John Louise points that out.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.040]   He's saying, well, see what happens there.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.280]   That's a $99 net box.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:11.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.120]   Yeah, that's very interesting.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.080]   You know, with iOS.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.200]   But I agree with Andy.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.160]   I think that one of the reasons Apple's done so well,
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160]   they've stuck to their knitting.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.240]   I looked at McDonald's.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.920]   In the old days, they would make a ferry.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.320]   Everybody else was making-- Dairy Queen
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.560]   had 300 of menu items.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.360]   But Donald said we do this, this, and this.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.720]   In fact, it really didn't all start
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.600]   to go to hell in a handbasket till the McRib.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.560]   Isn't there actually a principle of neuroscience
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.480]   that says that increasing the number of options
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.120]   leads to poor decisions and longer decisions
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:41.880]   rather than that?
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.760]   Yeah, but Apple didn't--
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.640]   That there's actually--
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.200]   No, that there's actually the hard top limit
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.280]   that if you give someone three options,
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.400]   they can make a good decision.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.400]   If you give them five options, they'll take them four times
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.040]   as long and they'll make a bad one.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.400]   I think this is one of the reasons.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.800]   I think they're very aware of that.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.760]   There's actually a hard number, maybe, even somewhere
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.920]   in Apple that says we cannot make more than X versions
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.160]   of this product.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.400]   Too many skews.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.200]   I just think that, to me, a TV is just such--
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.800]   it's like the last extension of the tiny iPhone, to the iPad,
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.680]   to a--
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.040]   Yeah, but it's such a trophy that you don't want to have.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.480]   I think that if Apple were to Sony and other companies
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.640]   would be old-fashioned enough to say that, well, we're
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.720]   not the consumer electronics business unless we sell a TV set
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.520]   and a console stereo.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.040]   We can't-- our mommy won't love us
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.320]   and think we're successes unless we're selling a console
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.360]   stereo with a record player.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.960]   And room for records, not realizing that, well, actually,
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.680]   that's been years to same.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.560]   I'm kind of with Andy on that, but on the other hand,
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.240]   I'm not going to predict because I've never
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.760]   been able to predict what that was going to do.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.360]   We're taking our old iMacs, the 21 or 24-inch iMacs
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.840]   that we've been doing production for Mac Break-On,
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.800]   because we've got-- Those are TVs.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.400]   I know I understand.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.560]   And so we're putting them on the walls in Twit.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.120]   In the new studio, we're putting them on the wall
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.680]   to manage schedules.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.760]   And the thing is, is that what I really want is an iOS
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.080]   version of that, because I don't really need all of us to that.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.400]   I guess here's the real point.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.760]   The last-- I bought a new TV.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.960]   I'm suddenly replacing all the big CRT TVs in my house
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.920]   with LCDs, maybe, of course, of one a year.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.000]   I think I replaced the last one this year.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.840]   And the first one cost me about $600.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.000]   The second one, a year and a half ago,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.800]   cost me something like $400.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.080]   Last year, a TV that's just as good as the first one I bought
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.320]   cost me $213.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.200]   And that's what Apple's seriously going
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.120]   to have to compete against, because people
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.800]   are not going to-- the people who buy TVs are not looking for,
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.840]   oh, what's my XML R&R PC?
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.720]   Yeah, but that's what they said about phones.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.280]   That's what they say about computers.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.040]   That's what Apple does, is they create something--
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.040]   I said the same thing I said, don't get in the phone business.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.360]   Here's a phone.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.120]   That's a TV.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.120]   They're real different.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.320]   I don't think it's a scalable--
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.800]   It's a scalable--
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.640]   You've made your point.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.520]   We have to take a break.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.320]   I want to--
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:58.440]   God's sakes.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.640]   People buy these things to watch.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.400]   Morrie Povet, oh my god, who's my baby dad?
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.000]   He goes, this is not in the same market
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.120]   as the people who are buying these things.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.600]   And that will be the final word.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.400]   We will move on.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.200]   We have to take a break.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.000]   I'm remaining silent.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   There's so much to talk about.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.960]   I don't want to get too bogged down,
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.440]   because we still got to talk about the privacy thing.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.640]   And why is Apple telling employees
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.680]   not to take a vacation on three days in May?
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   That's coming up in just a bit.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.960]   But first, let's talk about my friends
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.080]   at Citrix, the great makers of Go to Meeting, Go to my PC,
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.440]   Go to Assist, of course, the great Citrix Enterprise
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.080]   Remote Access.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.800]   These are the kings of Remote Access.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.960]   And Go to Meeting is the king of online meeting services.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.160]   I know you have other choices.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.200]   And I encourage you to try them all.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.320]   But--
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.160]   This is the one that works.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.320]   --the one you want.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.360]   I don't know what else to say.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   This is the one you want.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.120]   But here's the deal.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:48.720]   Try them all.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.120]   You've got a 30-day free trial with Go to Meeting.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.600]   Have your next meeting with Go to Meeting
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.600]   and see how people react.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.040]   You could start the meeting so easily.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.640]   You could do it in email invitation.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.640]   That, by the way, includes a real phone number,
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:59.400]   because that's built in.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.920]   They've got a voice bridge built in,
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.240]   as well as the ability to click a link and use your built-in
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.080]   computer speakers and microphone
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.000]   and have the meeting over VoIP.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.440]   It even works on the iPad.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.880]   The Go to Meeting app on the iPad is free.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.400]   And as long as you're within--
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.800]   I haven't tried it on 3G, but I would think it would work with 3G
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.320]   as well.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.320]   You can just wander anywhere and have a meeting.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.040]   It's just amazing.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.920]   Mac PC, cross-platform, easy to use.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.120]   And that's important too, because if it's a sales presentation,
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.760]   you don't want to say, oh, hey, client,
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.880]   I've got to make you do all this work to do the presentation.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.600]   Very simple.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.920]   They click a link.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.280]   The Go to Meeting software downloads.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.440]   It takes about 30 seconds.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.800]   And now they're seeing your computer screen on their computer
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.080]   screen.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.880]   They see your keynote presentation.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.680]   They see your websites.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.040]   You can collaborate on documents.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:44.920]   You can share screens.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.920]   They can share screens back.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.120]   Well, we have people who have asked us
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.640]   because we use Go to Meeting a lot.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:53.120]   And they ask, oh, you can use these clients,
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.240]   and you can do this stuff.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.080]   And I was like, have you done that with someone who
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.120]   doesn't know how to do that?
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.080]   That's the real issue.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.080]   You can just settle in.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   You can just settle in.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.760]   You know, to do that.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.640]   It is fantastic.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:02.920]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.360]   Go to Meeting.com.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.520]   Click the Try It Free button.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.400]   Use the offer code Macbreak.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.840]   Geo, T-O, Meeting.com.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.680]   Offer code Macbreak, 30 days free.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.520]   So there's no excuse.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.880]   As many meetings as you want, by the way, as long as you want.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.080]   You just pay a flat monthly rate.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.320]   I think it's $49.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.560]   That includes the Voice Bridge.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.720]   That includes VoIP.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.240]   That includes all the software.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:25.920]   It's amazing.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.000]   Free for the first 30 days.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.560]   Go to Meeting.com.

[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.840]   Please do use Macbreak so that we get credit for it.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:40.720]   I don't want them to think that some other show drove you to it.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.400]   No, because you know what their show on this network actually
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.600]   advertises with Go to Meeting.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.720]   So you want to make sure that--
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.920]   Say they all do.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.200]   But I'm not going to say anything.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.360]   Macbreak, Macbreak, Macbreak.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.400]   Real quick, and then we'll get to the big--
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.760]   I think even a bigger story this week, of course,
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.480]   privacy issue.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.560]   But for some reason, this just came out in Apple Insider.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.840]   Apple retail employees have been told they may not
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:11.400]   request vacation days May 20, 21, or 22.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.360]   Now, it could be a coenke thing, but that happens
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.200]   to be the 10th anniversary of the first Apple store.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.000]   Party.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.520]   Party.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.400]   Party at the Apple store.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.720]   Or--
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.880]   I'm going to go to the Ginza.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.680]   I'm going to go to the Ginza Apple store.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.320]   I'll be in Paris.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.320]   I'll go to the Paris Apple store.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.040]   I'll be in Tokyo.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.880]   Let's report in.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.600]   OK.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.440]   I'll report from Paris.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.680]   You report from the Ginza.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.200]   Ginza.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.160]   That's not the same as Ginzou, is it?
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:33.920]   Those are the knives.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.400]   It is the Ginza Apple store in--
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.920]   which we got the story from.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.760]   You know, the one about Apple taking care of people
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.480]   during the earthquake.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.600]   But the Ginza store is one of the coolest Apple stores.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.880]   If you're ever in Tokyo, it's like five stories high.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.600]   There's this cool elevator that takes you to each one.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.840]   There's a theater on one whole floor.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.120]   It is-- it's really cool.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.520]   Now, they did this before this year.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.000]   iPad 2 and Verizon iPhone.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.440]   I am going to go out on a limb.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.480]   We're starting to-- maybe Zach--
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.600]   Zach Efren.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.640]   Maybe-- I did it.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.320]   I finally did it.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.520]   I knew I would do it.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.640]   So I've gotten it out of the way, Erfan Elijah.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.440]   Maybe you know something.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.880]   We're starting to see a lot of rumors
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.840]   flowing around about a new iPhone.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.800]   Maybe we were wrong.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.160]   Maybe there will be one.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.000]   I think there will be.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.800]   But I don't think it's going to be an iPhone 5.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.320]   I think it's going to be an iPhone 4S.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   4S in what will it have?
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:31.800]   Excuse me.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.200]   I think that basically what they're going to do
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.280]   is just put a lot of the hardware that they have in the iPad
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.600]   2 in the iPhone 4S.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.880]   And it makes sense for them to do that,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.560]   because Apple likes to standardize the hardware
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.360]   they use across a lot of these mobile devices,
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.880]   because it increases their profit margins.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.720]   They're going to be buying these things for a better price.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.280]   And historically, it's kind of what they do, right?
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.520]   They release an OS, and they update it,
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.880]   and then they release a new OS.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.680]   They release an iDevice, they update it,
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.000]   and then they release a new iDevice.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.200]   They do this with their computers, too.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.560]   So when we do see a new iPhone, iPhone 4S,
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.000]   and I think the iPhone 5 is probably going to come next year
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.160]   with the new form factor that everyone keeps talking about.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.680]   And you think the iPhone 4S will be maybe in May or June,
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.240]   or do you think it'll be as some have said in the fall?
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.640]   I think it's going to be in the fall,
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.680]   especially now they just released the white iPhone.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.480]   It makes zero sense for them to release a white iPhone.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.960]   I think it makes zero sense for them to release the white iPhone.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.720]   You can stop, full stop, period.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.640]   What the hell?
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.360]   Is there this huge pen up demand?
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.080]   I've been waiting for one for a year and a half.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.800]   Apparently there is, really?
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.840]   It was pen up demand with him.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.560]   Look at this old 3GS I have here.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.680]   And you didn't buy an iPhone 4 because--
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.880]   I'm waiting specifically for the white iPhone.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.920]   You can make fun of me, all my friends do, too.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.760]   There's like a 4-ner.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.920]   I wanted that white iPhone.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.440]   So it's your fault?
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.160]   Well, I don't know.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.520]   I did send an email for Steve asking for one.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   Maybe he did it on my account.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.240]   Did he say, yep?
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:57.880]   That's all he said.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.920]   Yeah, yes, he's coming.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.240]   Yep.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.040]   He talks like a cowboy.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.720]   He talks like Clint Eastwood in one of those spaghetti
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.320]   Westings.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.080]   Yep.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.800]   Steve, will there be a white iPhone?
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   Yep.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.120]   Sure, no.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.480]   Well, apparently now it's today, right?
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.480]   Or is it supposed to be in the store?
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.560]   Has anybody got a white iPhone yet?
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.400]   Does anybody care?
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.200]   OK.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:19.840]   It's going to show dirt.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.640]   That's all I got to say.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.240]   It's going to show dirt.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.440]   I had a white iPhone.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.360]   I had a white 3G or 3GS.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.640]   I did.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.680]   It was only a white on the back.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.800]   This is white on the back and the front.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.120]   See, I don't want--
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.680]   So my wife has a white iPad.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.160]   And I don't really like it that much because I think
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.120]   it's harder when you're watching movies on it.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.400]   It also looks like it's smaller.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.760]   The frame of the bezel looks bigger because it's white.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.480]   But anyway, we're not going to worry about your--
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.640]   that's just your problem.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:55.920]   So you think that because of the big release of the white iPhone
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.720]   that they're going to hold--
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.520]   they're going to let that pent up demand abate before they do--
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.960]   Yeah, it just doesn't make sense to me
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.160]   to release something that people have been waiting for.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.400]   And then two months later--
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.560]   or a month later, it'd be like, oh, by the way,
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.440]   that thing you just bought--
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.200]   forget about that.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.280]   Here's a new thing.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.120]   And you think we'll see a T-Mobile--
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.760]   do you think we'll see the T-Mobile one that they've been
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.080]   rumored?
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.800]   Will that be part of the iPhone 4s?
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.200]   Oh, that wouldn't surprise me.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.920]   AT&T is trying to get their hands on T-Mobile.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.920]   So it's only a matter of time before they have it.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.080]   And now they're testing it.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.440]   Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me at all.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:33.000]   We saw that very soon within the next four to six months.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.280]   So it would make sense they would put an A5 chip in there.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.800]   It makes sense that if they can get that Qualcomm dual CDMA/GSM
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.200]   chip that put that in there, then they don't
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.840]   have to make one skew.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.080]   Exactly.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:45.960]   For everything.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.480]   And now the one-- have you seen--
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.720]   we've all seen these photoshopped images
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:55.800]   with a thin bezel, or maybe it's not, in a smaller screen.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.360]   Same resolution, smaller screen.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.360]   You think that's what the iPhone 4s will be?
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.520]   That skinny iPhone?
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.200]   Are you talking about the one that's tapered?
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.640]   It looks like it's your drop?
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:04.920]   Boy, I hope so.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.960]   That thing looks great.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.320]   But it's just like all the other mock-ups I've seen
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.800]   where some really great artists put something together.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.240]   That's what it looks like to me, too.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.960]   Yeah, it looks awesome, doesn't it,
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.240]   with the little sliding home button?
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.200]   So I hope so, but I don't think that's
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.880]   what it's going to look like.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.400]   OK, well, there you have it.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.840]   We don't know.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.560]   It's definitive.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.640]   We have absolutely no idea what's going to happen.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.400]   And it's an artistic party.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.320]   Well, it could be a big party.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.320]   If it weren't for the weekend, I would say one possibility
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.840]   would be if they're just training up.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.320]   But I just think there-- I really-- I think all science point
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.080]   to some sort of event.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.560]   And I don't want to complicate the discussion.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.440]   But I did find five different religious websites that
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.320]   claim that May 21 is going to be the biblical Armageddon day.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.040]   So maybe they want the whole Apple family to be together
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.400]   so they can usher in the tongues of fire.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.720]   It might turn out that during the rapture,
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.680]   it turns out if you're an Apple user, you're going to heaven.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.960]   And they're just preparing everybody.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.960]   We know that.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.680]   You get everybody to the stores, because that's
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.360]   where the liftoff is going to occur.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.120]   The stores, it turns out, are not just stores.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.320]   They are spaceships.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.840]   I'm going to get my running shoes and--
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.920]   This is my Scientology theory here.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.560]   All the Apple stores are actually spaceships.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.560]   We've been part of this religion for a long time.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.200]   We're all going to the Apple store on the day of Armageddon.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.560]   And we're all blasting off while the earth just bolts into nothing.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.000]   Here we go.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:30.960]   You receive your black mic.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.480]   May 21.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.480]   You're a purple shroud.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.480]   And the men's on the red shirt for us.
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.800]   If you did not register a product in the past 30 days,
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.640]   you can purchase them for nominal fee at the apps store.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:45.720]   Now Arnold Kim posted yesterday on MacRumors.com.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.840]   You had another picture.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:54.760]   This one of an iPhone 4s with a bigger screen.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:59.520]   Actually, it's from Mike Gadget, M-I-C Gadget.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.960]   It looks nice.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:01.400]   Who knows?
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.800]   I don't know.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.760]   It looks cardboard, to be honest with you.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.840]   It doesn't look great.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:11.720]   Has Apple ever gone that far to build such a radically new device when they have so many
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.440]   useful devices already in the chain?
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.840]   Their history has always been bring up the new one and deeply discount the old one to
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.600]   keep all the Android customers in May.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.360]   So I honestly can say that I have no hard evidence one way or another.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:33.160]   But I suspect that we'll see an iPhone 4 that suddenly goes for $149 to $99 and an
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.640]   iPhone 5 or iPhone 4s that retains the same price point.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   All right.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.600]   Let's talk about the privacy issue because it broke this week that-- did we talk about
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.400]   this last week?
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   I guess not.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.920]   It happened after.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.320]   And I have to say, I downloaded-- there's a little program that you can download.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.880]   I posted mine.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:54.800]   I was a little disappointed with mine.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.760]   It didn't look like it was actual GPS coordinates.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   It looked like cell towers.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.760]   No, cell towers.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.760]   It's not GPS.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   So it wasn't very accurate.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.760]   It was cell tower.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   Well, I'll say it was.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:07.320]   I'll also realize that there are two different pieces of data going out here.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:12.800]   The app itself, the people who released that app, intentionally fudged the location data
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.880]   so that it could not be used for bad things.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.600]   That's why if you look at the results of your map, every single point seems to be on a
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   screen.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.600]   In a row.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   That's the degree of fudging.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.240]   They rounded it off.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.560]   However, the bad news is that the actual data is far more accurate.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.680]   The good news is that, like we've been saying, it's not GP-- it's not direct to the data
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.520]   but it's not getting information directly from the GPS radio.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:40.040]   It's getting information from cell towers, which it's then converting into a calculated
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.000]   estimate of what the GPS coordinate is.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.920]   That's really all it is.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.920]   And Wi-Fi access spots.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.920]   It's the A GPS.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.640]   It's the assisted GPS.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.120]   The Wall Street Journal yesterday, they've been really hot on the trail of this story.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:58.720]   They say even if you turn off location services, which makes sense because you're turning off
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:06.680]   the GPS, it will still collect and store that location data in the SQL database.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.680]   That was Apple's response.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.360]   It's what you can opt out by turning off location services.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.360]   The Journal says no.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.600]   In fact, actually, Apple hasn't had any response to this location gate except I'm looking again
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.960]   at MacRumors.com, a Mac room.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:24.520]   Again, you never know when somebody says, "Oh, I got an email from Steve Jobs if it's
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.240]   real or not."
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.920]   I like this with a grain of salt, but this is what MacRumors says.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   One MacRumors reader emailed Apple CEO Steve Jobs asking for clarification.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.960]   "Steve, could you please explain the necessity of the passive location tracking tool embedded
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.960]   in my iPhone?
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.400]   It's unnerving knowing that my exact location is being recorded at all times.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.600]   Maybe you could shed some light on this for me before I switch to a droid.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   They don't track me."
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.000]   Steve's answer, "Oh, yes, they do."
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.200]   This is the important part.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.880]   We don't track anyone.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.320]   The information circulating around is false.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.480]   If Steve said that, I don't think Steve said that because it's not true.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.560]   There's a file on your computer that has your tracking.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.280]   I don't think he would deny something that's paintly false.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:19.920]   Or it could be, "I did not have sexual relations with that GPS tracking database."
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.400]   It depends on you.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.120]   You have to say, "Okay, is Apple tracking users?"
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.360]   One possibility is they can say, "Well, no, we're not tracking the users.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.320]   We're just trying to build the database of Wi-Fi."
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.640]   We're trying to build the database of Wi-Fi hotspots.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   It's a skyhook.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.160]   Then you can then use exactly the skyhook database.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.240]   No, we're not tracking you.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.800]   We're just trying to build the database of these things.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.000]   Some guy forgot to purge the data of the cache as it should.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   There's a lot of them.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.200]   That seems credible to me, to be honest.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.360]   We're keeping.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.040]   The idea of skyhook is, if you've always wondered, "Well, how does it know from Wi-Fi
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.040]   where I am?"
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:00.200]   Well, skyhook is a commercial company that does this, that they basically drive around,
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   Google was doing it too.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.960]   This is how Google got in trouble, driving around, matching GPS coordinates with Wi-Fi
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.480]   access spots, having that information, then you could triangulate somebody's location,
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.400]   not as well as GPS, but pretty well with Wi-Fi only.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.840]   The skyhook database is used by a lot of companies.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.320]   I don't know if Apple uses it in the eye.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.000]   I believe Apple does use it.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.360]   Obviously, it would be way more accurate if you had every person using an iPhone, uploading
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.360]   information.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.960]   So all you need to track, if you're doing that, is not personal information, but merely Wi-Fi
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.600]   access spot name and GPS location.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.520]   And then periodically upload that to Apple.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.480]   That would be commensurate with the Apple TOS.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.400]   Was the data on your phone, Andy anonymized?
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.920]   Can you tell if it's you?
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:47.840]   If I looked at the database, I didn't say anything that I could directly link to actually
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:48.840]   my...
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.840]   Actually, my...
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.680]   I guess they know it's you because they're getting it from you.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   Right.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   They think they could.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:58.640]   See, there are two different and brick wall separated issues here.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.400]   Number one is why this phone is tracking is recording this data.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.240]   And I really think it's just something internal where it's saying, "Here's how we can basically
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.480]   improve the performance of our location services.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.400]   Here's how we can essentially rebuild this database that we don't now have to pay money
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.400]   for."
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.400]   And they do that.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.120]   And that there was never any intention of this file ever being seen or touched by anybody.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.520]   And so on that basis, people are being a little bit paranoid of being a little bit, you know,
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.760]   Glenn Beckish about what Apple is doing.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.760]   But the bad news is that it didn't take very long for no good nicks to figure out that,
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.960]   "Hey, wait a minute, there is a freely accessible file containing a rough track of where people
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.040]   where this user was and when they were there."
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:42.240]   Not only that, that if someone has not encrypted their iPhone backups, that means that if I
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.840]   have access to their Mac or their PC for just five or ten minutes, all I have to do is copy
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.880]   that file to a flash drive.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:54.680]   And I have nearly a year's worth of very, very good time-dated location data that I can then
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.800]   use for purposes that are probably not going to work in this person's best interest.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.760]   So I think that Apple is making a mistake by focusing on the, "Hey, we're not doing anything
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.760]   bad.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   We're not doing that tracking.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.760]   We're not doing this."
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.760]   They should acknowledge that, "Ooh, that's right.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:11.880]   That would be a bad thing for someone to grab a hold of if you don't want your soon-to-be
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.080]   ex-fouced to know where you were on a certain date or a certain time."
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.200]   I, someone was saying that if I, because I was twittering that I didn't care.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.600]   So someone said, "Well, you should post it."
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.560]   So if you go to borderstack.com, you'll see my maps.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.560]   Yeah, I'm here.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.560]   I posted all the maps.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:30.720]   So I just went, I went in and took a whole bunch of screen grabs of my maps and they're
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.720]   cool looking.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.880]   I was kind of disappointed that they didn't show some of my stuff in Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.640]   I have all of South America, I have Paris, I have a lot of places.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.640]   Brazil.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.320]   I was like, I was like, "I want to see the actual data instead of the fuzzed data."
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.360]   If Senate would be, it really would be you walking all over the street.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:53.240]   I will say that I definitely did not, when I posted my own screen cap, I think that should
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.520]   be a really good, like, there should be a really good, like, group-source map of where
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.400]   technology writers have been in their lives based on what they've put, screen shots they've
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.160]   posted of this utility.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.800]   But when I posted my own screen shot, I basically chose, here's the Cape Cod, because I already
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.200]   blogged about a little trip I took to the Cape in the summer.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.760]   But I don't want that, from that database, to be public.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:18.400]   Nonetheless, it occurred to me that, gosh, if this were a secure file that only I could
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:23.800]   get access to, it would actually be kind of useful to me to figure out how to do it.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.800]   It's awesome.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:30.440]   I just want to say, like, if I was in London a couple of months ago, and I found this really
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.280]   great restaurant, but I didn't write it down, I can't remember it, I can just simply load
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:39.200]   a really cool iOS app that say, "Hey, please rewind to where I was on this day and this
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   time."
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.120]   Somebody re-oriented me yesterday in San Francisco, and I forget what intersection it was, and
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.400]   that way I could go right there and say, "Oh, yeah, that's where I pulled over to get
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.400]   his insurance information."
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:54.120]   It would have been very useful to me.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.040]   Now, Android phones do do this, but they warn you when you first turn on the phone that
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.640]   they're going to do it, and you can uncheck that box.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.000]   Google also makes that information.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.680]   If you sign up for latitude or if you have a Google account, makes that information available
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.880]   to you so you can see it.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:10.600]   They're not hiding it, but at the same time, I think they're doing the same thing.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.640]   In fact, I think that's what those Google Street View cars were doing when they got
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.760]   in trouble for saving open access spot information.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.600]   They were just collecting the same kind of information.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.000]   I think it's going to be difficult to prove that this is going against the TOS.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.040]   No, and the TOS specifically says you can.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.040]   They are doing this.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.720]   Right, but I'm saying, all these people are investigating this.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.440]   I think these are politicians trying to make look useful, but I don't think that the bottom
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.880]   line is that when you hit, I agree, you are really agreeing to that.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.520]   They're not hiding anything from you.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.480]   I think it's very valuable that two senators are essentially putting pressure on Apple and
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:49.080]   Google to say, "Please come out in public and explain why you feel these devices need
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.840]   to collect so much information."
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   I know that there was, in the 81 pages of LegalEase people click through before using
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:00.320]   their phone, we did say that we will collect location information, but it really does need
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.720]   to be spelled out in a room.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.720]   Yeah, it's 35 pages.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   I mean, come on.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.040]   It's an education sort of thing.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.240]   There's so many totally innocuous reasons why a phone could be doing that.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.200]   Again, coming back to network performance and system performance.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:19.840]   They need to know why was, essentially, one person who worked for one of the big three
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.740]   carriers was trying to explain to me the other day exactly why one model of Android
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:30.240]   phone they have keeps and transmits really kind of sensitive location data back to the
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.240]   mother's ship.
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.600]   It's because that they are concerned about coverage in certain areas.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:38.600]   The only way they can figure out exactly where they need to improve their signals in certain
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:42.560]   locations is to have the phone report back saying, "Hey, on this date and this time
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:43.560]   I was in this location."
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:49.040]   Even though the network was saying that I should have good signal strength, I couldn't
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.840]   get anything anywhere.
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.680]   That's essentially where they figure out where to put their next strategy.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.760]   It's your phone saying, "Can you hear me now?"
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.760]   "Well, I hear me now."
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:00.000]   I think that one of the things for those of us on shows and more so for you, Leo, than
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Andy, than me.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.440]   Yeah, because we have cloud scores in the high 70s.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   Exactly.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.920]   I'm in the high 50s.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:12.800]   But what I'm saying is that if I want something to be private, I don't touch the Internet.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:17.680]   Well, I see it as soon as it goes on the Internet, I'm like, "Well, I say this on the radio.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.440]   If you're going to commit a murder, you might want to leave your cell phone behind."
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.360]   Because of course it's tracking.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:26.120]   We've talked the other day about color turning on the mic.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.120]   All of this stuff, of course.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.400]   But let's not dismiss this.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.400]   It's the same situation as if you have a home security system.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.200]   It's an incredible home security system.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.000]   Your doors are reinforced.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.320]   There's 5 million bit encryption on the encryption key.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:45.520]   But the company has a 48 key master password they can use just to do system maintenance.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:46.520]   You don't need to know that.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.280]   It's not a violation of terms of service.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.240]   But you better believe that people who have an interest in breaking your house know that
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.080]   there's a 48 character master password that has a one in six chance of opening any door
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.600]   that has that special sticker in the door cam.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:05.520]   I mean, that's why it's only just to basically put some baking soda on this fire.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.720]   Google and Apple needs to come up with something better than we are tracking.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   You'll agree.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.680]   I mean, it should be very clear.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.160]   It should be mentioned from time to time.
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:20.520]   You know, Apple's actually done that for a number of things where they say, "Now remember,
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.120]   we're doing this."
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.760]   And I think that that's appropriate.
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.280]   I guess people are saying, "Well, how can you be okay with this?
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.080]   I'm okay with it because I don't think it was nefarious.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.080]   I don't think it was."
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:34.480]   And besides, what are they going to do with 39.7 million tracking files exactly?
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.000]   I mean, what is it that you're worried about them doing?
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.120]   The worst case scenario they're giving is Domino's Pizza so you can get a coupon and
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.120]   you walk by it next time.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.120]   I mean, that's the worst.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.120]   Right?
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:51.400]   Well, I'm a little bit more paranoid about Google than about Apple because I was in London.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:56.400]   I was being driven past Google headquarters and I couldn't help but I strictly say, "Oh,
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.400]   that's Google."
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.920]   I thought that my movements were being monetized as we ground past throats of this block.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:04.040]   If there's a way to make eight tens of one cent...
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.040]   It's obvious.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.280]   Anything they ever do, they're going to figure out how to do it.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.280]   That's their business.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.280]   And so you have to look at what a company's business is and where they make their money.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:15.120]   Apple makes their money by selling hardware only secondarily by selling ads.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.680]   Google makes all their money by selling ads.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.520]   So of course, you've got to look at where the money comes from and that's what they're
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.200]   going to do.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.440]   I think that all these companies ought to let us know and I'm sure that the Congress...
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:28.920]   I mean, this is a big stink pile that they've created and Congress is going to absolutely
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.520]   jump into this and mandate it.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:35.680]   That's probably why the biggest reason it was a mistake is because now they've got Congress
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.280]   saying, "Well, you've got to do it."
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.280]   But I think they should do it.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.000]   They need to let us know.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:46.120]   By the way, the bottom line is if you encrypt your backups, your drive stuff on your drive
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.120]   is safe.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.760]   It's still on your phone.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:54.360]   We have... I keep waiting for Armageddon the day that the bad guys really start to attack
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:59.680]   cell phones because they're wide open and that's not the only data on your cell phone.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.560]   And it's just a matter of time before they get Trojans on our phones.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.320]   I keep waiting for that to happen.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.320]   I don't know why it hasn't.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:09.080]   Well, and I think that what's most important about this whole lesson is to continue to
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.000]   remind people that there is nothing that you can do that's connected to the internet
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.560]   or your cell phone that is private.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.560]   Exactly.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.280]   And so I think that having those reminders was important because it's good for people
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.680]   to continue to remind me, because people have this little thing like, "If I'm surfing
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.880]   at home, it's going to be fun."
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:29.520]   Or if I'm on a Wi-Fi in an airport, I'm sure that nobody's looking.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.280]   You know, looking through my packets or all of us are...
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.520]   Your internet service provider or wireless carrier knows all this stuff too.
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.600]   They know exactly where you are based on your tower location or your IP address.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.280]   Your ISP sees every packet that goes through.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.480]   Your wireless carrier sees every packet that goes through on the internet.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.480]   I mean, if you want to...
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.480]   You want to be paranoid.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.480]   You're cheating yourself.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.720]   When you see a pop-up window comp and go deals in Petaluma when you're surfing the
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720]   web, you know, you're like...
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.720]   Get the reel.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.200]   They just saw you go by and they have anywhere you were.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.240]   Facebook just announced this new thing that we're...
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.680]   coupon thing too.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680]   They're all doing it.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.840]   So I think it's a little disingenuous of the Wall Street Journal saying, "They're tracking
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.840]   you.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:10.840]   Of course they are."
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.400]   But I guess there are a lot of people, in fact I know there are a lot of people who
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.400]   don't know this.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   So it's valuable that this word go out, go forth.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:22.040]   And if you want to be private, there's a cabin in the Cascade mountain range that...
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.040]   With your name?
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040]   Private.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.040]   Privacy is such a granular and fuzzy concept.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:33.000]   I was kind of a little bit shocked when I was setting up that G-Slate tab last week.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.400]   Google has a really great system where you log in your Google account and it will re-download
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.400]   all your apps.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.400]   It will set it up for you.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.080]   Set up your Gmail account.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.080]   No tethering.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.360]   I'm going in 30 seconds.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.560]   I thought, "Hey, that's great."
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:50.720]   Until I realized that it was set up for 4G first, that it now had access to my private
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.960]   secured Wi-Fi network at home.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.400]   I'm like, "Why does it have access to my Wi-Fi network?"
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.400]   And I realized that when I tested another tablet a month or two ago, I said, "Please
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.400]   synchronize data.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.800]   It saved the password and cloud."
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:09.280]   And I'm kind of used to the idea of saying, "I'm used to the idea that something that
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.080]   private would not be included in the list of things that you're going to that I've
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.720]   given permission for this service to back up into the cloud."
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:24.400]   And so I had to go and reset everything because I don't want this beyond a Google server.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:29.840]   My password is pretty secure, but I don't want the idea that someone will guess correctly
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:35.400]   and suddenly be, "I try to think that I'm very, very careful about that sort of stuff."
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.880]   But even I made an incorrect assumption about what on this device would be kept private
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.640]   and what would be backed up and what would be made public.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.640]   So.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.400]   I mean, all these companies have a considerable amount of work to do with this area.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   Right.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.400]   Fasteners.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.400]   Fasteners.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   They're all fast.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.160]   But anybody who listens to this show by now should know that that's...
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:00.120]   And Apple says, "You can turn off location services, but get none of the benefits of
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.920]   location services and then you're private."
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   And so...
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.520]   And then the question is, "Why are you using your iPhone at that point?"
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.560]   If you turn off location services, it takes all the fun out of it.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.560]   Right.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.640]   Well, and even if you turn off location services, your wireless carrier still knows exactly
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   where you are.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.640]   Right.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.440]   Let's take a break, come back with more.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.120]   We're going to have to get Erfan to talk more.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   You're too shy.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.040]   I've just been absorbing the wisdom.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.040]   No, no, no.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.920]   That's not the point.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.160]   You could do that from the audience.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.040]   We put you up on the stage here.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.760]   No, it's our fault because we just basically are a bunch of gas bags.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:38.120]   I just encourage you to puncture the gas bag, hold your nose and come right in.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.120]   Okay.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   Water's warm.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.120]   Boy, that was a bad mixed metaphor.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.960]   Hey, let me talk a little bit about PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.240]   This is such a great solution.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.440]   I've been filling out PDF forms for my kid.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.720]   You know, camp is coming up and you've got to sign up and get the health forms and all
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.720]   that stuff.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:57.600]   And if you're lucky, the website will give it to you in a PDF format.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.160]   Not necessarily in any way you can edit.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.320]   Usually what they say is print this, fill it out, scan it, mail it back.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.120]   I'm not doing that.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.960]   That's why I love PDF Pen and PDF Pro Pen Pro from Smile Software.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.320]   Of course, I love Smile Software anyway.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.560]   I've been a big Smiles fan for years.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.120]   There used to be Smile on my Mac and now they're there.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.280]   They're smile and it still will make you smile.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:29.160]   You can get PDF Pen or PDF Pen Pro on your Apple App Store if you choose.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.000]   We don't happen to get credit for that if you do, but I'm not going to make it hard
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   for you.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.640]   Or just buy it online.
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.760]   It's a really great tool to make PDFs easy to edit.
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:44.840]   You can change the PDF without going back to the original Go Paperless with their built-in
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.240]   OCR.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.160]   You can add text, images and signatures all with your mouse or keyboard.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.520]   I have my signatures and my kids' signatures and my initials and everything.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.080]   I gave Henry a piece of paper and I said, "Sign this."
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.080]   I said, "Why?"
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.080]   I said, "Just sign it.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.080]   Don't ask questions."
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.920]   No, I said, "Because I have to..."
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.280]   Actually, is this wrong?
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:07.280]   One of the things he's going to this summer, they have a form where the kids supposed to
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.600]   read it and agree not to smoke pot, not to play his music too loud, be good.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.040]   They sign the contract and I just wanted to get the paperwork back.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:19.320]   I said, "Henry, just give me your signature.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.320]   I'll sign all that for you."
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.320]   I don't think that's the way it's supposed to work.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.320]   I think they're supposed to sign it.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.120]   There's something about signatures that you read out and have a sign and then scan it.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.440]   I'll just go over it with them.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.440]   How about that?
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.240]   I make him sign a copy locally.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.280]   Now I have his signature in my library on PDF pen, which is so great because I could just
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.480]   paste it or my signature in.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.520]   See the annotations?
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.480]   You can circle, draw on it.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:45.040]   Use correct text, do it all right within the PDF.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.240]   It's such a sweet tool.
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.240]   I just love this.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.440]   You're going to love it too.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.200]   PDF pen is $59.99.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.840]   PDF pen Pro is $99.99.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.480]   Add some additional features, but you can try it free.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.880]   Not in the App Store, but at the Smile website.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:05.480]   That's probably a good reason to go to the Smile website and give it a try.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.040]   Then we get some plug for it.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.440]   We have a bunch of mugs.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.440]   I got a mug.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.440]   Mugs.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.440]   Mugs.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   Mugs.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.440]   Mugs.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.440]   Not bugs.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.280]   Gene brought some mugs back to us.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:23.200]   Smile software.com/macbreak.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.640]   We ask you to use that Macbreak URL so that we get credit.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.160]   If you like it, just the fact that you went to this site, you could still then buy it
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.600]   on the App Store.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.360]   Try it free for 30 days and then if you like it, buy it on the App Store if you wish.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.120]   You don't have to.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:44.400]   I do like them on Facebook too because they're likable people.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.400]   I really...
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.400]   It's great.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:51.640]   Mac developers in general, I think, are the greatest people in the world.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.480]   Smile is a really good example of that.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.960]   So go to their Facebook page, which is facebook.com/smilesophware.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.200]   I'm going to press the like button.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.480]   Yes, I like them.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.760]   See, there's the mug that you got.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.120]   We should take a picture of that mug and send it out.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:14.800]   Oh, look, PDF pen is in the Evernote trunk.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800]   Don't buy it that way.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.800]   Buy it.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.720]   We want credit.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.280]   Get the free trial, smile software.com.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.960]   Smile software.com/macbreak then.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.520]   You could buy it anywhere you want.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.520]   Try it free this way.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.840]   Does that make sense?
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.840]   Download it.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.400]   In fact, this is a good time to download it.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.960]   If you've got kids and you've got to fill out those forms, download it and then you don't
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   even have to buy it.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   Download it.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.080]   We are not good at these ads.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.160]   I really got to work on my--
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.560]   Gene, I'm sorry, but I just love it.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.560]   I know they're going to buy it.
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.880]   It's great stuff.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.520]   Smile software.com.
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.160]   Nice people.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.280]   Slash.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.200]   Macbreak.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.560]   Macbreak.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.680]   Brings.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.400]   Apple's being sued over these tracking things, of course, that was only inevitable.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.040]   Oh, and by the way, one advice--
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.280]   I heard one security expert say, this is fine, just don't jailbreak your iPhone because
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.400]   then you're really opening it up to getting hacked and stealing that file.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:17.040]   Because people can do a remote login directly onto the device as opposed to needing physical
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.600]   access to your unencrypted file on the Mac itself or the PC itself.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:25.680]   On the other hand, as Erfun will, I'm sure point out there's an article on Cult of Mac
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:29.840]   showing you how to jailbreak and then stopping.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.680]   It's called an untrackard stops the iOS location data.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.160]   So untrackard is a jailbreak only program.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.440]   So if you are going to jailbreak, install this.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.480]   There you go.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.720]   There you go.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:49.680]   I mean, I think for most people, this whole tracking thing is kind of a non-issue.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.200]   It's definitely something that you should be aware of, like Andy said, but it's kind
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.200]   of like, "Antanoggy."
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.600]   I feel like this whole thing is being blown out of proportion.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.600]   Apple's doing really well.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.600]   They have lots of money.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.280]   People are going to sue them over this because they know they can get some of that money.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.680]   But overall, it's like phones track you.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.840]   They have GPS inside.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.680]   I mean, it's like, "What are you going to expect?"
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.880]   And plus, it's like, if you crash your car and you land in a ditch and no one knows you're
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.440]   there and they're trying to find where you are, you're often in the forest, then that
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.720]   GPS becomes very handy right so people can find you.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.320]   So there's good things about it too.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.320]   I lost my car one time.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.800]   I really wish I had an iPhone there.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.640]   You parked it in front of the liquor store and then forgot.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.240]   It wasn't because I was drunk either.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.800]   I'm just a little absent-minded at times.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.080]   You know, that's a good point.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.680]   I was in an accident two or three years ago and I had a minor concussion and I had memory
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.960]   problems for like six months and that happened to me too.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.600]   And you know, it's the strange feeling when you come out of a store and you have no idea
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.080]   in the middle of a city where your car is.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.080]   It must be awful.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.520]   And my iPhone helped me find it.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.280]   Well, and it's another point is if you use Find My iPhone, that's not going to work if
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.680]   you turn off location service.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:01.960]   I guess all I'm saying is, first of all, of course they do this.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:02.960]   What a surprise.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.360]   Second of all, I think every company now it behooves them.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.800]   It's really important that they at least let you know and periodically remind you we're
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.240]   doing this so that people at least have the choice.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.240]   That's all.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.440]   Not well, not only that, but if you're going to store that data for even for a completely
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:24.520]   legitimate purpose, be aware of the fact that this is an incredibly important file that
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.000]   needs to be secured against access from no good ceiling.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   And that was clearly a bad mistake.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   That was an error.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.520]   In our office when we have data like that and it can be private, you know, private company
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:40.880]   data that we've recorded or something like that, we call it fissionable material.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.080]   You know, like, you know, you know, we go, you know, we go, you know, we go, you know,
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:46.720]   so that's the short note, like when we hand them just like this, this contains fissionable
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   material.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.960]   And that means that there's a whole different set of rules that that apply to that to that
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.960]   data.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.760]   I'm more concerned about companies being stupid than actually being nefarious.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:03.200]   They're the Boston Globe just a few years ago, one of the worst breaches and first of customer
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.000]   secured data ever.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.880]   Because I guess they recycle paper like from the office like in the in the in the in the
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.040]   in the printing department.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:18.360]   So I so for an entire Sunday edition, like thousands and thousands and thousands of bundles
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.960]   of newspapers came with like a little top sheet that simply had, oh, this is zone eight
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.400]   four, 12, but it was printed off of the recycled paper that someone had used to print out
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.320]   a complete customer database.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.640]   Oh, no.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.880]   So basically every 50th paper came with a free list of confidential personal information
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880]   of all subscribers.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.240]   It was it was a bit of a black eye for the newspaper.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.320]   And it's already been reeling from a lot of a lot of hits in the past few years.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.600]   So according to Paul Allen and by the way, thanks somebody in the chat room.
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:54.140]   It's actually his channel in the chat room, somebody for passing this along from the unofficial
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.440]   Apple web blog.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.320]   Steve Jobs is monomaniacal.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.240]   This is an interview that Paul Allen did.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.240]   You know, he's got this book.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.120]   He's pedaling with a Sunday times.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:11.360]   He praised apples almost unbelievable turnaround since jobs returned to the company in 97.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.120]   But he also said the jobs is monomaniacal.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.120]   What a surprise.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.080]   Is he telling us anything we don't know?
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.440]   Oh, better than CEOs that are multiplied multiple mania.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.440]   Yeah, you don't want.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.440]   What is that?
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.440]   What does that mean?
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.720]   I think it means he likes to wear a monocle, right?
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.080]   And that funny hat that he wore.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.800]   People from personal Zeppelin that covers around the campus.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.280]   It means he is a monomaniac.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.800]   He has a monomaniac means he's got his he's obsessed with a single thing.
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.440]   And I think that actually that's probably fairly accurate.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.160]   He is obsessed.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.920]   And we are the benefactors.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.120]   And we are the benefactors.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.560]   So nothing wrong with that.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.120]   That single thing is awesomeness.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.200]   Oh, what a horrible, horrible personality trait.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.600]   Let me see.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.440]   He also had some nasty things to say about Google founders Sergei Brin and Larry Page.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.560]   He says, I chuckle when I see people pushing the boundaries all the time of what they can
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:16.120]   do to monetize things, capture things, and then say, we're not evil.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.200]   As if their default is not to push the boundaries.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.040]   This kind of talks to our privacy conversation.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.160]   He says, if your default is to push the boundary, go for it.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.760]   But don't say you're not evil.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.160]   That's a good, I think that's actually pretty.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.480]   I praise Paul for that.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.760]   I think he's he's actually fairly accurate.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.280]   Do you see the interview in 60 minutes?
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280]   No, I didn't.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.280]   Did you?
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.280]   It was good.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.280]   I'm dying to see it.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.320]   I'll go up to there's a 60 minutes iPad app is probably on there.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   Yep.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.320]   Yep.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.560]   The 60 minutes iPad app is actually awesome.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.720]   You can watch all the little segments by the I've kind of stopped watching on TV.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.440]   Oh, I shouldn't have said that.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:57.520]   No, I think they're probably just as happy if you watch it on the iPad.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.840]   If they're not, they better get happy.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.760]   Yeah, because they made it because it's kind of the future.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:08.880]   Erphon, where did you get this video of a guy who looks a lot like Steve Jobs?
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.440]   Like, gosh, if you haven't watched that, you should check it out.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:20.000]   So there was this video circulating on these Asian websites of Steve Jobs practicing his
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.280]   iPhone 5 keynote.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.640]   And it's this guy kind of far away.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.120]   He sounds like George W. Bush.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.360]   I'm just saying the most stupid things about the iPhone 5, like it's going to have its
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.520]   own version of smello vision.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.440]   And my favorite part is the very end.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.360]   He's like, I need my shoes, you know, so he don't his classic running shoes that he
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.360]   wears.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:46.240]   And he does this quick, like, in place foot shuffle and he compares the light-weightedness
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.600]   of his shoes to the light, airy weight of the iPhone 5.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.600]   And people thought this was real.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.600]   That is just bizarre.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.600]   That is just bizarre.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.600]   It's just bizarre.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.040]   I mean, the whole video, I'm wondering if it was made as a joke and people actually saw
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.360]   it and then maybe started taking it seriously.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.040]   This looks like the video that I shot at the iPad.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.040]   That's my actually.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:12.040]   Apple has designed digital technology.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.040]   Speaking of lighter, my barefoot.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.040]   Do you mean your shoes?
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.040]   It's coming up.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.040]   These parts great.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.040]   I think this is done in a high school.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.040]   That was a great life.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.040]   By the way.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.040]   Oh, they're so comfy.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.040]   Like an iPhone 5.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.040]   I have one barefoot.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.040]   Can we start from the top?
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.040]   Okay.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040]   He does.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.040]   He sounds like, can we start it from the top?
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.040]   Yep, we're going to do it again.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.040]   Someone's written a one man show that he's trying to get back.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.040]   That's what it is.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.400]   And then I like the page.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.640]   I can't read anything on the page, but it looks like I can get new.
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.440]   They need to have that guy at the next math world.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.040]   He needs to give the keynote.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.040]   Wow.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:55.640]   Wouldn't that be funny if Steve Jobs says you've all seen him on the internet?
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   Now here he is.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640]   Well, they are.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.400]   They are re tooling the Spider-Man musical.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   Maybe he's going to be like a teacher.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   Flying.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   Flying.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   Umm.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:12.880]   Mac users are more educated and less likely to ride Harley motorcycles.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:19.320]   I kept seeing this in my feed all week and I kept trying not to read it.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.000]   But I managed to somehow see it anyway.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.560]   I thought it was pretty interesting actually.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.520]   You think none of it was particularly surprising?
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.520]   It's from punch.com.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.880]   But none of it was particularly surprising.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.760]   It was all like, yeah, that's pretty much the one.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.560]   Well, that's why I kind of thought this can't really be true.
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.320]   I mean, it's like it's just what everybody thinks.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.320]   I don't know.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.320]   It just didn't seem.
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.320]   I don't know.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.480]   It kind of makes sense to me.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.600]   I haven't read the article, but aren't Mac users really into value, right?
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.800]   And Harley-Davidons are, you know, like not really a great value.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.400]   So maybe you wouldn't want to drive one, but you drive a Honda instead.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.920]   So the way they did this, I'm a member of punch.com.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.760]   They ask you questions.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.400]   I mean, there's other parts, other functionality, but part, you know, when you go to hunch.com,
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.880]   you'll get a bunch of questions.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.280]   You get answers as many as you want.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.600]   So they got 388,000 respondents answering these Apple questions.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.400]   And then they put together based on that, a profile of exactly what you would think,
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.320]   which turned out it was exactly what we are, exactly what we expected.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.800]   But it's kind of, yeah, I mean, it's self-referential.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.760]   It's all of us answering the questions.
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:27.280]   I'm trying to pull it up right now so I can give you the results on the blog.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.840]   And when did motorcycle ridership become a metric of consumers?
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:31.840]   I don't know.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.640]   It's sort of like the line.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.840]   And he's a person you'd most want to have a beer with.
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.840]   Oh, I don't think.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:38.360]   OK.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:44.760]   So of 388,350 hunch users answering the question, are you a macro PC person?
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:51.360]   25% admitted to being a Mac person, 52% PC people, 23% neither.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:56.720]   Among the PC, self-proclaimed PC and Mac users.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.120]   PC people 22% more likely to be older, 35% to 49.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.160]   Mac users tend to be 18 to 34.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:10.360]   36% of PC people are self-described politically liberal.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.400]   36%.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.040]   58% of Mac.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.400]   So they're young liberals.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.760]   52% live in a city.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:24.160]   67% have completed a four-year college trigger or higher, not me, not Steve Jobs,
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.680]   but the rest of you.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.960]   PC people are 26% more likely to fit in with others.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:37.080]   Mac people, 13% more likely than PC people to say they want to be perceived as unique and different.
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.080]   Of course.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.080]   So they have that in common, ironically.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.840]   Mac people are 50% more likely than PC people to say they frequently throw parties.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.320]   Or party animals?
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.840]   You frequently throw parties.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.080]   I do throw parties.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.880]   Andy doesn't seem like he throws a lot of parties, though.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.920]   I throw my stuff dog in for my Batman action figures.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.680]   We have a wonderful--
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.080]   It's a close personal, friends.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.080]   How about our open?
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:03.680]   No, they have.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.280]   You throw a lot of parties, Erfan.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.800]   Oh, all the time.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.200]   You're some parties throw parties.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.960]   When I was in college, I threw epic.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.000]   Please explain this to me.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:23.200]   PC people are 33% more likely than Mac people to say that two random people are more different
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.120]   than alike.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.560]   Mac people tend to say people are more alike.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.400]   PC people tend to say people are more different.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.400]   I don't know what that means.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.480]   That's because Mac people run into other Mac people and decide that they're all alike.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.480]   We're all alike.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.000]   Because you know that in an airport, you can walk up to a person with a Mac and start talking
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.280]   to them.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.440]   PC people are more mathematically inclined.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:46.280]   Yeah, because they have to figure things out themselves rather than having them.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.640]   There's a certain muscle in their brain that works better than--
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.160]   Dad, there's still no tip calculator for my Windows phone.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.360]   OK, let's all-- it's one of the desks that point over.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.640]   One place and then double the list.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:02.160]   So the Harley stat actually gave you a choice between a Harley and a Vespa.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:06.560]   And 69% of PC people prefer the Harley to the Vespa.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:10.040]   52% of Mac people prefer the Vespa to the Harley.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.600]   That in no way surprises me.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.840]   I'd rather have a Vespa.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.480]   You guys, Vespa Harley.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:15.480]   Vespa.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.640]   I'd rather have a Vespa too.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.920]   I think I'd look less stupid on a Harley.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:20.920]   That's about right.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:24.280]   One and four.
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:27.000]   I think it's just a size thing.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.200]   Once you're above 200 pounds, I think there's a certain--
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.120]   You look stupid on a big butt on the Vespa.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:38.000]   I think I take an almost daily constitutional.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.120]   I'm not in terrible shape.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:39.800]   But, yeah.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:42.000]   You like me.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.800]   We're beefy.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:49.680]   What the curse is, it's that picture of those twins on the little mini dirt bikes
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:50.680]   in the Guinness Book of the Year.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.680]   Yes, exactly.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.160]   You're not nearly as bad as that.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:57.120]   But you just somebody who's the same sort of cultural sponsor.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:00.800]   See, if they put a segue in there, I think we would have gone through the roof.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.840]   I'm saying, well, nobody doesn't look cool in a segue.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.200]   That's just that is just liquefied awesome liquefied cool.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:13.240]   PC people tend to perverse sweet snacks to salty snacks, Mac people vice versa.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:13.920]   Oh, God.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.080]   Slow news day, guys.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.080]   Slow news.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.960]   I resisted this.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.440]   I'm not talking about us.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.920]   I'm not talking about people in that office trying to come up with that poll.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:27.960]   If given a choice between shingling a house and mowing a dry.
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.160]   But that's what hunched does.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.360]   That's what hunched does.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:35.040]   PC people prefer Pepsi Mac people prefer San Pilla Greeno, Lima, not.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.040]   OK.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.040]   I can also.
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.040]   Now I know.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.600]   I think this is the worst part as I still win.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.600]   Yes.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.600]   Yes.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.400]   I like the limonata.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:50.000]   Mac people are more are 80% more likely to be vegetarians.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.320]   I believe that too.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.320]   We prefer hummus.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.160]   They like tuna fish.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.720]   They like strawberry daiquiris.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.200]   We like hot toddies.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.720]   We don't have enough money left over for meat.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.240]   Maybe that's it.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.680]   We're all we're all running hard.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.680]   Go ahead.
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:04.680]   Go ahead.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:05.680]   Black beans and rice every single night.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:06.680]   Pay for the iPhone.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.320]   They like white Zinfandel.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.320]   We like Keati.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:14.960]   Oh, I don't like white Zinfandel.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.800]   The majority of Mac people and PC people both consider their respective companies to
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:25.040]   be most responsible for driving the global growth and adoption of computing.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.040]   We did it.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:29.880]   No, we did it.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:34.320]   PC people like USA Today.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.320]   Mac people like the Times.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.360]   What are our opinions on Suzanne's summers?
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.360]   It's dope.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.360]   It's dopey.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.360]   Sorry.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.120]   I even brought it up.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.120]   It's dopey.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.760]   But it's, you know, it's fun.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:51.720]   70% of both people thinks she's had way too much cosmetic surgery.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720]   That's right.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.720]   We're going to take a break.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.720]   Come back.
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.240]   Andy has an incredible pick for us coming up in just a little bit.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.240]   I'm excited about this.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.240]   I'll pick.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.240]   We all should be excited.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.640]   Yeah, we all should be excited.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.080]   We all win.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.600]   But first before our picks of the week, and by the way, I don't know if Irfan if they
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.440]   told you, but just pick some software or hardware, something you like.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.200]   Oh, I've got one locked and loaded.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.720]   Locked and loaded, baby.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:19.520]   But first I want to tell you a little bit about my friends at FreshBooks.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520]   This should be my pick.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:26.640]   This was a lifesaver when Amber Mac told me about FreshBooks in 2004, seven years ago.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.640]   Because I was suffering.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:28.800]   I was in invoice hell.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.600]   It just was horrible having to do an invoice, actually several invoices every month and knowing
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.720]   if I don't do this thing I don't want to do, I won't get paid.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.240]   I still put it off and I still didn't get paid.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.240]   So FreshBooks came along.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:46.440]   One of the really best Web 2.0 sites early on.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:49.880]   I think Amber told me about the site, not because she wanted to save me time invoicing,
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.440]   but she said, "This is a great site.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.320]   This is just how sites, how web apps should be."
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:00.400]   Of course, 2 million people later, this is the invoicing place.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.720]   I mean, it's so great.
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.280]   Easy online invoicing.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.880]   TryFreshBooks.com and you will get paid faster because there's actually a "Play Me Now"
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.400]   button on the invoice.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:13.280]   You can use your credit card or online payment services like PayPal and authorize.net to
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.040]   pay you.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.200]   Automatic payments, if they agree, you can have automatic invoices and payments.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.920]   You just kind of completely step out of the way, let the computer is handling.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.160]   Let the robots do it.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.960]   Complete currency agnostic, it's just nice because I used to bill in Canada and the US
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:33.520]   and it was nice to not have to worry about which is which and it does a conversion automatically.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.680]   Automatic late payment reminders, in case your clients are not fast to pay, they can
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:39.200]   even print up paper invoices which is very handy.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.240]   Some of the older clients like those paper invoices.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.080]   It's professional looking.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.080]   It's easy to use.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:47.800]   If you bill by the hour, they've got apps on the web and on the iPhone that will automatically
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.440]   track your hours and then stick them in the invoice automatically which makes it so easy.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.800]   This is just a great way to invoice.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.720]   Try it free right now for the first three clients.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.720]   That's right.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:04.960]   Free for three and every week FreshBooks has a drawing among all the new users for a birthday
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   cake.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.840]   It doesn't know birthday necessary.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.600]   Birthday not included.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.840]   Easy online invoicing.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.480]   FreshBooks.com.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.120]   We love them and I know you love them too.
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.120]   They're fresh.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.120]   They're fresh.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.120]   If you're an invoicer, this is what you want.
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.080]   And I can tell you from personal experience that the cake is good.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.080]   You've had it.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.080]   I had it.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:28.520]   We had a producer, John Ryanley, actually he invoices us with FreshBooks and he got one.
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:31.160]   He actually called them and told that he called them and said, "I need you to understand
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.360]   that I am a producer on a show that you..."
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.680]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:42.160]   He called them and said, "After you won, he said, 'I am a producer on a show that advertises
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.160]   you.
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.160]   I shouldn't be eligible for this and they're like, 'Oh, we'll send you anyone.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.400]   We'll send another one out and we'll send you one and call it a day.'"
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.600]   You know, they were just, you know, they were totally...
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:55.560]   And then we went to the office and we had, "Have we ever received a birthday cake?"
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.560]   Uh-oh.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.560]   I don't believe so.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.560]   Well, he actually won the random.
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.560]   But he uses it.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.560]   Because he uses FreshBooks.
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.200]   And he signed up and he won as a user, them not knowing that he was a producer.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.200]   Got it.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:07.200]   And then he...
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.280]   But then he felt like he needed to tell them that to make sure that they were clear.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:17.280]   Irfan is locked and loaded with his pick of the week Irfan Elijah from the cultofmac.com.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.080]   What do you like?
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.840]   I have been using an app called WeightBot.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:25.240]   It's by the guys that made TweetBot.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.040]   They made Couldn't VertBot.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.320]   And basically it does one thing very well.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.040]   And that is it helps you track your weight.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.880]   And every day you answer your weight into this little app.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:40.840]   And then you can graph it and it shows you, you know, like as the month goes on, as the
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.160]   years go on, like how your weight is going up and down.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:50.120]   And I really love this lot because one of my goals in life is not to get old and huge.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.120]   Like me.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.120]   Like one of those things.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.120]   It works with my scale.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.640]   So wirelessly, if you have one of those whipping scales.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.240]   I think scales, which I do.
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.240]   I think scales.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.240]   That's how I tweet my weight.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.880]   Do you actually tweet your weight?
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.520]   Well, what do you think Leo's scale?
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.320]   It has to do something.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.320]   That's awesome.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.320]   Got to have some.
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:15.920]   So I use this because I also work out and it helps me know, you know, like if I need
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:21.520]   to increase my exercise load per week, I need to stop eating some like particular food.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:28.520]   And it's beautifully made.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:33.520]   The UI is fantastic as all the the tap bots apps are.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:36.520]   So I would highly recommend it's only two bucks.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.520]   Great app.
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:38.520]   It's a great.
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.520]   It's really great.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.520]   And I have to say that I have the the the the Y things scale as well.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:46.520]   And I'm slightly obsessed with you use weight, but I started with weight bot.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:50.520]   Why things has their own after their own that graphs and everything else that connects to it,
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:53.120]   just weight bot to track it every morning.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.760]   So if you don't have the Y things scale, you have to have I mean, weight bot is perfect
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.920]   because I would just type it all in every morning and I have to admit the type in it
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.000]   and I was like, you know, it'd be great if a scale was connected to my thing.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.440]   Except maybe in this makes you a little more aware of it.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:12.080]   Well, my whole thing is is what's what a lot of people tell you that that you should only
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.080]   do it once a week.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.080]   Right.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.080]   I like to do it every day.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.520]   And the reason that tools like this, like a weight bot and the why things are important
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.520]   is because it allows me to look at trends.
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.080]   So I get lots and lots of sample points.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.680]   So I weigh myself every day.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.120]   It's about five 30 in the morning.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120]   And so it's the same time.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120]   It's the same, whatever.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.640]   And I can see what my what my actually a good thing, you know, and and then I know
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.040]   when I'm getting in trouble, I've eaten too much.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.320]   And if you monitor it every day, then you can, you know, adjust as you go along.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:42.200]   Because it's not it's not that one day one day it can change as much as three or four
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.200]   pounds.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.880]   But if you have a whole bunch of days, it'll build a trend line that tells you, you know,
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:51.320]   kind of the direction, the the mean average, you know, the average of what you're doing
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:52.320]   over time.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.320]   And that's what you really need to know.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.320]   Exactly.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.400]   Wait, bought.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.960]   And how much is it?
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:58.960]   Two bucks.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:28:59.960]   Two bucks in the Fs.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:00.960]   I do say so myself.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.960]   I think so.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.600]   I bargain it twice the price.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.080]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.600]   So my pick of the week.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.480]   Let me open it up for you.
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.480]   Sure.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:11.480]   Sure.
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:12.480]   Sure.
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.680]   So I was going to pick something, but it's not quite ready.
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:18.800]   I was going to I was already to pick something and now I'm thrown off.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.800]   I can go ahead.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.800]   Go ahead.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:21.800]   Go ahead.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:22.800]   Go ahead.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.600]   So this actually came about a very roundabout way.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:30.400]   It was a free, you know, on the Amazon App Store for Android.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.920]   Every day they have a new free app, which is great because it's a great way to get an
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.920]   app free.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:35.640]   And so I check every day.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:39.440]   And they had this great radio app for free.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.120]   So I immediately tried it.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:48.840]   And then realized, oh, it's available on the iPhone 2 and it's just fantastic.
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.120]   Oh, you know, it's funny.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.840]   Do I have I installed it on the iPhone?
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.280]   I have it, but I'll show it to you on.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.600]   Please forgive me for this, but I'm going to show it to you on the Android phone, but
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.120]   it looks exactly the same on the iPhone.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:05.160]   And it is it is easily the best radio app and it's only like 99 cents.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:10.280]   So it's called TuneIn Radio and it looks exactly the same on the iPhone.
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:14.000]   So pay no attention to that Android like thing at the bottom there.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.520]   But it has a few things that I really like about it.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:19.080]   First of all, it does tie into the website, the TuneIn website.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.600]   Here's local stations.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.640]   A couple of things I really like.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:27.400]   One is if a local station has more than one stream, you can choose that stream.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.820]   So a lot of radio programs, they'll just take the first stream or they won't be an easy
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:32.720]   way to discover what other streams there are.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.680]   Here's our local classical station.
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:39.800]   And it gives me a number of choices, including 128 kilobits MP3 or AAC.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.920]   But well, the AAC is going to sound better, so I would choose that stream.
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:44.920]   That's really nice.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.320]   But look at this at the bottom.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:47.920]   There's a record button.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:51.760]   This is the first program I've seen that lets me record the radio stream as I'm listening
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:54.880]   to it for later playback in my iPod.
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.480]   I have to say that.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:04.760]   Well, I use it for shows like when I'm on a radio show and I want a copy of it, I can
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:08.720]   do with that or I mean, it's just it's just a people are still believing or not.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.960]   I know it's hard to believe, but people are still looking for ways to record radio.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:15.840]   It seems kind of old fashioned, doesn't it?
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:20.840]   Now that we have podcasting and all that, it also ties into their website where there's
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.880]   a directory of 50,000 radio stations.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:29.200]   So you can create a, you know, a directory for your tune in radio.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.240]   They have home versions.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.720]   They have mobile versions.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:36.680]   I have to say this is absolutely has podcast to were on it.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:38.280]   So it could be your podcast listener.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:44.360]   And I know one of the problems on the iPhone is that there's no easy way to download podcasts
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:45.360]   over the air.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:49.600]   Well, here's a way to do it with this tune in radio thing because essentially it streams
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.080]   the podcasts to you as if you were watching them.
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:58.240]   The website is tunein.com.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.000]   You can of course, it's on the app store for iOS.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.440]   It's on many other stores and you it does integrate.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.640]   You can log into your tuning account on the web so you can set up your app with directories
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.840]   and so forth.
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:13.400]   I think they've done a really nice job.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:18.160]   This I've been, you know, there are a lot of radio apps for the iPhone.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.160]   I've used a lot of them.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.200]   Receive has one, but this is the best I've found so far and a really good price.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.040]   Most of them are about five or six times more expensive.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.840]   That's tune in if you want to listen to radio or podcasts on your iPhone.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.960]   I like it a lot.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:32.960]   Are you ready now?
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.960]   I'm ready.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:34.960]   All right.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.880]   It's an app that I was going to we'll do it next week.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.880]   I just it's just not it's not quite finished yet when I was tested.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.680]   I liked it, but not quite yet.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:45.800]   So anyway, so one of them is really fun is called have you seen percolate?
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.800]   No, percolator.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:55.600]   It's percolator on on the iPhone and it is a it's a really interesting little, you know,
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:00.440]   app that basically just it's just like a little filter app that creates kind of fun versions,
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.840]   fun views of your photos.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:05.480]   So here's a here's one you can you can show here.
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:09.480]   This is it makes like big circles and stars and kind of converts them.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:12.560]   I use these a lot for my my wallpapers on my iPhone.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:19.480]   Like I want something that's kind of impressionistic, but not so yet a little sliders down at the
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.480]   bottom.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.480]   That's my that's my daughter.
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:24.480]   I just took a picture of her taking a picture of me, but but you can but if you change those
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.800]   little sliders at the bottom, it'll change the resolution.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.920]   It'll change the type of of what it's of it's using.
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.840]   You know, this is 99 cents or dollar 99 or something like that.
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:38.640]   And it just creates kind of fun little images that are, you know, of course based on the
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:41.080]   on the base image that you gave it.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.080]   And and I have fun.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.440]   I make a lot of my little wallpapers with it because it's subtle.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:51.960]   It's not like a photo photo and but it is a but it's kind of fun to put as a for wallpapers.
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.440]   So that's that's one.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:00.240]   And the my other recommendation is just a repeat recommendation because I've I recommended
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.000]   this a couple years ago.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.440]   And sometimes I feel like I have to go back and say, yeah, I'm still using it.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.440]   Still here.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.840]   So it's a little bit of a subscription.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.640]   So I think it's free or it's really cheap to buy.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:14.240]   But so if you're traveling a lot, I use the gold mate.
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.240]   Do you use?
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.080]   Yes, we talked about this before.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:19.920]   We've talked about it a couple years ago and called world mate.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.920]   A world mate.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:21.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.280]   I always think it was gold right.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:30.280]   And I just have to say I was I was traveling all over the world over the last three weeks
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:34.180]   and I would not have survived it without that because what happens is you just forward
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:38.280]   all of your itineraries as you buy hotels and everything else, it scrapes the data puts
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.360]   it into a into a workable database and it has all your confirmation numbers and all
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:43.880]   the phone numbers and it and it updates.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:44.880]   Is it on here?
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:45.880]   You want me to show it on here?
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.800]   It updates you faster than the airport.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:54.720]   Like like literally you'll know that the flight has changed gates before the airport
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:58.360]   right updates its monitors and so let me see.
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.120]   I don't know if I can show old ones.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.120]   Let me see.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.440]   I just want to use trip it for.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.440]   So here's.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.440]   Do you like trip it?
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.440]   Or have you ever tried trip it?
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.680]   I played with it and I just found that this one while I'm paying a little bit for it, I
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:11.520]   found that it now this is an old trip.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:12.520]   This was the biggest trip.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.520]   There it is.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.520]   There's all this stuff.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.520]   But the thing is is that you click on one of those.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.520]   You can go ahead and put everything.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:17.520]   This is old.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.760]   So it shows you, you know, exactly what time and if anything changes, it's like a little
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.940]   It's an active connection to all of those things.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:23.780]   - That's right.
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:25.280]   - It tells you, it shows you what kind of
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.160]   playing you're flying, you know, all of those things
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.480]   and it-- - After the airport.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.100]   - Yeah.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:32.440]   - And it's just, and I just have to say,
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.860]   I was just like, oh, I'm so glad it is expensive
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.900]   if you don't--
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:38.320]   - That's the main reason I stopped using it.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.440]   It's kind of pricey.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.140]   - It's pricey if you don't.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:43.280]   So here's what I'll say, is my comparison to Tripit is
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.720]   if you're an occasional traveler I find that Tripit is awesome
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.420]   but I found that if I'm doing it all the time,
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:53.240]   this was a slightly more fluid and was worth, you know,
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.720]   whatever 20 bucks a year to do it.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.320]   So anyway, that's it.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.840]   - I will grant you that gold.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:02.120]   And as I said, if you travel as much as I do,
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:03.840]   if you're not, then it's not that big of a deal.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:04.400]   - Right.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.240]   - So.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.640]   - That was really awesome.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:08.720]   I just got to say.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.240]   - It's real great gold.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.160]   - Yeah, it's--
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.520]   - And what was the name of that other, the photo?
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.920]   - Percolator, percolator, 'cause I got the whole coffee
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.720]   metaphor going there.
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:23.100]   Now, the highlight of our show today,
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:26.260]   Ande and Atco and Neil Gaiman.
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:28.580]   - Yes, I'm really excited about this.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:32.420]   This is our first collaboration since, I think was 1994
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:36.340]   when I, Neil and my new message pad collaborated
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:40.100]   to do a series of poems as he tried to autograph
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:43.340]   my newton with the stylus and I forgotten
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:45.100]   to turn off handwriting recognition.
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:47.260]   So it kept turning his signature into increasingly
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:49.980]   interesting and odd things.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:52.660]   And he was really assigning with the McCain
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:54.340]   and he was like, this is wonderful.
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.500]   It's like it's something the Oracle looked demified.
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.780]   - Now, now what's going to happen?
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:02.340]   - So I still have on my newton a series of poems
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:05.620]   that Neil wrote that he himself does not know exist.
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:07.740]   So at some point, that's my retirement fund.
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:11.460]   I'll take a nice, have a nice hand tooled bronze hammer
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.100]   like bookcase for him.
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:16.380]   - I knew Gaiman as interpreted by the Apple Newton
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:18.540]   and a team of dancers.
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:20.060]   But yeah, this is our second collaboration.
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:23.500]   There's going to be a 10th anniversary edition
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:27.500]   of American Gods and for the 10th anniversary.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:30.060]   - Great book, lovely, lovely, probably my favorite one.
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:32.500]   I think the one the highest compliment I can pay
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:35.700]   is that it won't take unless, for me,
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.780]   it won't take unless I'm in exactly the right mood.
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.180]   I need to have, like, I need to be in the chair.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.540]   I need to have hours which I can focus on it.
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:43.820]   It's not going to be one of those,
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.220]   oh, I'm waiting in line in the bank.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:47.300]   I'll just open up the Kindle app and read a couple of chapters.
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:50.580]   No, I've got the jacket on, I've got the pipe, no tobacco.
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:52.580]   And if I need to be holding a pipe on it,
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:54.900]   it's just such a really wonderful immersive book.
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.980]   So they're doing an audio, HarperCollins Audio
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:38:00.100]   is doing an audio book edition that's going to be fully cast.
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:03.340]   And I'm proud to say that I do have a small role in it.
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:04.180]   - Yay.
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:06.580]   - There's only one small detail.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:09.180]   I do need to get about 1,000 vote votes
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.820]   on a promotional website.
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:12.300]   And if I'm in the top 20,
[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:13.820]   then the producers will listen to.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:15.060]   - I think we can do that. - The audio demo
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.060]   that I uploaded.
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.100]   - Yeah, well, it's scriptly and biling.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:19.860]   You know, it's more like just to keep it.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:22.060]   They make it look fairing again.
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.620]   Neil and I are incredibly intense.
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:26.020]   - Are you saying you've already won?
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:29.500]   I'm as good as one because every Mac break weekly listener
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:32.940]   is going to go to neilgammon.bookpirk.com.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.500]   (laughs)
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.660]   Is going to click on the ears.
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:40.900]   This is actually the page for my online edition.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:43.580]   Going to look for me next to
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:46.020]   Consolo and Carbonite right up there.
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:47.620]   - I'll get a memo right there.
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.660]   - There you go.
[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.700]   That's my edition.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:54.140]   Unfortunately, you do have to click,
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:56.300]   fill out an online form in order to vote.
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:57.980]   But the good news is that you can vote
[01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:01.220]   like every single day between now and May 2nd,
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:02.900]   next month, which is on Monday,
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:04.420]   which is when the voting closes.
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:05.420]   I currently have about two--
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:08.900]   - I'm just looking here, Andy, at whose?
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:10.260]   Number one is Joseph,
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:13.180]   then Melissa, Rachel, Bradley, Kyle, Melissa, Andrew.
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:14.460]   Is Andrew Kit no?
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:17.180]   Melanie, Clarissa, Mike, Ash.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:19.060]   You're not in the top 20, dude.
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:20.620]   - Well, and I hope to fix that.
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.820]   Unfortunately, I didn't know about this
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:23.300]   until a little bit later in the game.
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:26.620]   I only uploaded my demo about a couple of days ago.
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.740]   So I met like 200 and something votes.
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:30.340]   I believe I'll need about 1,000 more
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:31.620]   to place in the top 20.
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:36.780]   - Now, how do we find your particular entry?
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:38.660]   - Well, you can either hit the search box
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:40.140]   and look for an not go or--
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:40.980]   - Okay.
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:41.900]   - You can actually post,
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.020]   if you want to take a look at it right now,
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.300]   I've pasted the URL to my demo,
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.620]   actually in the show notes.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.460]   - Oh, okay.
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:49.780]   - Scroll to the very, very popular--
[01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:50.780]   - I'm gonna get the show notes.
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:51.620]   Oh, those.
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.380]   - Everybody, everybody, and if you want to--
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:54.580]   Oh, this in your solve by all means,
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:56.140]   there's 20 people who are gonna be listening to,
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:56.980]   so that's perfectly fine.
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:59.380]   You have to, there is a paragraph of text
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:01.300]   that you have from the book that you have to record.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:02.660]   - That's a good idea.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.780]   - Right, and then you simply upload it to the site.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:07.700]   Some of these are actually very, very cool.
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:10.300]   I record, I was cautious enough that
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:12.220]   after doing a couple samples on my--
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:15.220]   (laughing)
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:17.980]   - That's from my insider behind the scenes tour,
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:19.460]   if that's the relate magic.
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:20.300]   (laughing)
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:23.340]   - It's the thing here, Han Solo and carbonate prop.
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.860]   If you don't go out in front of the prop,
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:26.380]   there's you have to be inside,
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:28.580]   that's where they magic to get that close to the prop.
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:30.660]   - I think most people would try to duplicate
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:33.060]   Harrison Ford's expression there.
[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.340]   I don't know if you were trying or--
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.180]   - I don't know if you did.
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:37.340]   - It just feels spectacularly.
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:38.580]   - It seemed like on some basis,
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:41.580]   Han was just trying for a cheery wave.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:42.700]   (laughing)
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:44.300]   Let's also do a cheery wave.
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:46.740]   - Ah, yes.
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.580]   - Cheery wave.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:48.940]   Shall we listen to your--
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:49.780]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.140]   - Entree.
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:52.940]   - This is Andy and I go only 211 votes.
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:54.860]   We got to get more votes for Andy.
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:58.980]   - Shadow was not superstitious.
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:02.460]   He did not believe in anything he could not see.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:06.180]   Still, he could feel disaster hovering above the prison
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.020]   in those five--
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:07.860]   - I've punched the word disaster.
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:09.300]   - He has to see it sheltered in the days.
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.300]   - That's what the pro would do.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.740]   There was a holiness in the pit of his stomach,
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:16.460]   which he told himself was simply a fear
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:18.460]   of going back to the world on the outside.
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:19.500]   - Now I don't want to spoil this
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.020]   by playing the whole excerpt.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.020]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:23.580]   - So I mean, that's good.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:24.420]   That gives a tease,
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:26.180]   people are not going to be interested in listening
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:28.780]   to all 53 seconds of it.
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:31.780]   So like I said, you can also,
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:33.980]   so go neilgammon.lookpurk.com.
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:35.860]   If you want a slightly longer essay
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:38.860]   about my desire to sort of work into this contest
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:40.860]   and sort of try to see if I get this role,
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:42.700]   I can go to an octo.com
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.220]   where I have a blog post about it.
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:46.820]   I've also made a, just,
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:49.540]   you know, I know that you have to fill out a form
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:50.780]   in order to vote for this.
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:51.620]   I know that you're going to--
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:52.620]   - I'm doing it right now.
[01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:53.620]   - I think okay.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.220]   - So to reward people,
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:57.620]   if I do wind up in this top 20,
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:00.140]   I will record an hour long audiobook
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.420]   of a public domain text,
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:04.580]   one of my favorite public domain books from Google Books.
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:07.700]   I will record a minimum of a one hour audiobook
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:09.620]   and release it for free under creative comments.
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:10.860]   If I'm in the top 20,
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:12.100]   if I'm not in the top 20--
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:12.940]   - That's so obvious.
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.300]   - I'm sorry, I'll be doing it.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:15.300]   If I still,
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:16.860]   (laughing)
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:18.180]   no, see listeners,
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:21.020]   I'm just sort of just asking politely.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:22.340]   - That's very nice.
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:24.540]   - You're charitable people and, you know,
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:25.940]   I bet that it's,
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:27.300]   I'm not sure if it's a union gig,
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:28.860]   but if I get $30 for it,
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:31.220]   you know, that I'm a freelance writer
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:33.620]   and a rapidly collapsing market.
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:34.620]   - 30 bucks goes a long way.
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:35.740]   That's a lot of top round-ups.
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:36.900]   - Folks.
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:37.740]   - So you don't,
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:39.660]   you have to create the account before you can search
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:42.260]   for Andy's family submission.
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:46.460]   And Andy Inako spelled I-H-N-A-T-K-O.
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:47.820]   I have no idea--
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:49.100]   - And you spelled it right there.
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:49.940]   - I did?
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:53.620]   I-H-N, see, even I.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:54.460]   - I think I'm not,
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.780]   search for, I'm not the rather than Andy.
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:57.140]   I think my username technically is.
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:58.300]   - Just Inako, I-H.
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:42:59.380]   - Yeah, find the view there.
[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:02.780]   - I-H-N-A-T-K-O.
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:03.620]   Let's try.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:04.460]   - Here it is.
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:05.300]   - There it is.
[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:06.140]   - Yep.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:06.980]   - There you go.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:07.820]   - And so ladies and gentlemen,
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:10.180]   let's just vote for Andy Inako.
[01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:13.100]   A vote for Andy is a vote for Peace, Love.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:14.340]   - Freedom of the amount of peace, yes.
[01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:16.060]   - And the American way.
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:19.700]   - In the end, I decided that if I don't get this role,
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:20.860]   I can deal with that.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:24.260]   If I didn't do everything I could to cheat and stack the deck
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:26.020]   and find being that top 20,
[01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.340]   I would be disappointed myself.
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:31.540]   I wanna not get this role because professional voice casters
[01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:34.060]   listen to my sample and said, no, no fricking way.
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:36.740]   Not because I wasn't devious, schemingless,
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:39.820]   and amoral enough to press every fan that I have.
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:42.740]   - So come on, come on board the boat to hell with me.
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:44.220]   It's only a small sin.
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:45.980]   If you've been leading a relatively clean life,
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:47.740]   I'm sure it won't tip you over the edge.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:48.580]   If it does, you know what,
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:49.660]   you're probably gonna go there anyway.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:51.460]   So why not have some fun?
[01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:52.340]   - Awesome.
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:53.180]   - From you, Boom.
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:55.220]   - Already 264 votes, Andy.
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:58.300]   Five more, five more votes.
[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:00.300]   Just from you mentioning that on the show,
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.220]   I think that's pretty exciting.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.260]   That's a testimony to you, Leo,
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:07.620]   and the power and the kindness of the Mac break weekly audience.
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:08.660]   - Can they list that?
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:09.500]   - Do they list that?
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:10.340]   - Hey, hey, hey.
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:11.180]   - Yeah, they do, right?
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:12.020]   - They're 74 now.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.140]   - They're not updating it live,
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.540]   so you have to sort of have to keep peeking back
[01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:17.380]   every few days.
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:18.220]   - Ah.
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:19.060]   - But I mean, you won't know.
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:19.900]   - So you won't know.
[01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:21.500]   - The heck with Jerry Lewis, this is the love network.
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.220]   - Can you vote more than once?
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:25.060]   You can vote every day.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:26.540]   - Okay.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.260]   So I'm gonna vote again.
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:29.460]   Oh, I guess I've already voted today.
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:31.700]   - What's the expiration date again?
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:35.580]   May 2nd, the contest ends,
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:38.340]   or the sampling ends on May.
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:40.260]   And after that, they will listen to the top 20
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:41.260]   and make their pick.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:45.900]   And producers, the fact that I am a well-placed media source
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:47.820]   with 50,000 putter followers,
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:49.940]   and in a great position to promote this project,
[01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:51.660]   this wonderful, wonderful project,
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.820]   this should, I want to make sure you cast me
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:55.420]   on my merits as a voice player.
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:57.780]   - Absolutely, and that hissing sound you hear behind him,
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:58.780]   that won't be there.
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:01.580]   - American Gods, what a great book that is.
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:02.780]   - He's now at $296.
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:03.740]   - Yeah, he's doing all right.
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:04.580]   - It's cooking.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:06.100]   - Keep up the work. - Good work.
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:06.980]   - Go Andy.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:09.980]   - And if you haven't read American Gods, do read it.
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:12.540]   And then Good Omens, which was the Terry Pratchett
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:15.980]   collaboration, is that like a sequel to American Gods?
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:18.100]   - No, that came out, that was, I think,
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:21.460]   Neil's first full-length novel that came out in the '90s.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:22.660]   But yeah, I mean, for God's sake.
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:25.580]   The "Nail Game" is one of those few authors
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:28.100]   where with his name is on it, I'm bonnet.
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:30.100]   It's not even, I don't even need to sample it.
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:32.460]   I don't care that this is Coraline, the first thing.
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:33.460]   Well, that's a children's book.
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.340]   - No. - Yeah, but it's the
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:35.540]   "Field Game" and so I think it's, no,
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:37.100]   this is awesome, okay. - Yeah, awesome.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:39.460]   - As a children's book, you should not read to your children.
[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:40.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:42.700]   Unless they're a little macabre.
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.180]   - Just to keep the sewing, just hide the sewing equipment
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:48.380]   for the next 11 years of their life, so they don't.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:49.580]   - No sewing. - No sewing.
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:51.100]   - No sewing.
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:53.220]   All right, everybody, thank you so much for being here.
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:56.220]   Thank you, Zach, I'm Zach.
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:57.060]   (laughing)
[01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:57.900]   - Let's do it one more time.
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:00.260]   Thank you, Earth and Elijah, for joining us from
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:02.300]   cultofmac.com.
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:03.940]   - Absolutely my pleasure, thanks for having me.
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.900]   - Everybody should visit cultofmac.com.
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:10.140]   It's a great site, great source for wonderful Mac knowledge.
[01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:15.140]   Andy and I, coke, good luck with your campaign, your drive.
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.620]   - Yes, again, you know, I'm sure it's a big treat
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:20.940]   for Neil as well because, no, it's not really a treat
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:22.460]   for him as well, I'm pretty much a nobody,
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:23.740]   but still, it'd be nice for me.
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:25.940]   - I think it's a treat for Neil, I do.
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:28.860]   Well, life is a treat for you, he has an awesome life.
[01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:29.700]   - He does.
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:31.620]   - Reaping the fruits of his hard work and creativity.
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:33.140]   - As he should.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:35.580]   Alex Lindsey's at the PixelcorePixacore.com
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:37.820]   for that great guild of multimedia artists
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:38.860]   learning and working together.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:41.660]   And borderstack.com is your blog, Pixelcore.tv
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.620]   for the podcast.
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:44.500]   - And a reminder that I'll be speaking
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:45.820]   and hopefully we're gonna be streaming
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:50.820]   the 3D advertising summit in May 13th from Corona Optical.
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:53.700]   So if you're in the Bay Area and you're interested in 3D,
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:55.540]   this is the place to be.
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.500]   And if you are in the Bay Area on the 13th,
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:59.540]   come a day early, 'cause May 12th, I'll be speaking,
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:02.700]   I'll be the host actually of a very exciting TEDx.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:03.740]   - It's all happening to Marin.
[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:05.660]   - Yeah, this is in Marin.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:08.940]   It is going to be a lot of new media types.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:10.180]   That's why they asked me to speak.
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:12.060]   The Communication Revolution will be the
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:14.340]   topic of Olivia Ma from YouTube.
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:17.460]   Robert Tersek from the Oprah Winfrey network,
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:19.500]   Jennifer Sebel-Nusum, who's a filmmaker,
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.180]   John Perry Barlow, who's just the greatest
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:24.980]   co-founder of the EFF and I'll be the host.
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:27.060]   That is May 12th in Marin County.
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:28.900]   - Where is that, Marin?
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:29.740]   - Good question.
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:32.660]   I should find out the Canbar Center for the Performing Arts,
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:36.540]   but if you go to TEDx Marin.com, you can get all the details.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.820]   There, I don't usually plug my speaking engagements,
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.620]   but this is a TEDx is really fun.
[01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:41.460]   - I'm gonna go.
[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:42.300]   - I'm gonna buy.
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:43.140]   - Yeah, please come.
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:43.980]   - Yeah.
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:44.820]   - Love to have you.
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:46.900]   And that's my good friend.
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:48.860]   What's his name is producing it?
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:49.940]   So that's gonna be great.
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:50.780]   Hey, let me.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:52.580]   (laughing)
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:53.420]   - Sorry.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:54.260]   (laughing)
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:56.660]   - I didn't come out nearly as well as you might have planned.
[01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:58.940]   (laughing)
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:01.700]   - Kirk Olson is his name.
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:02.620]   I remembered it.
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:06.020]   Let me just real quickly show you that in fact,
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.900]   this is the TuneIn radio program I was talking
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:10.980]   and if you go to talk radio, I wanna show you this
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:12.620]   'cause you might be confused.
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:16.860]   If you go to talk radio and you go to technology,
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:19.740]   you will see, look right there, Mac, break weekly.
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:21.100]   So this is a way on your iPhone,
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.860]   even if you haven't downloaded them ahead of time
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:23.780]   and subscribed,
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:25.300]   you can listen to our Twit livestream
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:28.180]   but also listen to previous episodes of Mac, break weekly
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:29.180]   streamed right to your iPhone,
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:31.220]   even if you didn't have the foresight
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:32.620]   to download it ahead of time.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:35.100]   So that is a very nice feature.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:37.020]   There aren't many ways to,
[01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:38.500]   I guess MediaFly is another way you can listen
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.260]   to our podcasts on the iPhone without having subscribed
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.380]   earlier.
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:47.380]   This is a really nice little program for listening to radio
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:50.180]   and there's our show on it, just wanted to mention.
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:53.060]   Mac, break weekly is live every Tuesday at 11 a.m.
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:55.420]   Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern Time at live.
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:56.740]   .twit.tv
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:58.260]   and you can listen after the fact,
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:00.660]   all sorts of places including on your iPhone
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:03.420]   or on iTunes or the Zoom store,
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:06.140]   should you still be using a Zoom?
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:07.220]   But do not attempt to define us
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:09.820]   on the PlayStation Network, it's still down.
[01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:11.460]   Thank you for joining us, we'll see you next time.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:13.780]   Another, what do I say, I say.
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:14.820]   - Yeah, get back to work.
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:15.660]   - Break time is over.
[01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:16.500]   - Break time is over.
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:17.340]   - Break time is over.
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:18.180]   - Break time is over.
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:19.020]   - Go bricks.
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:19.860]   - What they say.
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:22.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:25.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:29.060]   - I just wanted to say Andy,
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:30.900]   I love those sideburns you have.
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.460]   Every time I see those things, I think,
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:34.420]   man, I wish I could grow a nice pair of chops,
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:37.340]   just like that, to complete the full package.
[01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:40.100]   - You see, I never know, I do get that sometimes.
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:42.780]   I never say, you know, I feel like one of those
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.780]   like inspirational characters in the movie
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:48.220]   that the lead character meets like for just five minutes.
[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.860]   Like, you know, you had the power of growing sideburns
[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:53.180]   but then you all of them.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:55.780]   - I was telling Andy, I was like from the right angle.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:57.180]   - Magical eyeglasses.
[01:49:57.180 --> 01:50:00.100]   - I was telling the end of that, from the right angle,
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:04.300]   you actually look like Wolverine's good-natured uncle.
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:06.700]   (laughing)
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:08.500]   - That's very good, that's good.
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:09.860]   - I really like that.
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:13.140]   - Although at a comic con, like a writer
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:15.020]   who I really, really like, unfortunately,
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:17.620]   he said, "Hey, wow, those are great Wolverine mutton chops."
[01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:20.100]   And I felt as though, given the context,
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:22.900]   I had to say, "No, I did not grow these out
[01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:26.100]   so that 24 hours a day I could look like Wolverine.
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:27.820]   I did it so I could look like Isaac Asimov."
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:29.540]   - He did, however, he did, however,
[01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:32.540]   get the Adam and him fingers put in for that reason.
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:34.340]   That's the different story.
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:36.020]   - We do need a picture of, Andy,
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.620]   you need to be having a high resolution picture
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:39.740]   of you holding out your hands like claws.
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:41.180]   - Oh yeah, we could add them.
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:43.140]   - And give me a mean look.
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:44.780]   - So what I need you to do is I need you to take
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:48.460]   a picture of yourself with like claws at the screen
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:50.220]   with a mean look on your face
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:52.900]   and we'll make you into Uncle Wolverine.
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:54.980]   - They are accurate in one respect.
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:57.420]   It says, "These are the people that I influence,
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:00.500]   my daughter and my scale."
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:01.340]   (laughing)
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:06.340]   Yes, my scale has a clout factor of 31.
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:11.180]   - Man, you know you're popular when your scale
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:12.420]   has a clout back there.
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:13.860]   - Of course I influence my scale.
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:17.380]   Every time I step on it, I don't understand how they...
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:19.220]   - Well you're definitely asserting dominance over it.
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:21.380]   - I am very in your face sort of mind.
[01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:22.780]   - I would have stepped on you now.
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:25.020]   - When it comes to getting weighed on the top,
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:26.620]   I just gotta say that.
[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:28.580]   I'm sorry, there's a guy in the chat room named Shorty
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:32.140]   who says, "He has the same amount of clout as my scale."
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:33.140]   (laughing)
[01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:34.900]   I'm so sorry.
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:36.220]   - Maybe one morning you should step on him
[01:51:36.220 --> 01:51:37.220]   and I don't think, yeah.
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:39.460]   (laughing)
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:41.580]   Feeling a little lighter today than the others.
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:43.780]   - And then he can just tweet, ouch.
[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:46.220]   (laughing)
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.620]   - It's not the way it's the red stiletto heels.
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:49.460]   - Ouch, ouch.
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:50.300]   - That's what I should do.
[01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:52.740]   You know what, I'm taking over that stupid scale account.
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:55.940]   Every day I'm gonna type my way, I'm just gonna go, oof.
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:58.340]   - Oof, little to the right.
[01:51:58.340 --> 01:51:59.180]   - Little to the right.
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:00.020]   - Little to the right.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:00.860]   - Bacon Leo.
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:02.780]   - One at a time please.
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:03.620]   (laughing)
[01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:04.780]   That never gets old.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:06.220]   (laughing)
[01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:07.300]   Right between the shoulders.
[01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:10.060]   (grunting)
[01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:11.220]   (laughing)
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:13.180]   (laughing)
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:14.020]   Okay.
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:14.860]   (beep)
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:17.420]   - Plout, clubs and social rewards coming to a host.
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:18.780]   It was one of the most social rewards.
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:20.940]   - But you have to like Twitter like 25 times.
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:22.260]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:24.180]   - Yeah, I was like, you don't really understand Twitter.
[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:25.580]   - You get a reward for each offer you tweet,
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:26.900]   you get 10 points,
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:28.220]   for each offer that your friends purchase,
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:29.660]   you get 250 points.
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:31.540]   Accumulate enough, they can be redeemed
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:33.700]   for free rooms, dinner, for, oh screw that.
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.100]   This is basically advertising.
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:35.940]   - That's not good.
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:36.780]   - They don't even give you cash.
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:38.100]   - No, there was somewhere else that it was,
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:40.220]   well, we're talking about it on this week of media this morning.
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.540]   I have to find out more information.
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:44.100]   - That's the thing, that one, that's why I wasn't mentioning it.
[01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:45.980]   'Cause I already saw that article.
[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.660]   I was like, maybe not this one.
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:52.700]   But if you're listening and you are from one of these hotels,
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:55.100]   we think that a high cloud score would be really great.
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:56.300]   - No, let's go, if you're listening
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.940]   and if you're one of those hotels, give me a free room.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:00.940]   - Hey, I know some CEOs that I'm gonna tell you.
[01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:02.660]   - I'm just saying, forget the cloud.
[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:03.900]   Give me a free room.
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.980]   (laughing)
[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:06.820]   - I don't need a number.
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.060]   - Why add the middleman?
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:09.620]   Give me a free room.
[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:10.940]   - So, so.
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:13.100]   - I don't need no sticky number.
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:14.340]   - Listeners in the Las Vegas area,
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:16.900]   if you have a sewing room or one of those arrow mattresses,
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:18.300]   by all means, I email ask the other,
[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:21.540]   I would like to stay in your room for one to seven nights.
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:23.940]   (laughing)
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:25.620]   People pay one-tenth rack raise.
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:26.460]   - Do you know how much?
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:29.180]   - You will also leave behind one phone charger of your choice.
[01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:31.060]   - One of the reasons that I don't gamble is,
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:32.820]   'cause when I go to Vegas, I drop a lot of money
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:34.620]   without gambling.
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:35.460]   We just-- - He just drops it
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:36.300]   on the ground. - I mean, he's--
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:39.540]   - Well, I mean, it's to go to do like NAB or CES.
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:42.020]   It's at least 50 grand in hotel rooms.
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:43.780]   So, that's why--
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:45.580]   - Give me a free room.
[01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:48.700]   Okay, now let's begin the show.
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:49.940]   - That's a show title.
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:51.140]   - Yeah, it would be if it were in the show.
[01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:52.060]   - Well, you'd always do show titles
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:54.260]   that are based on the pre-show instead of the actual show.
[01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.580]   - And people listen to the whole show go ahead,
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:58.020]   they never said that, they never said that.
