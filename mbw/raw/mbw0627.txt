[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   This week on Mac Break Weekly, Leo is still out, and while he's out, we've got the Apple iPhone
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.920]   September event to talk all about. We don't know what these different letters under the iPhone
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.400]   10 number mean, and we also are really, really impressed by a new Apple Watch Series 4 that might
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.960]   help all of us to not die prematurely. All this on this week's Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. I am not Leo Laport. I am somewhere to the left of Leo Laport.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.760]   I am Andy Unaco because Leo is off on vacation. He abandoned our country at the time when Apple
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.360]   decides to drop big loads of technology on us all at once. But first let's take a look at our panel
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.000]   for today. As usual we have Alex Lindsey with us from the Pixelcore Alex.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.840]   Notice how Leo leaves right during a hurricane. He's like, "I think I'm just going to get
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.920]   go somewhere else." How does he do that? Someplace with barges where you can have fine dinners.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.440]   Exactly. I'm on basically protein bars for the day because I'm going to be behind this microphone
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.080]   in one form or another for about nine hours. So I'm not sure that's cool to be.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:36.160]   And spilling the empty seat that is left by Renee who is at this moment probably reminding
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.960]   himself of how savagely he overbooked himself for this press day is Kelly Gamont. Kelly,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.160]   how are you? It's great to have you back. I'm glad to be sitting here. I will do my best to try
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.240]   to stand in for Renee. I don't have enough watch bands but I'm going to do my best.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.360]   Do you play Pokemon Go? I do, dude. There you go. So we can make sure we can break.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.920]   Unfortunately he usually has that conversation with Leo because Leo is also a Pokemon Go player.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.440]   I can make up names of the five Pokemon that I think I remember and you could just simply play
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.560]   along. But we need to interject that. We'll have to read double if we can't talk about watch bands
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.360]   but you have to talk about Pokemon Go. We will miss Renee in a myriad of ways but maybe we can
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.560]   sort of dull the pain a little bit with a little bit of Pokemon Go talk and clear alcohol of some
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.000]   sort. So never bad. As long as you're behind a microphone as opposed to behind the wheel of the
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.120]   car, it's always an option on the table. Elon Musk proved that it increases your search ability
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.880]   and your discoverability of that podcast. So it's something we should definitely talk about.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:04:01.200]   Yes, Apple did have their September traditional iPhone event with a thin menu of announcements,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.160]   all the stuff that we kind of expected and not to say that those announcements were bad in any way
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.920]   or disappointing. But it wasn't a very, very protein-filled meal for an event that lasted
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.720]   the traditional 90 minutes. So before we start talking about all the Apple Watch series 4
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.000]   and the new iPhones, let's get to some more broader topics. Number one, how did we watch it this time?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.080]   This was sort of a new experience for Apple in that they allowed people who don't necessarily
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.000]   own Apple devices to stream it. They had some sort of cockamamie system where if you
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.600]   followed and liked a certain tweet from the Apple Twitter account, you could stream it through
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.280]   Twitter. Did we all, I just watched it through Safari using picture in picture on my MacBook.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.960]   Alex, how did you watch it or did you? We were covering it so I watched it through whatever
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.800]   Twitch had. So I assume through Safari or from an Apple TV. So I think that that's how we saw it.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.320]   And I think the problem Apple really had was that they don't get enough press and they don't get
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.600]   enough coverage and they don't get enough people watching their release so they had to expand that
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.200]   market to Twitter. I don't understand what happened there. Kelly, how did you watch it?
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.440]   I watched it on my Apple TV sitting on my awesome couch with my awesome sound system
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.320]   and with a friend of mine. So that was actually a lot of fun to get to watch with the buddy as
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.480]   opposed to usually when I'm just sort of sitting there by myself going, Tim, what about this?
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.280]   Like this time I sort of had somebody else to sit with me and go, yeah, I know. So that was nice.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:51.040]   Yeah, so basically we all, despite the freedom that was allowed to us by our lords and saviors
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.120]   in Cupertino, we still decided to keep that yoke on and kept grinding at the Apple logo to
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.960]   Millstone, I suppose. And another new thing again through Twitter was supposedly again,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.160]   if you liked a certain tweet that the Apple account that never tweets anything interesting,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.960]   tweeted out, they would like sort of live tweet it for you. And I did that and I didn't see anything
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:22.000]   actually filling up my Twitter console. So are they sort of playing with us at this point?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.040]   They're saying as opposed to here is a link that will any modern web browser will be able to stream
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:36.400]   everything live, which seems to work for every other sort of live tech event that I tend to watch,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.640]   that they basically trying to dangle this in front of us just to show us how terrible life
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.560]   outside the Apple Echo sphere is going to be. I mean, this is disappointing.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.400]   Twitter is not really a great platform to stream on either. I mean, not for long form. So I think
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.080]   that Periscope and streaming to Twitter is a great platform for very fast, kind of bite-sized
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.760]   meals of live streaming. But I don't think that it's formatted necessarily as great for
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.640]   any kind of high movement or other things. So I think that was kind of an odd choice,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.800]   I think, to use it. I think that one of the things that a lot of companies try to do is figure out
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.440]   how they're going to use this social thing. So trying to figure out where YouTube, Facebook,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.720]   Instagram, Snap, Twitter, all of those, how do they all fit into one place? And so I think that
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.560]   it sounds like Apple's experimenting with it probably at the behest of Twitter. So I think that
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.520]   there's probably a little collaboration there going on. But I think that it is, I don't know
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:42.480]   why someone, there are some reports that you are able to now see the stream on Chrome,
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:49.120]   if not just Safari, even if Apple's streaming it. So I'm not sure if that is, I haven't tested
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.320]   it myself, but it sounds like they've done a little work there. But I think that
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:00.880]   for the Twitter folks, I think, is mostly trying to get out to the social network as opposed to
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.840]   making it available for non-Safari users. And I'm not sure what benefit that gets them,
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.520]   because it's really something that they have probably the most viewed
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:17.200]   launch events of any company ever. So those broadcasts, I don't know what the numbers are,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:23.440]   but the broadcasts are probably in broadcast levels, like commercial broadcast levels of people
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.680]   watching. And you're kept in video. So is there any technical reason why they could not stream it
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.880]   to anybody who has a device with a web browser and a pulse? Is there any advantage that they're
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.120]   giving viewers by making it mostly an Apple only device event?
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.600]   It's just that the way their platform works, it's a Mac centric. It's iOS Safari. It has to do
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.840]   with the HLS network. So that's the reason that you, they only do it. But I think that, as I said,
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.760]   there's been some rumors that other things have been going on as far as experimentation goes.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.600]   But it's mostly why should we work harder because everyone's going to come watch it anyway.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.080]   And I think that that's the issue. It's the same thing. I mean,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:10.080]   YouTube, I mean, while it goes to lots of different things, Google streams on YouTube,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.480]   Facebook streams on Facebook, Apple streams on its own platform. So it's not really any different.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   They don't really have an upside to supporting other platforms because it's just more work.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.160]   And when I say that, I don't mean more work like, oh, they couldn't have done it. It's just that
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.920]   it's another point that could fail. It's another thing that might not work. It's another thing that
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.720]   might not look as good. You're much better off if you have the opportunity to do something where
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.320]   you can make it great and just pay attention to that one place that is important. Most companies
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.480]   don't have that luxury of saying, I'm only going to put it on my platform because they don't have
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.280]   that option. So they put it on everything and it's kind of lukewarm everywhere. Apple has the
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.240]   ability to just say, you're going to watch it here. So I think the Twitter was most likely an experiment.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:05.600]   Okay. Now, Kelly, this was a really significant Apple keynote. I cannot remember, even in the days
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:13.280]   of the famous lost iPhone in the German beer hall, I cannot remember a previous keynote in which
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   so much was leaked out of Apple where so much of it was not just simply a good solid rumor,
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.840]   but absolutely we had this absolutely locked. We already knew we already seen the pictures of the
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.280]   new Apple Watch and side views of the new phones. There was another one this morning.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:41.440]   I'm looking at Mac rumors report, a product site map XML file hosted on Apple's website was
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.880]   shared by all things how, including URL links that confirmed a handful of previous rumors
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.040]   surrounding the trio of 2018 iPhones and upcoming Apple Watch. As a matter of fact, I copy and
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.240]   anticipating that was going to have to be taking lots of fast notes during the event.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.360]   I actually managed to create a full outline of everything, including names, including sizes.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   So I wouldn't have to write down those details. Were you as hip to this as everybody else was,
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.880]   it was like everybody knew it was those surprise. Yeah, I saw that stuff come out and I say kind
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.400]   of the same thing every year, which is that I'm not into it. I don't care so much about the rumors,
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:28.080]   the only time I used to care is when somebody would get, and this is the old old days, like well
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:35.040]   before Mac OS 10 and all of that, when you would have somebody who would post something online and
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.680]   it would be maybe 30% right. And then they'd get the takedown notice from Apple. And that's how
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:48.640]   you knew like a tiny bit of something that you might see was somewhere in whatever it was that
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.240]   got posted. And I kind of missed those days because I, one of the things I was linked about
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.600]   the events is being surprised by them. Like what's Apple up to next? What are they doing?
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.360]   How is this working? And what's sort of funny to me about it is that we've heard the double
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.840]   down on secrecy thing, and it seems like since we heard that, we just get more stuff in advance.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.400]   And so like whether it's inadvertent or not, I mean, I know the Time Magazine Sunflower iMac thing
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:22.320]   was an accidental thing that we weren't supposed to see the day before it came out. But in these
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:30.960]   cases, I sort of wonder this time around what exactly happened in that there was somebody that
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.080]   it was like screen caps of marketing videos or something, like the product videos or something
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.640]   that somebody had put out on some stream and that's how they got a hold of them or something. I don't
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:48.480]   remember. But I'm sort of disappointed. I understand why everybody wants to get in on it and why
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.680]   everybody wants to find out about it ahead of time. And I want to know now and I get that. But at the
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:02.960]   same time, for me anyway, I prefer to not have any idea and for the one more thing to be a big deal
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.240]   and for there to be a one more thing that nobody knows about and finding out what that kind of stuff
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.800]   is like. And at the time, as opposed to having known all of it yesterday or this morning when I was
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:22.000]   making coffee and like, oh, look, all the stuff leaked. So for me, it's kind of a bummer. But on
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.400]   the other hand, so many people care and so many people are trying so hard to find out ahead of
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:33.280]   time. I feel like I should feel good about that because there was a point when an actual conversation
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.880]   about like, if I buy this Apple laptop, is it going to be the last one that exists? Like,
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.080]   you know, and so like on the one hand, it's nice to have that evolution from the one end to the
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.560]   other. But on the other hand, like I miss those days when things could be a surprise.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.160]   Yeah. Well, and I think that part of it is the supply chain is so large now. And there's so
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.320]   much pressure that I think a part of it is keeping track of that. And it does sound like somehow
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.760]   the either stills or video got out from marketing. So that wasn't necessarily a supply chain issue.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.920]   But a lot of these leaks are supply chain. I definitely don't think Apple is doing this,
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.000]   but I would point out of how much of a news cycle they're able to man, you know, maintain for two
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.120]   weeks before the event. I mean, that is just incredible, an incredible amount of earned views
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.920]   for, you know, for a product launch. I mean, most people just are kind of surprised when Samsung
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.240]   does its launch. Oh, yeah, they did that today. You know, and for weeks before Apple, you know,
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.080]   this comes trickling out. I don't think it necessarily hurts Apple to have, you know, that much of the
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.520]   mind space over those periods that period of time, you know, to pay it off and make sure that you
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.920]   have something. I think today, the probably one of the bigger announcements that we didn't really
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.800]   see a lot of was ECG that that coming out was not something that at least I saw in some of the
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.120]   rumor mills. We obviously knew Apple has been working closely with the FDA. And when you think
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.560]   about that, that's probably what they were talking about years ago when we were talking about those
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.360]   meetings happening between the FDA and Apple. So they were talking a lot of the stuff. We're talking a
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.880]   long time to mature. And we'll talk about that later, but we're talking about the electric
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   cardiogram for gram feature in the in the series for Apple Watch, which was a big deal. Can we talk
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.440]   about that? It is it is weird, though, that this is they didn't they didn't just step on the rake
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.680]   once but twice. And it wasn't we're used to the idea that as we get closer and closer to the actual
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.040]   event date, so like you said, so many people get have to get clued in on this that it's inevitable
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.280]   that you're going to get some really, really good rumors that maybe you can start to believe
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:39.760]   it is so unusual to see that this wasn't just some engineer who was drinking and a phone slipped
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.800]   out of their pocket. And that's how it happened. It's like, dude, there's a you there is a you put
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.840]   a file on a server that could be accessed by people who are not at Apple. And you name the file in
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.320]   such a way that if you were looking for something, they would find it. This points to me that perhaps
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.560]   there was a break or a leak in the system that you might want to use some of that miracle putty
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:05.680]   that the advertise on TV to patch before the next big before the next big event. But but I'm also
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:11.600]   I'm with you too, Kelly. I don't tend to I don't really talk about a write about rumors on my own
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.520]   because it's not terribly interesting. You're gonna find out one way or the other on on September 12.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.480]   And even then if we knew that we did know that there's going to be a 6.1 inch iPhone 10,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.120]   there's going to be a couple of different models. There's there some models are going to be discontinued,
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.680]   but you need to know the context of it. You need to know the story that Apple tells around it
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:37.200]   because you can't really make a guess one way or another like that. Another thing that really
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:44.640]   struck me about today's event, it really did seem kind of padded out. There was a lot of videos.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:53.120]   We saw the disembodied voice of Johnny I've we I guess that they they they they're not done
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:59.360]   moving him into the new spaceship campus. They didn't they haven't gotten the white void that he
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.640]   usually records video from installed and completely running yet because you saw his you heard his
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.080]   disembodied voice above a couple of videos. There were a nice funny long
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:17.440]   funny long emission impossible intro with a couple of good gags in it. And a lot of like now
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   we're going to recap and explain all this stuff that we just sort of explained to you already.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.400]   That was the hardest part was that these videos you're just kind of like Megan and I were talking
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.920]   about it on the coverage. It was just like okay so we're getting a video that highlights everything
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.320]   we were just told. I mean there is the the idea that we're going to tell you what we're going to
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.200]   tell you then we're going to tell you it then we're going to tell you what we told you that
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.720]   is a classic idea but it really felt like it was like we're going to tell you what we're going to tell
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.880]   you and then we're going to tell you it then we're going to tell you it again and then we're going
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.640]   to tell you it again and then we're going to tell you it again and then we're going to tell you it again
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.920]   and I felt like there was a lot of over coverage of of the same data. It seems like
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.360]   part of the we're going to tell you and tell you again used to be like in a little different way
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:03.200]   or with a little bit of context or like with a different example and in this case it sort of felt
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:11.120]   like everybody's checklist was the same which was the part that I was sort of like I did more than
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.800]   one time during the coverage kind of go you told me that already like not only did you tell me that
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:24.160]   you told me that a minute ago like I was down to my then so I'm like what I wonder if there's a
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.400]   concern that you know a shorter event would be like well they didn't do very much you know like
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.800]   we're kind of used to we're coached or not used to coached but conditioned into thinking that
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.440]   an apple event is going to be about two hours and if the apple event was one hour or one hour and
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.840]   15 minutes it might get pressed for being short you know maybe not much to say but but I definitely
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.280]   felt like you know especially when we're dealing with a lot of the stats when they're talking about
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:53.280]   the CPU and the GPU and I'm in the CPUs and GPUs and I even I wasn't interested I was like okay what
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.960]   does that mean I mean it means that we're able to separate the background from the foreground we're
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.200]   able to open up your apps 30% faster where you know and we spent I felt like we spent way too much
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.320]   time talking about the technical which is what Steve always said it's not about it's not about
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.480]   CPU speed it's not about you know those things it's it you know like let's talk a little bit about
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:14.400]   that and then move very quickly to how does that benefit you as an as an end user and I don't think
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.080]   they did get to that but I just think they didn't get to it fast enough part of that is that they
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:26.400]   also did it twice I think because we got it all with I don't know the letters I honestly don't care
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.880]   because I'm sort of mad at Apple for giving like once they finally establish a naming convention
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   then they burn it all down and I'm kind of happy about that yeah why isn't it just an s
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.320]   um and an s plus like what was wrong with that system people understand what that is now and
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:50.640]   what it means and now we have the the 10 3ds or bbq or triple x or I don't know anyway yeah I
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.240]   I'm like on the one hand I'm grumpy about that but also like we got the new 10c
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:02.080]   like it's the one that comes in colors but it doesn't have quite the horsepower of the the big one and
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:08.000]   when we got that we went through all of the exact same stuff as opposed to just giving me a
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.360]   reference of like just like we gave you in the 10 ds just like we gave you in the 10 se 30 just
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:21.680]   like we gave you in the in the iPhone air here like instead of just saying this is what it was
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.480]   like we had to get that whole breakdown a whole second time with that other phone and I'm like
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.120]   I just don't care you told me it comes in colors it's the C yeah you're not going to give it that name
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.800]   and I'm grumpy about it but now you're going to tell me all of the stuff that you just told me
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.000]   about the previous phone about this one and I'm confused by it yeah because what I wanted them
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.680]   to spend time on was where they were different like here's how we're doing all of this with the
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.320]   one camera in the color one you know where all the other phones that do this take two cameras like
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.040]   that's an interesting thing to me and we never talked about it yeah it was a very hard worse and
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:01.360]   gajidi techie specific sort of demonstration I'm surprised we didn't see more here is what and by
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.600]   the way since ios 12 is going to be released on monday let's let's show you how some of these
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:11.200]   features really apply with this wonderful a 12 bionic processor so just i i'm glad it's a
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.800]   seven nanometer for a cpu i'm really happy for you i'm sure that you had a big cake that said seven
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:24.480]   and and m as when you finish this but show show me show me things things happening faster and show
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.680]   me augmented reality that i couldn't really do with last year's model um we're going to go
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.440]   we're going to go to a commercial and after that we have a correspondent on the ground who is just
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.800]   who is actually there on the spaceship and has actually been in the demo romance can give us some
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:47.280]   hand feel and maybe mouth feel uh they still let you taste the the stuff in the demo room
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.840]   maybe that's the reason why i didn't go this year we're going to be hearing from
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.680]   we're going to be hearing from steven a keynote from the accessible podcast
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:04.320]   and wonderful tech blogger uh but this but before that we have a message from the absent leo
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:10.000]   la port leo can i jump in here for a second to tell you about wordpress uh i think it's so important
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   to have your own site your own home on the web a place you own a place you put your best content
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.800]   your best foot forward that's true for an individual even more true for a business right if you're
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.880]   business and you don't have a website hey come on join us in the 21st century it's time
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.280]   maybe you've avoided it because it's way that's too complicated i don't have web expert i don't
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:35.520]   want to have to do that's why you know you got to go to wordpress.com when i needed a website i had a
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:41.520]   you know an idea of what i was looking for i chose wordpress.com because there were basically there
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:48.720]   were no limits because it is the number one system for the web i mean 31 percent of all websites
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.520]   run on wordpress it's the best supported it's the easiest to use i'll give you an example
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.280]   i'm going to put all the images from my vacation i'm on vacation right now on wordpress.com i'm my
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.880]   my site leo la port.com which runs on wordpress.com and i'm going to do it in an automated fashion

[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:19.440]   way with uncertain bandwidth to get stuff on the website awesome right that's wordpress.com i can

[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.040]   unit one we're gonna call you mobile unit one because that's what the local newscast usually say
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.520]   you've just emerged from the from the mothership tell me how was the event for you
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:54.960]   hi andy um things were fine at the event um i thought the two most important things were the
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.480]   apple watch series four and uh the the iPhone 10 hard
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:12.400]   did you get to interact with anything in the demo area they were making a big deal about how the
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.240]   this we're gonna be talking about we haven't started talking about uh any of the hardware yet
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.600]   we're just going over like initial impressions actually what what was the temperature of the
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.560]   room like were people really really excited or did it feel like there was things that were kind of
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.640]   getting stretched out where were people uh still interested even when they were showing all those
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:42.960]   videos i don't think so i was in the room and it felt like uh as soon as they started doing the
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:52.320]   game demos and all the videos that that that people kind of started to check out some
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   yeah i i wasn't fully dressed at the start of the uh at the start of the show i just i simply had
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.600]   i'm wearing like you know a a shirt over another dress shirt and a tie and with what with all like
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.960]   the videos and all like the game demos i'd plenty of time not only to get fully like dressed out of my
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:16.400]   like usual like freelancer hanging around the house all day at our but also to change my tie
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.760]   and choose a different like jacket that's how it went uh did you get to spend time in the demo area
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:37.280]   uh very short time i i got a chance to look at the op-full watch series four and whole week out
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:48.960]   for accessibility that apple watch is a huge upgrade how so well starting with a
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:28:00.640]   larger screen uh if you're somebody with low vision as i do um that
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:11.360]   bigger screen on which to see your content and tell time is just gonna be super helpful um
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:25.840]   also the new fall detection feature is gonna be huge for uh people also like me who are prone to
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:34.480]   falling um it's it's gonna be a huge deal well are there any other devices already
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.360]   whether it's a phone whether it's a standalone device that gives you that kind of a feature where
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.680]   it can detect if you've fallen and let you easily call for help or call for help automatically
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:54.880]   well there are those feature those uh standalone devices that you can use for uh
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:05.440]   fingers who fall um they're not exactly the same thing but um as far as anything else i think apple
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:14.800]   watches the fruits well now is it is it any kind of a a drag or uh or even even something worse
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:22.320]   that uh a watch that it can be so helpful health wise to so many people and safety wise
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:28.800]   so many people still requires that you own an iphone or not even an ipad will do do you see that as a
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:40.240]   as a problem for people um well yeah certainly for people who might be interested in the op-full
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:50.800]   watch who aren't interested in an iphone um i i think someday at some point apple's gonna have to make
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:30:03.200]   the watch a stand and stand alone um product i'm not sure how they do that but certainly
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:16.000]   you know it's possible to not be into the to the iphone but what the apple watch for all the
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.720]   health and fitness stuff and uh then you're kind of stuck so overall what were your impressions
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.640]   about the announcements today about anything that you anything you saw or anything that occurred to
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:40.560]   you well um as i said i i think for the topic that i cover and um most interested in i think the apple
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:54.080]   watch uh kind of stole the show um i'm very interested to check out the iphone um that's um i think
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:31:05.920]   the tenor is gonna sell well um but you know again um as far as as far as what was announced
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:16.000]   um i didn't see anything with the iphone that was really earth shattering um it seemed like it's a
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:26.080]   chip of google s here and you know uh but you know again certainly apple watches the star here
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:32.960]   yeah it's a it's an s this year it's an it's an x-year and s-year and our year
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:39.440]   yes i can i still can't get this look at these all straight i actually i literally have like a
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.880]   note taped up to the side so i can remember which one is which and the only one i have straight
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.480]   already is just xs means that's the expensive one that's the only way i can remember this stuff
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   yeah access r yeah it's it's a lot of uh letters there
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:05.680]   what where you was there anything that kind of disappointed you about the event was there
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.960]   anything that you hoped that apple would push forward on but seemed to delay or something that
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.400]   they could have talked about that it's coming up they didn't talk about
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:24.960]   i was hoping they were talking about that air power map yeah they didn't talk about that they
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:34.240]   didn't talk about air pods uh which i would have you know enjoyed um i'm gonna guess as far as you
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:43.440]   you know anything else uh there could be a second event in october or you know other stuff happening
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:51.520]   but uh it kind of seemed you know kind of like a
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:33:02.720]   muted event for what it was you know yeah i was kind of wondering if there was something that they
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.120]   when they were first planning this out that they hoped that they'd be able to announce
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.120]   but then they realized it wasn't going to happen and so they had to sort of fill the rest of the
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:18.000]   time that's just that was just an impression but i wasn't there it was certainly possible
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:26.160]   they didn't talk about ipads um which you know they would have fit in with the whole iOS theme
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:34.880]   but you know again i guess we'll have to wait yeah we should mention the people who are listening
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.120]   that steven is being very very generous because he's using like he's using mobile
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:46.560]   mobile data because this guy been here so i don't want to like jack up your your your overages to
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:52.960]   about twenty to thirty dollars uh but uh but uh it's anything else have a have a question for uh
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:58.800]   for steven or is anything they'd like to know uh alex or kully uh what are you gonna get
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:05.760]   that what that was announced today what am i gonna get well yeah um i was
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:13.360]   choosing people inside that uh next thursday is my
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:25.680]   first day so um i'm definitely going to get an apple watch um i'm not sure about the iPhones yet
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:32.240]   i'm gonna hold out and see on that because i have an iPhone 10 and it's fine uh but
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:43.040]   we'll see but definitely an iPhone uh um apple watch yeah well we we we should let you go again
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.680]   so you stop burning money uh but we definitely want to thank you for picking all the trouble
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:53.440]   like you're literally fresh you're in the car right now you could not become call us any earlier
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:35:01.040]   let's definitely plug uh one of the one of my favorite podcasts out there the the accessible
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:07.040]   podcast uh that you do with timothy buck uh which people can find on accessible dot fm
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:15.600]   it's a bi-weekly podcast and you tell us about it you you sell it for us yeah um so uh i think
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:25.840]   accessible putting in tech is uh a uh underrepresented topic and uh i
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:36.000]   want to help kind of uh spread the word about how all this technology you know impacts uh
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:47.680]   disabled people and we do uh fortnight we show about accessible video tech which does
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:55.440]   cover apple largely but um we do talk about you know other companies as well
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:03.440]   well again thank you thank you so much for making this time and again invoice me and i'll see what
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:09.040]   i can do about getting you some of that overcharge of that uh steve makino thank you so much again i
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.840]   can't tell you how valuable uh europe your your thoughts were once again uh for the accessible
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:21.120]   podcast go to accessible dot fm uh thank you again steven this has been great thank you guys bye
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:32.000]   cheers so so what what about that like we didn't i was no no mention of the airpower charging mat
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   uh that was promoted as this can we call it late yet and because and because the airpower mat isn't
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.240]   available that would imply that they also didn't mention the new uh chi charger capable uh case
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:51.600]   for uh uh for the airpods uh kelly we is is this a bad sign or is this just a wop wop moment that we
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:58.720]   just move on from well for me i i would like to think that this is for more people than just me
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:06.400]   but um i have been holding off for the last month or two on getting airpods i didn't have any before
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:12.320]   i'm starting to see where um i could really use a pair and i went you know apple's got an event
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:20.000]   coming and they talked about the airpower already previously so obviously we're gonna get an update
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.120]   on that and part of that update is gonna be the new case and if they're gonna have a new case for
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.880]   original airpods maybe they're just gonna have new airpods so i should wait and they didn't say
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:36.000]   anything um something that i and that was the thing that i sort of noticed about this this
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.800]   particular event was the things that they didn't mention uh we heard a lot from people beforehand
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.440]   about how ipads were gonna be part of this event because they're also ios devices so that was the
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:52.800]   thing that i didn't see uh no airpower no airpods you know like once you get this shiny new phone
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.480]   like you don't want to have to hold it to your face so here's these fancy pants new headphones
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:06.000]   and you should have them for reasons um we didn't get any of that kind of stuff um and i i thought
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.960]   that we would see a little bit more of that kind of thing and the reason that i wonder about it is
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:17.040]   because we weren't even it wasn't even casually mentioned it wasn't acknowledged at all like this
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:24.480]   is a thing that if i recall we heard about the the mat at the last apple at the iphone 10 event
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:31.040]   yeah that that sounds like so it's been like a year and we've not seen hide nor hair of it from
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.440]   anybody anywhere at any minute now i expect somebody to have emailed to him at apple.com
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:43.760]   and get some reply about that maybe we could publish um because like it's it was very odd to me
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:51.120]   that they announced it without with the vagus of dates like it's totally coming we know that and
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:56.480]   that's all they said so that to me was sort of odd and then to not hear anything about it again
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:05.600]   is even more odd um i uh as far as the event goes on what we did see uh i am super duper excited
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:12.800]   about that watch i'm super excited i know a lot of people who are who are excited about it because
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:19.120]   this may be christmas shopping for their parents done and dusted um because that fall sensor like
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:26.720]   is amazing to me and the heart tracking information is super great let's let's go ahead and start
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:33.120]   talking about the apple watch series four uh and so well we so we saw the pictures we didn't know
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.720]   whether that the big that really super dense or display represented more pixels and denser
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:45.600]   pixels or different design so we find out that they've actually made the watch bigger and said it's
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:53.840]   a now uh 40 millimeters uh set of 42 and i think 38 now it's uh 40 uh didn't have that in front of
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:40:02.240]   me uh now it is 44 44 44 however they made the point that it's now thinner so it actually displaces
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:10.160]   less liquid if that so it's technically smaller than the previous generation uh hardware uh and
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:16.240]   and now so the and now the screen actually fills out more of the display and now actually has
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:23.120]   rounded corners in every corner so it's not a squared off display uh it's uh so it's uh we got
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:29.680]   a new gold tone color uh the big but the the biggest thing about it is the uh new new heart
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:37.200]   features about it uh now it has an actual uh easy g scanner uh so that it uses uh it will actually
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:44.880]   get like the the easy easy g waves from your heart uh by it creates a circuit with uh one contact is
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.880]   the uh is the back of the watch against your wrist the other one is when you press a finger against
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:57.040]   the against the digital crown that completes the circuit it will take about 30 seconds to look at
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.760]   your look at your heart rhythm and then either tell you okay you seem to be in regular sinus rhythm
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:09.040]   or say you might be in you i i have it written down somewhere but it's the most tactful way of
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:16.400]   saying yeah that wasn't normal not that you should get excited about this or any more excited but it
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.040]   will tell you that you i'm seeing things i am seeing things that are not inconsistent with
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:27.120]   atrial fibrillation uh and perhaps you might want to have to get this checked out uh and it's not
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.920]   really cool that you can do this on your own and this is the first as they said uh the first FDA
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:36.800]   approved device that is simply a consumer level device that you don't need a doctor's note in
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:43.040]   order to get it you can just buy it and get even if you have no reason to get an ekg you can get ekg's
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:49.120]   uh but not only that but it will save that ekg as a pdf so you can if you're having a if you're
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.880]   getting a check if you're having one of those moments where suddenly you feel a little bit
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.680]   dizzy or you feel like something's not quite right and you don't want to run to the emergency room
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:02.960]   for ten thousand dollars because you feel not quite right you can just get yourself an ekg
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.880]   and then remind yourself oh i got it check up in two months i'll just make sure my doctor sees
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.720]   this pdf file and then he will tell me whether to cancel all my appointments for the next three
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.080]   weeks and start shaving my chest for for a zipper job uh that's pretty that's pretty incredible that's
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.880]   dramatic that's not we're still thinking it's pretty cool to get your pulse rate off of one of these
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:26.880]   fitness watches uh but that kind of changes everything like did it did how did you react to that out
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.800]   do you want to get one of these things and do you think it'll help you not die in the next 10 years
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.600]   well i think that it actually i mentioned on the on the earlier shows by my father actually had a
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.960]   heart attack last year and he's fine now but he uh but it was a close call and i think there's an
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:47.280]   argument for me to get him i mean we're just mentioned i get him uh you know a watch for his
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.760]   now i've just given up fortunately he doesn't listen to the show so he's he's not so uh so he's like i
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.480]   know he's gonna get for his for christmas but but i think that you know that that could be a solid
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.200]   solution and i think that's a big market you know my father's generation uh growing into that market
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.600]   is a big market of folks that that need to start paying more attention to how their hearts
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.080]   moving i mean we all do to some degree but uh but i think that um that's gonna be an important
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.160]   market and i think it could literally the reason it's so important is that it could literally
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.640]   double the sales you know if you have a lot of doctors saying this is the this is what we approve
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:24.240]   and you had the you know you had the right people up there on stage talking about it uh that uh i
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.480]   think that a lot of doctors i could see going into this fall and going into the spring and going
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.200]   into the next cycle you know really the next phone cycle talking to their to their patients and
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.080]   saying this is really important and as we saw from the reports of when apple was talking to the FDA
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.640]   this is not a this is not a trivial problem this is not a simple problem to fix and it's and it's
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.760]   going to be difficult of course we know there's probably a hundred patents that are related to
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.680]   that one little process that apple did so it's not going to be something that someone's going to
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:55.760]   reproduce really really fast and so apple focusing on this market is is going is could yield huge
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.480]   benefits for the the proliferation of the watch into certain populations and so i think that it's
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.920]   going to be it's going to be very important it's probably the most important announcement
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.440]   of the of the day um as far as the you know proliferation of the rest of it is
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:14.320]   i think that you know the rest of the rest of the day was was really talking about you know
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.320]   incremental changes that are that are better and if you haven't bought last years you probably
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.920]   want to go ahead and buy you know this is probably a good time to upgrade that that type of thing
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:28.320]   but this is really moving moving the uh uh the whole thing forward of really creating this and
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:34.240]   there's just you know there's all kinds of opportunities when when you start talking about
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:38.640]   what it's doing is as far as how it's getting what you're doing and and paying attention to that and
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:44.720]   and processing it there's a lot of um a lot of opportunities there you know as far as and
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:51.200]   out there are some losers of course uh cardio cardiomobile made by a live core um probably not the most
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.640]   excited about this announcement yeah that's that that's that handheld device it's like a
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.440]   popsicle stick with like two metal pads that you grab with your thumbs you get doctors no
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.000]   four yeah and it's a great device i got one i got one you know i was experimenting with it for
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.600]   some other stuff and i and i have one and it's a great little device that is completely not useful
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.120]   now i mean you know it's you know i don't know if it's you know it's not the one you want back
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:18.800]   well here's the deal unless unless they can prove that they're significantly more and i mean
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.120]   significantly more accurate which is unlikely than than the watches um you know they're gonna
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:28.720]   have a hard time uh selling over that i mean i think that as a startup this is fairly devastating
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.440]   you know hit you know to to your product um because it's it's it's something that's easy
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:39.120]   still more expensive to buy the watch than what they have but but uh i think it's easier because
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.680]   now it's on your anytime you have that feeling and we have it we had a someone who used to work for
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.080]   us that that did have um some hard issues and he had to pay attention to that all the time
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.800]   and being able to have it on your wrist and being able to manage that is is very very important
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:57.040]   so i think that it's um it's it's a pretty big thing it's not something that i'm necessarily
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.120]   interested in um most of the time when it says that i'm having an issue it's i'm watching the
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:07.280]   stealer game or i'm on a stationary bike by the way so i get these alerts about once a week
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.960]   from my stationary all my stationary bike going your heart rate is very high but you're not you
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.480]   don't seem to be exercising i'm like what is this i'm doing here you know i know so
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:20.080]   now Alex said something that that i thought was really interesting with um you said Alex
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.720]   paying more attention to your health to like heart health specifically but but health in general
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.760]   and the thing that i think is the most interesting about this is that you don't have to pay attention
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   so if you're somebody like me who wears a watch every day anyways this is an apple watch um
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:43.520]   it's an og apple watch so i'm super excited about series four um so for for somebody like me who
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:48.240]   already wears a watch like whether it's it's somebody in in my demographic or my parents demographic
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:52.960]   or whoever if you already wear a watch every day and all you have to do is get up and put on a
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.200]   different watch like you already have the habit of putting one on each anyway so as long as you
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:02.240]   have that you don't have to pay attention so it's one of those things where like when you do go to
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:08.240]   the doctor for whatever reason uh you have all that information for them so like hey by the way
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.760]   there was this thing i wanted to ask you about because i have this list of information in my phone
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:17.600]   of these times that something happened or uh you know like i was feeling weird or you know i
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.920]   recorded like i have these incidents where i feel really dizzy and here's like what my heart rate
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:26.880]   looked like at that time and let me talk to you about it because i want to figure this out and
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.520]   the thing about it is that you didn't have to do anything in order to make that happen so that's
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.960]   the part to me that is the most exciting about this is that it's like the lowest amount of effort
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:43.280]   like all you have to do is wear a watch and then you have access to all of this happening automatically
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:48.320]   and to me that's the part that's really great and that's also the part that's really great uh if you
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:54.160]   have a parent or some other family member a parent a grandparent whoever that may be and maybe you
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.880]   already have a system where they have your previous generation iPhone you know so they have a phone
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.760]   that can connect to a watch effectively and you know so they've already got half the technology
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.920]   that they need and then for Christmas you get them one of these watches and now you know like if they
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:14.160]   fall their watch is automatically going to call somebody maybe that's you maybe it's not but
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.680]   somebody's gonna find out if they fall and if it turns out that they're in a position not to be
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.800]   able to call for help themselves then that call gets made automatically and like that for a lot
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.440]   of people i think is going to be super important just for peace of mind but also again you don't
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.560]   have to do anything to get that technology for that person like you have a watch you just need to
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:40.000]   wear your watch now let me show you like how to set a timer let me show you how to you know put
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   your calendar on the bottom of it or um you know like i sort of hope almost that they still kept
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.160]   some of the simpler watch faces for people who don't want all of that stuff like i look at that
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:55.760]   that version four that series four watch face and i'm like that's still not enough information on
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:02.640]   my arm like for me now for my mom like you want you want like a wonder woman like gauntlet with
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:08.880]   like an iphone xs basically embedded into it with 3d printing just make a watch strap i'm sure
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:14.400]   Renee already has one make a watch strap that slides into a special modified case so i can just
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.880]   buckle the iphone 10 straight to my arm and then then maybe i will have enough information on my
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:24.320]   arm but until then um like i look at that and that seems like a good amount of information on a
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:30.640]   watch for me because of who i am but like my mom would probably want you know the time in big digital
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.040]   letters and then like a button to call me and a button to call my brother and a button to call
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:39.920]   her sister and like you know and and maybe that's that's one of the cool things go ahead
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:46.480]   i'm sorry i'm not even customizable faces i hope they're simpler but i think that um overall like the
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:52.960]   the barrier of entry for this is so low and it gives you access to so much by just wearing your
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:58.320]   watch every day having that heart rate of availability like with historical data like here's the last
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.240]   six months since i saw you last time doc here's what i've got you know that sort of stuff like
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.640]   automatically i think is gonna be amazing well and i and i think that when we think about so they
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.840]   didn't talk to specifically but i think that uh what will probably end up seeing within the next
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:18.000]   year is the idea they said that it can it can see an afib event right and now i can do an ecg or an
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   ekg they're both the same thing um and uh the and so it can do that and they can also send it to your
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.640]   doctor now if you tie all those things together and consider it buffering that data you could have
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:34.560]   the watch actually see that you're having it thinks that you're having some kind of event it goes ahead
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:39.760]   and runs the cycle to measure that event and then it and then it basically brings it up and says hey
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:45.920]   i think you have something i've recorded the last you know minute or whatever of your and it shows
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.520]   something that is important do you want me to send this to your doctor right now and that could be
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:54.400]   life changing literally life-changing life-saving for young people where they send it immediately
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.920]   hit it and a minute later you get a call on your watch that says hey this is the hospital we're
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.640]   sending someone over you need to get you need to come in right now this is this is what's so
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   exciting about these these health features that so much of it just it's not just uh it's not like
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:13.120]   the first generation where if you want your pulse rate you have to tap through the absurd
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:18.560]   series zero watch watch it with interface to get to that thing and then get a pulse rate it is
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.880]   always checking your pulse and it's saying it's giving you a notification that okay your heart rate
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:28.400]   is kind of really low i just want to give you a notification about that and also again taking these
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:35.920]   these ECGs on a regular basis uh and but and it's not and giving you sort of a heads up that
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.840]   there's something you might want to take a look at or this is not normal for you and the other
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:45.760]   thing that's this is i hope this doesn't sound too ghoulish but the the value of this data when you
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:52.560]   have hundreds of thousands of people that are getting just day-to-day samples of what is normal
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:59.680]   for them uh we're going to have a valuable cache of research information where we have when people
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:05.920]   drop dead of a heart attack they don't they're usually not strapped up to an ekg machine and they're
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:12.560]   near they're usually not as strapped up to a bunch of patchy sensors glued to their chest but in
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:18.160]   addition to helping people who are having events survive those events it can collect information
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:24.400]   it's i i wonder if there is a or going to be a like a black box mode to it where there's
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.040]   other you know when this when this when this person dies here is the data that was collected
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:33.600]   up until the moment that his heart stopped and here is everything that was happening when we started
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:38.000]   noticing that this was an event this was an event that was happening and will that be available to
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   researchers i think i think that one of the things that's interesting there is that is that the
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:48.080]   uh that is why apples conversation about privacy and their conversation about the
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:53.280]   anonymous anonymization of the data so they really talked a lot about how the fact that they're
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.000]   gonna they basically encrypt the data they disconnect all the personal information and then send it
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.920]   out if you're part of a study like that so if you have people that are in risk high risk factors
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.720]   and of course they're not going to talk about that the first time they talk about an ekg you
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.680]   know they're not we're releasing an akg it's great they're not going to talk about the fact that if
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.000]   you die we're going to send you all the data you know but i could definitely see six months a year
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.800]   a year and a half they kind of you know it's like kind of like sneaking up on a horse you got to
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:22.720]   move like you're not moving so anyway the uh but i think that they have to they i think that where
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.960]   they're going is definitely what you're talking about which is that there is so much data about
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.680]   issues around those that we're going to be able to see and be able to actually give people more
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.080]   warning further ahead of time that might save their life because of the data that we're getting
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.400]   from that but that requires everybody to trust you that your that the data is not going to be
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:45.520]   connected to them where it affects their insurance it affects you know all their job job growth it
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:48.880]   affects all kinds of things but but explaining that i think is really important i also think
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.960]   it's important that apple is focusing on a very different market when we think about focusing you
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:57.760]   know their main competitor i would say is really fitbit right and fitbit is really pointed towards a
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:05.520]   a fit first population and the i-bone the i-watch the the apple watch is is you know if you're fit
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:10.800]   it's it's important to you as well but it's also really inclusive of this less than fit you know
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:16.160]   population that that may need some of the more uh important pieces of that of that puzzle and
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:21.040]   that that market at least in the united states is much larger than the fit market yeah yeah they
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.000]   did make a big point of saying about how data is encrypted on the device itself and it falls under
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.680]   apple's larger privacy guidelines so again if the insurance company did want to offer apple
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.240]   a bushel of money if and if they are taken over by jerks who want to sell it they wouldn't have
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:41.360]   the they wouldn't even have the ability to do that uh but there's so there's just so much cool stuff
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:46.720]   here uh let's i'm just going to go through just a couple of details before we get to the big question
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.560]   they're kind of worried about now but for you do that andi i want to put forth a theory i have a
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:57.920]   crazy theory um and right now that theory is for the apple watch uh what they're doing is uh with
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.480]   with the ekg information in the heart data that's just reporting like that doesn't influence
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.040]   anything that you're doing it doesn't it doesn't change if you have some sort of condition
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:12.160]   like the apple watch isn't changing that it's just reporting on it and apple went through the fda
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:18.960]   and my theory is that part of where this started or part of the reason that they started with the
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:24.000]   heart stuff and not the first thing i assumed that they would go with is you know something for uh
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.880]   blood sugar monitoring is because this doesn't change anything it's just reporting it's not
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:33.760]   intrusive and so part of the reason they went through this for fda approval and to make sure that
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.920]   it was you know sort of legit as far as like a medical device that is measuring your heart rate
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:43.520]   and that sort of thing is to have gone through the fda exercise so that they can get into something
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.760]   that i guess technically would be intrusive you know if you're talking about like i need to have
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:52.800]   more insulin or you know if i if i need shots for something like because i'm diabetic um
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:58.800]   getting more into that market so my hope is that that's where this this is the first step down that
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:05.200]   road where um blood sugar monitoring can be a thing that happens in some fashion or um you know
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.960]   you can get an alert like your blood sugar is really low right now you know you you might want
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.520]   to look into that so that's my hope and that that's uh a theory i'm putting out there now i'm
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:19.760]   i'm sticking a flag in it yeah i'm i'm sure i'm sure that wasn't just the technology that the fda
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:24.640]   ran a fine tooth comb through it was simply the nature of the notifications that provides the
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.040]   user that i can't say you seem to be having a heart attack right now it can only state the
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:35.200]   facts that my sensors indicate that your pulse rate is lower than it was before that is a fact
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.920]   and not a medical opinion and by the point and collected information so that someone who actually
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:45.200]   has uh the brain and the eyes and the ears can translate that into something uh more interesting
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:51.280]   uh the so uh they uh they're promising that the you get the same 18 hour all day battery life
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:57.840]   you can have a six hour outdoor workout uh the if with the GPS on all that time uh i thought it
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:03.600]   was nice that it's now got bluetooth five uh which is the same bluetooth radio that the iPhone 10
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:10.560]   has had uh which means that uh lot faster many times a distance you can connect more devices to it
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:18.480]   at once or in a maintain a log for it that's and so a lot less power uh starts at 399 bucks or
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   499 bucks with cellular uh and they're keeping the series three on the price list at 279
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:30.480]   thus making it uh pretty uh pretty price comparative but there's now here's the here's the big question
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:37.520]   i've asked it before and now i'm asking it even more urgently at this point is it almost unethical
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:44.000]   for apple to say you have to own an iPhone or else you don't get any of the benefits of this watch
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.160]   we're not even we're not going to let you pair it with a uh with a with a macbook we're not going
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:53.040]   to let you pay pair it with an iPad uh even though it works just great when you don't on your wrist
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:58.160]   just simply as a data collection tool as a time uh keeping thing and something that can communicate
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.800]   with with your home wifi and maybe give you those alerts and give you those emergency uh
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:09.920]   uh emergency contacts as you go uh i really wish that apple would explain why you need to own an
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:14.960]   iPhone the other than well conceptually we wanted to partner with an iPhone because that's you'll
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:20.400]   have the iPhone in your pocket and the and the watch on your wrist but as as listeners are
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:26.480]   disgusted with uh with uh meir repeating i am an android user but i'm also an apple watch user and
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:33.600]   the because it's my favorite fitness watch it's really really cool apple even said that this is the
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:39.360]   best-selling watch of any kind of watch out there not just fitness watch it is a cool cool watch
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:43.760]   and the great thing is when you don't have it like paired uh when you don't have it tethered to
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:49.520]   your phone at all times i keep it in airplane mode and i get days and days and days worth a battery
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:54.320]   life out of it meanwhile it's still like giving me my rings it's still telling me the time and
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:00.880]   giving me basic features i at some point don't we have to ask apple if these if this is has such
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:08.320]   great potential to improve people's lives extend people's lives aren't you sort of obligated to at
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:13.520]   least open it up so that people who don't maybe have an iowice device but not necessarily a phone
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:20.720]   can use it or even people who have just simply a wifi signal inside their house and that'll be
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.920]   good enough for the user to be able to download software updates install apps communicate with
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:32.080]   the outside world it's it saddens me that they're not even they're not doing the same thing with
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:36.800]   the apple watch they did with the ipad and the iphone and the ipod which is to say that we're
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:43.120]   making this device for everybody not necessarily as a way to get people more locked into the apple
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:48.960]   ecosystem am i am i being a curmudgeon here or i can be a curmudgeon and have a point but which
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.680]   what do you think else i think that they i think that they they had the same pattern in earlier
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.640]   ones as well as when we first got our iphone you had to plug it in you had to do all this
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.560]   stuff and we were like why can't we just untethered the iphone and you know just let it update
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:06.240]   eventually they got to the point where you could do that and by the way if you don't as i have
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:13.200]   found if your kids um uh forget all their passcodes it is really you really wish you had synced to
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:19.520]   the computer i'm just just saying so anyway so uh but but i think that uh you know i i think that
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:25.280]   has less to do with any kind of business end of things and more to do with the user experience of
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.040]   you know people having a good experience with the phone they'd rather i mean with the watch
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:33.040]   is that the easiest way to update it the easiest way to make it useful from apples perspective is
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.520]   probably but i think it's but i'm saying it's yeah but i'm just saying i think that you know what
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.760]   what they what they want is that you the people who got the watch have the highest value of that
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.200]   that have it have it they're not as worried that they have a lot of people who have the phone and
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.520]   so i think that there's less worried about people who don't have the phone i you know i i will say
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:01:00.320]   that while you like it i bet you that you know i i i generally view apples view of product development
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.040]   just from the outside as what will 90 percent of the people want to do 90 percent of the time
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.720]   if you're in the 10 percent we're doing something that only 10 that you want to do 10 percent of the
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:14.000]   time apple's probably not for you that's why it's why a lot of power android users are power
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.320]   android users because they want to do things that live in that 10 10 you know range and i think that
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.800]   apple really focuses on it i bet you there's less than 10 percent of the people who have watches
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:29.360]   apple watches have um something other than an iphone i'm can i can i can i can i can i can i'm just
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.120]   this is something that i this is just something that i feel this is not a thing where the
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:40.400]   that 90 10 90 10 thing which makes sense in so many ways i don't think it really applies here
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:48.640]   because now i'm i got as as my as my general practitioner every time that my my gpu i get my
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:55.200]   physical from every year every two years was also my dad's gp and so usually like when we talk about
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:02.160]   like long term health care he uses the phrase well your genes absolutely suck because he knows
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.560]   he knows my dad's history and my grandparents history and heart is you know heart attacks
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:13.440]   getting people by in their mid 50s is part of that wonderful mix that we call the anatko gene
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:21.440]   gene assortment uh and this is this i'm i had actually sort of set aside some money to like
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:27.520]   upgrade my two or three year old like moto 360 uh android wear smartwatch which i love
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.840]   and i'm really excited about the next generation of hardware that uh was kind of semi-revealed a
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:38.000]   couple days ago but i really was as as easily tempted before to get to replace it with a new
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.040]   version of the apple watch and with the apple watch series four i'm even more tempted because
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:49.840]   again there are times where i you know it's i it's not like the i not like i smell toast and there's
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.920]   i lose my color vision for three seconds and it comes back on again i'm talking about i just
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.800]   felt a little bit dizzy for just about a second and i don't know whether it's because you know i
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:04.480]   got up too fast or something like that it would be kind of cool to know to basically if there's
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:11.360]   to have this little watch this this little thing watching over me not for my entire like heart health
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:16.400]   but at least looking after a certain part of it and at least collecting data that can be used to
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.520]   avoid my getting the zipper in the middle of my chest and this is why i really would like to
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:27.920]   i really would like apple to find a way to accommodate people uh who don't necessarily have an iphone
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.360]   who i i have an out i have an older iphone that i keep synced to my existing apple watch for the
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.760]   purpose of keeping it up to date and making sure the time is synced when the battery goes all the
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:43.440]   way down to down to flat uh but i just i think that's an artificial thing that they're putting in there
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.120]   and if they really do think that this is such a brilliant device that will help people's health
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.920]   i think that it's worth their investment to extend it to people who are outside the ecosystem
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.360]   i have blather on blather on blather on kelly too what do you have to say
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:02.640]   well the most generous the most generous explanation i can come up with for it is that
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.080]   uh they are saving people from having to spend any more time in iTunes than absolutely necessary
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.480]   because remember my fondest wish from any apple event is that tim cook comes out on stage with
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:19.680]   a big sack of paper and says this is the itunes source code and he turns to his left and feeds
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:26.080]   it to a wood chipper this is my fondest wish it is a actually this is my fondest wish a close
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.400]   second is that at ten minutes to the hour everyone in the audience stands up and swings their arms
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.880]   for a second because they've got a move ring that has alerted them but anyway that's what's at
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:42.080]   the point um i think i i i agree with with uh part of what was what Alex was saying which is that
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:48.960]   i think they're going to get there i think uh part of it is that the watch is new and it's harder
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:56.400]   to make itself contained for over the air updates i think uh the advent of the of cellular to the
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.920]   watch is part of what is going to make that possible uh you know just like over the air updates on
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:07.680]   your iphone were a thing that we didn't get for a really really long time and i think it's just a
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:13.520]   matter of the evolution of that and secretly i'm sort of glad that they're not doing that um
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.160]   for another crazy theory that i would like to put out there because i thought about this before
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.640]   when i was having um an issue updating my apple watches why can't i just plug it into itunes why
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:30.560]   do i want to plug it into itunes well i don't but um maybe part of like down the line uh we're going
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   to get what i've thought we've had we've needed for a long time which is a separate store application
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:42.240]   on macos and a separate backup application on macos like something that sort of uh works hand
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.760]   in hand with like image capture like when you plug in your phone and image capture pops up so
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.160]   that you can take all the pictures off your phone um that we also get a backup utility that works a
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:54.320]   lot like the image capture stuff does and that maybe you will get one for the watch and then you
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:59.120]   download the watch utility if you need it you know um it's part of macos it would be free in the app
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.960]   store if it's a thing that you need if you don't need don't worry about it uh just like you do on
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:10.960]   the phone now and so my hope is that um at some point when they do break itunes apart and build
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:17.200]   it all up again for the future that uh that's uh that that's a part of what happens so that the
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.240]   watch can be a little bit more autonomous um and if they use whatever that technology is that they're
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:27.360]   using then it would also work for people who are windows users you know or uh people like you who
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.600]   are android users and so it takes the phone out of the equation a little bit i think they need to
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:37.520]   figure out the rest of what it's going to take for the watch to be a self-contained unit by itself
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:43.360]   uh without having to you know beam the health information back to the phone or you know whatever
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.840]   that kind of stuff is being able to manage that internally and then be able to shuffle that off
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:55.440]   to another device whether it's a computer or a phone maybe you'll get an option um to figure out
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.120]   how to do that effectively so that that's information like if you needed to restore a backup that
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.080]   that's a thing that could happen for you yeah the apple the uh we we we have to move on uh but
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:09.600]   i'll just i'll just say that the the the uh the apple that i've created in my mind which may or
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.960]   may not have any intersections uh with the actual apple what's wouldn't wouldn't just say well look
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:19.760]   we're we're selling the number one most popular watch of any kind in the world you really can't
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:26.080]   improve upon that why why wouldn't it be better for us to put our resources into making adding
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:32.640]   more health features to the watch rather than just simply allow uh redoing it so that the software
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.600]   will work with android or the software will work on ios or something like that i just hope that it
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.240]   occurs to them that they've got something that is more more valuable than a that a gadget watch or
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.120]   a fashion watch which is what they showed with the series zero this really the series four really
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:53.280]   is the culmination of a lot of really great positive thinking i've it's been a marvelous to watch this
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:58.480]   this product evolve uh we're gonna go back to uh leo la port probably on a barge probably being
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:05.120]   fed grapes one by one uh by somebody uh with our with our next message uh let me interrupt you guys

[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:23.680]   thank you leo and i have to admit that i've been on the go since literally 10 seconds after waking
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:29.840]   up this morning and i didn't brush my teeth this morning perhaps if i had a pocket size quip tooth
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:36.240]   brush that would allow me to brush on the go i would not be the filthy semi-adult that whose
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:42.400]   stinky breath appears before you right now and right today okay let's let's go let's go on to uh the
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:50.080]   new iphone 10s uh i wouldn't say that it was a remarkable update they had so they took the
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:56.080]   here's in broad strokes here's what happened they took the iphone 10 of last year and they did two
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:02.960]   things to it they gave it the nominal incremental upgrade that we often see in an off year uh with
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:08.640]   matching the same prices and keeping the same like sort of prestigious surgical stainless steel
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.480]   as was said during the during the keynote and the wonderful OLED display screen to screen
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:22.960]   and upgraded the processor and all the sort of stuff and that was that was nice it's also they
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:32.240]   also added a new addition to the 5.8 inch screen display that has on the on the regular iphone xs
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:41.520]   x pause s so we don't say excess uh 5.8 inch i think that they two point i think they go ahead one
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:50.240]   they want you to say 10s yeah i see i see apples and let's have a sidebar here i think apple has
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:56.080]   lost its product naming mojo i mean i i think we're all old enough to remember the day when uh
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:05.920]   someone uh it was uh it was possible to buy a mac macintosh centrist xl 747 they began you have
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:12.880]   these that's different from the 745 because the 747 was a label exactly for uh the seers stores
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:18.640]   and the 746 is the one that was available at office max and so now we're dealing with we got the
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:25.120]   xs which is the super expensive that's how i'm remembering it is the xs super expensive
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:35.040]   that's the 999 dollar phone they have added the 6.5 inch xs max that does not roll off the tongue
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.600]   i will tell you that uh and now the top price uh the addition one of the main many features and a
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:48.160]   very long and technical uh rollout of this device during the keynote of the new uh of the new a12
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:54.640]   a bionic processor is that now this can address a whopping 512 gigabytes of storage so if you want
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.800]   to get the most of the largest amount of money if you're really just there to make sure that by
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:04.160]   the end of the year you've spent as much of your expense expense account as you possibly can before
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:16.480]   it rolls over uh you can buy a 512 gigabyte iphone xs max for 1,449 dollars if you're gonna cheap out
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:28.000]   the xr uh the the smaller version will max out at 1,299 dollars but so you've got the xs the xs max
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:36.480]   underneath that is the uh so quote-unquote budget version of this the xr uh which they
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:42.160]   cut a few corners instead of getting uh stainless steel you get aluminum instead of getting a an
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:48.720]   OLED screen you get a led display but this is apple so they have to tell you it is a liquid retina
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:54.960]   display one of the most amazing led displays ever shipped uh they'll be shipping a month later
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:03.040]   and that one is going to be less expensive to the tune of starting at i believe 799 dollars
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:09.840]   am i uh we're both of you a little bit confused and are there little birdies just sort of
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.160]   tweeting in circles cartoon-like around your head trying to keep all of these things straight
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:20.480]   and their features mostly i'm confused why you keep calling it an iphone x it's a 10 because
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:26.240]   because it's the letter it's the letter x okay it's the letter x if they wanted to call the iphone
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:33.680]   10 see that the was the iphone not was the iphone 8 called the iphone like v i i it was not it was
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.320]   called the iphone 8 no it was not so you don't call it the iphone v i i you call it an iphone 8 this
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.160]   is the they would they would have known if they if they wanted to be if they wanted to be the iphone
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.960]   10 they would have had a one and a zero they put an x so they wanted me to call it the iphone x
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:55.120]   and also x is cooler the best starboard movie is not episode v andi patrick's stewart patrick's
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:03.120]   stewart does not play professor 10 he plays professor what x i rest my case okay and what operating
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.920]   system does your computer run because it's not o s x sweetie i i love you andi but you're calling
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.920]   it an x and it's killing me well i think that that i think that that's the o s 10 is where this all
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.800]   came from because we all knew that it was it was telling us that we were moving to unix and so it was
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:22.320]   like o s so to us it was like o s x because it's like linux it's like unix it's like as all of us
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.040]   just kept on saying o s x you know i'm not all of us but many of us did and it just seems silly to
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.200]   call it o s 10 i think that we've just never really gotten out of that habit of like when we see that
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.320]   i know that they say 10 but we're going to just keep saying x so but we we we have a
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:41.120]   okay and part of the reason that it bugs me is because like it never got broken from the the
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:47.520]   the o s 10 stuff you know back the day um you know it's 10 14 now and we still call it
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.400]   oh you know it it people like they're they're getting away from that by referring to everything
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:58.240]   by the code name so that they don't have to worry about is it o s x or s 10 um so the thing that i
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.240]   don't like about it is that all of a sudden we've got all these weird naming conventions that we
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:09.920]   didn't have before and i i don't mind that i don't mind that they want to come up with their own
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:16.080]   naming conventions but don't spend 10 years giving me naming conventions and then burn them all down
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:20.640]   that's the part that i'm sort of frustrated about like the last time we got an iphone that came
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:27.760]   in colors it ended in c it was the same phone but color but but the backs were colored so
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:33.520]   if you bought one that was a different color it was the five c instead of the five all the other
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:39.440]   stuff was the same it's a minimal like device it's a handy minimal like device right that too
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:44.160]   so that so i was like oh so this is the 10 c no it's an r we're not going to tell you why we
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.840]   called it r because remember the s always used to stand for different stuff on the other phones
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:54.800]   like the s was for speed and the s was for syria and the s was for other things um you know they
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.120]   always said like this one is the s model because it's it's got this other thing and this time they're
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:04.160]   like it's r and we're not going to tell you why like it's just an r now and we're going to call the
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:07.760]   other one ten s and we're not going to have a ten s plus we've conditioned you for years that the
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.560]   big phone is the plus but no more like now we're going to call it max but next year like are they
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:18.080]   gonna have an iphone five or does everything start with an x now like all of the rest of them are
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.720]   going to be ten models from here forward and we're never going to get an iphone nine like i mean
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:26.320]   we never technically we never really got an eight because it's actually the seven s even though they
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.680]   put it out of its misery today the thing overall the thing about it that i don't like is that on top
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:38.400]   of the naming convention being super confusing now additionally we have um the fact that they're
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.240]   selling seven different models because they're still selling the seven and the eight and the seven
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:51.680]   plus and the eight plus and now they've added uh the ten c and the new ten s and then the ten s plus
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:56.160]   even though that's not what they're calling them so that takes us to seven models of iphone so like
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:02.400]   when you walk in it's gonna be you know the dozen android phones down one side and the dozen iphones
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:07.760]   down the other side and like that but i think that's but i think that's that's part of uh i i
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.640]   actually think that that that is a part of what apple has to do is because they are one company
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.960]   serving is the same thing with max where you have to kind of cover the gamut is those androids a lot
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.880]   of them are by different manufacturers with different form factors now samsung does a lot of
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.680]   different form factors as far as you know how that goes and so so providing those is kind of giving
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:31.040]   that with a community that doesn't have other choices um the theoretical choices that they
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:35.600]   that they want i think apple has to you know manage the fact that there are some people that are
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.120]   gonna want an iphone that aren't gonna want to spend seven hundred and fifty dollars on one
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:44.560]   um with the fact that that's all they really want you to buy seven feet up you know like they like
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:49.120]   that's the you know the they're being nice with the other ones and those are very solid phones i still
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:55.440]   use a seven you know as my other my international phone and it's a great phone so so i think that
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:02.960]   that you know the price that price dropping down the the the new r is 95 percent the quality of or
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:07.760]   maybe 90 percent the quality of of last year's uh top of the line model for two hundred dollars less
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:13.520]   well not not just that it is i would have i if i were in the market for a new phone it would be
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:21.120]   really hard for me to decide between uh the iphone 10r and the iphone 10s uh because
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.280]   the the the main differences the most obvious differences are that okay you get a aluminum
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:30.080]   instead of stainless steel that doesn't affect the use of the phone make effectorability but i don't
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:34.320]   i don't sit down with the with the phone in my back pocket you get an led screen instead of a OLED
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:39.680]   screen OLED is nice deeper and crisper but it's not necessary but they did a really good job with it
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:43.280]   you still get edge edge display you still get those rounded corners you'll get pretty much
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.240]   the same experience and if you're upgrading from if you're not upgrading from an iphone 10 you
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:54.720]   are your previous iphone was an led display anyway and instead of having uh two uh camera a
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.240]   a telephoto in a wide-angle lens as your main shooter you only have the wide-angle lens but
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:07.280]   you're getting the same uh 12 uh you're getting the same uh processor as in the super expensive phone
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:11.680]   you're getting this it's only it's only the one wide-angle camera but you're getting the exact
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:16.880]   same camera uh they showed off really wonderful features for changing the apparent focal length
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:22.400]   they can either even fake the the effect of having those two stereo lenses to compare from so any
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.920]   picture ostensibly and until i'm informed otherwise the impression is that if you take a picture with
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:32.320]   these two cameras uh at for the same place at the same time they will look pretty much identical
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.520]   they went to lots of detail about things that they improved and uh like how HDR works and they
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.560]   made the point that they both work the same way uh they you get the uh they made the same
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:47.920]   improvements to uh the front-facing cameras so you get the exact same face ID you get the same
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:53.760]   true-death camera you get the same sort of effects you can get uh with selfies and with the and so
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:22:00.880]   with the uh with the uh less expensive phone not only do you get what will seem to be the same
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:05.840]   experience if you're willing to wait a month to be the first one to get it but you will also get a
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:11.440]   choice of you can get a yellow one you can get a yellow iPhone without having to go to some sort
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:16.320]   of market in china and have someone replace the back for you you can get a blue one you can get
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:24.000]   all these cool i i really gonna have to try both of them to see at what point do what separates this
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:32.080]   from a practical functional upgrade versus just i want the styling of that stainless steel i want
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:37.520]   that crisper OLED display because it looks like functionally these are going to be almost identical
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:43.920]   experiences yeah i do think that you're in pain yeah i think that the the difference between these
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:48.240]   is probably the closest difference between their higher end phone and their lower end phone they've
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.000]   ever had uh you know where they're you know they're you know they're really they i think they found
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.840]   something surgically found the places that cost them the most money remove those so the the camera
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.720]   and the and the and the screen are the two places that they made the biggest cuts those aren't
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:07.360]   operational cuts for many people um you know most people won't notice uh the difference
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:12.880]   between that i do think you'll see a difference in the portrait mode uh while they showed the
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.920]   portrait mode uh working just fine uh you'll notice that a lot of them were pretty smooth edges
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:23.440]   around the head yeah either generated or they gave them caps uh they gave them lots of things that
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:27.520]   made that work so i think that most likely what we're going to do is see what looked like the
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:33.920]   first generation of portrait mode which was pretty harsh on on curly hair um whereas i think that the
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:41.200]   two lenses uh the the um the yeah the my daughter has very curly hair and so the first round of of
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.760]   the portrait mode i was like well this doesn't work and uh and so it and it's gotten progressively
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:53.440]   better but uh the uh but i think that that's going to be the the places that um uh that that we're
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.840]   going to see you know that some of the differences so for people who really want the absolute best
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.920]   and for people who really have to have that outer edge of of what they're getting they're
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:06.560]   probably not upgrading from last year i don't think that unless you have a hard condition i don't see
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:12.240]   any vibe any real reason to upgrade if you got the last watch and the last phone but there's a super
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.840]   uh you know there's a bubble you know a super cycle of people who have not gotten any of those things
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:21.680]   so there's a huge opportunity for apple to do very very well um with these i think these are
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:27.280]   solid you know the rumors were that that the iphone got pushed the iphone of this year got pushed into
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:32.400]   last year which is one of the reasons we're seeing so little change this year because a lot of you
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:38.800]   know that was supposed to be uh it was kind of an almost an extra um from for for last year and i'm
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:43.360]   not sure exactly what the thought process was there but the um but that's the rumor and so that's
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:48.160]   part of why we're not seeing we're only seeing incremental uh increases uh this year but i think
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:54.000]   that i think that it's a you know if you haven't bought a phone uh in a year um it's probably a good
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   time you're gonna get you know that you have got some great options whether it's the r or the s
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.320]   i think you've got um some great options in front of you um i do think it will put more pressure on
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.480]   people to get it because because you have a seven hundred dollar one with the with the uh the front
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:12.960]   facing uh you know the face id you know there's gonna be a lot of your friends using mimojis and
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.600]   you're gonna be left out on the cold and you know when i send my you know i send my i send my wife
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.120]   mimojis you know calevin using the beta and then she can't send the back and i'm like yeah it's
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:26.880]   because you have a older phone i'm sorry you can't you can't play you know and so it's it's not it's
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:31.840]   not as bad as when you have to talk to someone with the green with green text but sorry Andy but you
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:37.120]   know i uh but it's it's it's close you know like you're just always like every time you get green
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:40.560]   text you're like ah this is gonna be hard it's only gonna go to this phone and i'm not gonna be
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:46.160]   able to oh oh no handies phone supports international standards for messaging instead of having an
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:52.880]   arbitrary locked in one that can only actually this is so much easier i'm taking away valuable
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:59.440]   time from kelly well okay so if i extend if i extend what Alex is saying which is you know that we got
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.600]   like a we got a phone last year that was supposed to be this year's phone like if they would
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:10.080]   knew they were gonna do the 10 last year why bother with the eight which you know because i it would
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:15.120]   have been too much the 10 would have been the 10 by itself would have been uh you know people it
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.440]   would have been a huge jump in price it would have been it also a lot of huge jumps there i think that
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.920]   that uh and they probably already had built the eight you know the eight was probably in mass production
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.480]   you know it's so so i think that that was probably the reason that for whatever business reason they
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.280]   made to move it up when we talk about how the outsides are always the same you know through like
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.080]   three generations of phone like the five and the five s and the six the six that like the reason
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:43.680]   like the reason all of the the square phones were the same was because like they'd already built
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.280]   all of the mechanisms for that so we can you know we don't have to do any research like we can just
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.400]   sort of put stuff in that sort of outside for free um the thing it's not it's not just that it's not
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:58.080]   just for apple one of the things that that's great about keeping the phone uh structure the same
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:04.000]   is is also for all the manufacturer of making cases i mean it's a huge deal like there's because
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.920]   you get an android you have no idea what kind of you know like oh i got to get this case and there's
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:13.200]   only three cases for this form factor whereas with an iphone there's generally because there's so
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:20.400]   few different choices there's there's a lot of cases that you can that you can get yeah so part of
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:25.760]   the reason that i'm that i'm as aggravated as i am about the name being all different and weird is
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:31.280]   because it is two full number one i'm a person who has to explain this to other people so um as
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:35.200]   soon as we're done here i'm gonna start getting phone calls from people like asking me to explain
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:41.920]   to them what happened this morning in english and the and so when somebody goes into a store and doesn't
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:48.000]   have a solid understanding of what all the differences are or a person who can explain to them like the
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.920]   one that you really need is this and not so much that one or whatever um it's going to be confusing
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.560]   for that person who maybe doesn't pay as much attention and you know they got the little text
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.560]   message like you can come upgrade your phone now so they go in and now they have all these choices
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.640]   and they don't know what the difference is and they don't know what parts they care about so you know
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:11.360]   last year when my mother-in-law upgraded for example um i sent her to an eight plus because
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:15.520]   i'm like this is like for the money that you want to spend this is the best camera you can get
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:20.720]   yep in your budget this is the better camera you don't want my phone which is just the eight
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:25.280]   you want a plus because you want the better camera because you're going on a big trip and you want
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:29.280]   to be able to take great pictures and if you want to ever be able to you know print one of those
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:33.680]   out nicely and have it hang up on the wall or whatever you want to do then uh you want to have
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:37.520]   the best camera you can get because this is going to be your camera like this is the camera you
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:42.560]   carry around if you get the get the the plus phone you know and then you know as a footnote she's
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.760]   super excited about it because her texts are a readable font size now you know because she
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:53.200]   doesn't have a smaller phone so like for regular folks who just walk in you know i'm gonna i'm
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.920]   gonna say unsupervised and like don't really know what's going on they know that the s is the nicer
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.280]   phone and they know that the plus is the bigger phone and neither of those is true anymore and
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.920]   that's the part that i feel like is just going to be frustrating for consumers who are just gonna
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.960]   go why should i spend eight hundred dollars like i don't even know what i'm getting i can go over
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.600]   here and get an android phone for five hundred dollars yeah and be happy with it and whatever and
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:21.200]   like i feel like that's not the best move for apple yeah i'm certainly not gonna i i want to i want
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.880]   to add add a note that i don't want to extend sour grapes the the other way of of expushing
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:32.160]   the exact same confusion i said is that apple did not did not decide to charge you more for an
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:37.520]   iPhone 10 like device of that has the most modern processor that has their best camera in it so
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:42.320]   i'm glad that they're while they're keeping the price relatively in the same range uh it starts at
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:49.840]   749 which they said was less expensive than an iPhone 8 plus which is a credible which is a credible
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.200]   thing for them to say because they're making the point that actually has even though it's a little
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:58.720]   bit smaller than an iPhone 8 plus it actually has the same size screen so that's pretty good but
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:02.720]   one other thing that i what we're talking about cameras that i really wanted to call out for them
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:07.440]   that was i really i noticed and i'm really really pleased with almost all of their demo pictures
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:13.520]   were pictures of people including portraits of people and they pointedly showed off a very very
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:20.240]   wide range of skin tones from not just i think the only i think the only skin tone that was not
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:27.360]   represented on the entire world skin tone spectrum was like the kono noprian style level of like
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:33.600]   pasty bluish green white other than that that you you rarely really see for instance uh people
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:39.120]   with very very very very dark skin represented and that's such an important thing for them to show
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:44.240]   off because so many cameras whether you it's in your phone or whether something you're spending
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:49.760]   $2,000 for so many of them they were created by engineers that were that programmed them to
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:55.600]   treat like Caucasian skin as normal and so when you throw very very dark skin at that sensor
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:00.240]   at that image processor it doesn't know how to handle it properly and every single picture no
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:06.240]   matter from what part of the world this person seemed to come from seemed very lively skin tones
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:11.200]   nicely exposed nicely balanced and i can't i don't i i can't think that that was an accident i think
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:15.040]   they were very very this must it must be something they worked all very hard on and something they're
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:22.640]   very very proud of justified i think too um one is one thing that uh that uh i'm not going to be very
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:30.240]   happy with is that uh the iPhone 6s the iPhone se and the iPhone 10 are no longer available and
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:37.360]   with the death of the 6s and the se uh that means that there is no longer any iPhone you can buy new
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:42.720]   that has a headphone jack so the iPhone line is now one to one hundred percent totally headphone
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:48.160]   jack free and not only that but uh even if you spend close to fifteen hundred dollars for the most
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:54.640]   expensive iPhone ever made you will not get a free nine dollar headphone dongle with it anymore because
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:59.680]   well they don't have to explain why they're already saving your life with that ekg magic watch
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:06.240]   don't complain about the nine dollar uh headphone dongle so definitely the end of an era i hope i
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:11.840]   hope this doesn't speak poorly of the chances of having headphone jacks on the next revolution of
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:18.800]   uh of ipad pros because i i really don't i really don't want to pour out a glass uh for my analog
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:24.880]   connector homies or whatever uh because that's that's that's a sad transition as far as i'm
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:30.560]   concerned i i have to admit that i i mean i was definitely one of those folks that was very upset
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:36.560]   about the whole transition you know to uh you know away from the headphone jack and even now
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:43.520]   i have an older phone that i oftentimes use for um streaming so if we're doing a uh iPhone stream
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:49.120]   to platforms that require phones um i put you know you want professional audio to go into the
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:53.200]   headphone jack when you put ethernet through the into the into the lightning port and there's no
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:57.760]   other way to do it so we still have these older phones that we're using so um so i'm you know i
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:04.000]   i'm definitely very sensitive to that process i will say though that i finally bought the airpods
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:11.120]   and then i started using the airpods and they're spilt so well they're like they're lovely i'm not
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:15.280]   saying they're not saying i'm saying but it was like one of those things like i was like oh this
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.040]   is not gonna work because i mean i have i have really good headphones you know that i i mean you
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:24.240]   know i've i've a variety of wired headphones and i have some a variety of crappy bluetooth headphones
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:30.480]   and so so i was very uh incredulous about the whole thing and then i literally last week i lost my
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:35.360]   my airpods um somewhere and i was doing a traveling i had like two hours of sleep and put it somewhere
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:40.320]   and didn't i don't know what happened to them so so anyway uh and then i really realized how
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:45.680]   painful it was because i suddenly don't have any way to you know connect and and everything else and
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.080]   so i i still use wired ones i still want i what i did is i just went did a preemptive strike and
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:53.520]   bought like four of those little converters so all my little headphones have converters on them and
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.200]   i have extra ones in my bag and i have you know you just never know when you're gonna need another
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:03.600]   converter um and uh so but i i will say that that that the my complaint about the airpods is that
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:09.280]   their ability to cut out the outside noise and you know that that you know and really isolate things
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:13.920]   is pretty low and then they don't stay in my ears as well as i'd like them to like i have
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.000]   jabra you know these jabra sports that that will actually do a much better job they don't have
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.040]   the same range and they don't sound quite as good or they sound better they got those silicone tips
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:28.160]   and they're don't they they do and they they have better bass and they have you know they they're
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:33.520]   better bass they're they're um they they sound better they just don't cover they don't cover the
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:39.200]   same area that the that the um uh that the airpods do and so and the airpods the big thing about
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.520]   it is it's even just that it's nice having a little case but there's something about the case there's
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.840]   something about charging the case and having the thing and them slipping in and and it's so natural
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:52.720]   like it very very first i want you setting them down i said i'm down somewhere but it got so used
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.080]   to that that little case was in my pocket all the time and i you know you kind of
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:04.080]   charge up and i have i have one of my uh grand my grandfather's old lighters and i've never smoked
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.800]   but i always kept it partly because it was my grandpa's but also it's just so sad it's something
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.480]   satisfying about click click click click click click click and that's the case that i that airpod
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:19.360]   case has the same thing and so it was just there's something about it it's so well built it so
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:24.320]   makes you want to put them back in the case and the charging is so effortless and the and the
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:29.040]   process of pairing them is effortless and even you and i because i'm switching between my ipad and my
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.400]   my phone and my computer and and using them in a lot of different ways and it's relevant they get
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:38.560]   it does they get a little confused when you start when you only use them with your phone they're great
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.600]   whether you use them with your phone or your ipad if your ipads in your backpack they'll like
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:47.680]   prepare to it you'll be like i don't understand what's going on here and so so i um uh but but i
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:53.680]   think that i i think apple did a pretty good job better than they've done in the past of the
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:59.360]   transition so you know apple has been known to just we're not going on a new track and you know
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.640]   you're all going to have to find your way because you know like when you look at the transition on
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.640]   final cut pro is a good example of we're just going to go to a new new thing there's no training
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:12.080]   wheels there's no like if you don't like it in in many ways apple i think did this in a much better
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:17.840]   way where they you know released something new gave you a dongle they you know they still had
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:21.680]   another one that was on sale for that you could still use your headphones and they you know and
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:27.440]   they slowly this transition i think apple is doing better than it has in the past but i will say that
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:37.200]   now i find uh when i'm wired i find to be very um it makes me uh uncomfortable like i you're making
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.360]   the dongle sound a little bit like the compact spare in the back of your trunk where we're going
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:47.760]   to give you this now remember you could only travel for 40 miles at 50 miles an hour if you
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.920]   but we're not going to let you run it for that more longer longer than that so that's that's the
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:56.320]   we're we're going to give you this dongle that it's only going to be good until you lose it and
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:02.640]   you'll will lose it at which point we fully expect you to buy airpods or bluetooth headphones i just
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.920]   it was one of those things that i i was very it took me a long time i only got the airpods very
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.720]   recently you know like last couple months and uh i was just i was not going to move to wireless
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:20.080]   dang it and uh and and now i now that i lost them like i gotta go on a big trip tomorrow and i have
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.760]   to go to the apple store and get a replacement chair because i just can't i can't bear the idea
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.960]   that i'm going to go on this trip without my airpods you know it's so it's it they definitely did this
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:34.160]   transition better to a point and and it really is like once you get used to them it is very difficult
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:40.480]   to uh it's just it's just it's very difficult to go back because you're you feel very like
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:46.000]   contained you know like you you know like you keep on pulling your your your your um earphones
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.560]   out when you're doing something and they get caught on stuff and it's just you just you forget how you
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:55.440]   you didn't i didn't realize how much of a pain in the neck headphones were until i had no headphones
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:00.240]   that actually worked i've gotten bluetooth systematically for years like i get a bluetooth
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:03.920]   every year trying and i'm like nope this one still sucks you know like nope this one still sucks
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:08.640]   and for and for anybody and for anybody who's who wasn't watching the video when Steve Aquino was
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:14.400]   was Skyping in from the back of a car on those way back from the event if you thought the audio
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:20.800]   was pretty good he was using as his as a speaker and microphone a pair of airpods that are really
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.320]   kind of quite amazing yeah Kelly Kelly is is there anything we're going to we're going to take our
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:31.600]   next break and then go to pics of the week but Kelly is is there anything that you wanted to say
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:37.440]   that we haven't said yet about uh about the the new iPhones or any of the ridiculousness that
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:43.680]   we have either created for ourselves or noted in apple uh well one of the things i brought up at
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.640]   the beginning of the show was uh the lack of ipad i'm still sort of holding out maybe ipads
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:54.400]   rate their own event um i don't know but i would i don't imagine that what they want to do with the
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:59.520]   ipad whatever that may be is going to be a press release release i think i feel like it's probably
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:03.600]   going to require tim to come out on stage and tell us about it and if that's the case
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.600]   then um it probably should happen before christmas so i'm still hoping that there's still something
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:12.880]   that's going to happen there uh the thing that i think is interesting about these these new phones
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:18.560]   that are new and exciting and i don't know if you've heard but all the phones are new um is that they
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:26.240]   are all coming with the same dumb original issue teeny little five-watch charger that has a usba
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:34.560]   portnet and like i feel like you know i i know they have a higher battery capacity i know that
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.400]   they're capable of fast charging and other capable of wireless charging i'm not saying you need to
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:46.400]   pack a a Qi charging pad in every box or anything like that but maybe a usba cable and like show
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:51.680]   off to with with a usba charger and maybe show people how much faster they can charge uh you know
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.880]   give people the opportunity to sort of optionally get their feet wet i feel like that would be a
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:03.120]   good idea to sort of ease in the usba transition for people who don't buy a new computer every
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.800]   like i haven't bought in a new lap i haven't purchased a new laptop in the last couple years
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:13.040]   and so uh all my stuff is still usba and i have a regular standard issue magsafe charger so i
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.320]   don't have to worry about any usba stuff so this would be a really nice way to sort of ease people
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:23.840]   into the usba see inevitable transition you know as people buy new computers and things like that's
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:27.920]   something they're already going to have to do so it would be nice if they would uh sort of
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:34.320]   nudge that into standard usage by giving people a really cool charger that charges way faster than
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:38.880]   the one that they're going to get in the box already because now on top of spending a thousand
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.240]   dollars on a phone you have to go buy a new charger in order to get anything that's going to do it with
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:48.560]   any sort of appreciable speed yeah you're absolutely right i think it's one thing that
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:54.000]   consistently disappoints me about apple is that they often just come across as cheap skates that
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.240]   if someone is spending a minimum of a thousand dollars on your top of the line luxury stainless
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:05.680]   steel phone why not give them a nine dollar and adapter that they otherwise charge nine bucks for
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:12.160]   and doesn't it feel after you've after well you're still sort of trembling from the shock of having
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:17.600]   two days later press that buy it now button on a fifteen hundred dollar phone isn't it nice when
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:23.200]   you open it up to see oh this isn't that's cheap what looks like could be even a chinese knockoff
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:29.360]   five watt charger here is an actual like 18 watt adapter so it will actually uh support fast charging
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:33.680]   doesn't that make you feel like you did invest in the top of the line thing you're not getting the
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:39.440]   same thing that dare i say the riff-ref are using to charge their iPhones with i i think that the
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:45.440]   only thing is that is that my whole ecosystem now and i i'm maybe i'm anomaly so i you know that but
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:50.080]   my whole ecosystem has usb chargers everywhere you know i have i have this this is the one that
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:54.160]   i don't know if i can't pull it out of the camera but see i just pulled it up by its by its pieces
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:58.080]   there you know like but this is my these are the plugs that we have we've got five of them in there
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:03.280]   and i and i won't i won't put a single charger no matter what powerful how powerful it is i'm not
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:09.360]   gonna give up bag space for a single unit charger you know so everything is five you know five usb's
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.480]   and they're all 2.4 and they're all you know that's the way and and i i buy them and put them in the
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:19.920]   wall you know we just we just cut holes in one of our tables in our in our green room to to install
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:26.640]   outlets and usb chargers you know and and uh so the thing is is that it i think that it's kind of
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.840]   like here we're giving you something that's minimally does what you needed to do we know you're probably
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.720]   not gonna like it but but no one should be you know what i'm sorry i don't think anybody should be
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:41.200]   carrying around a single you we all have so many devices but whether it's our phone and everything
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.400]   else like you should just go out and get something that's better because it's you're gonna you're
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:48.880]   never gonna work it's it's a stupid little single unit piece it doesn't even have two ports it doesn't
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:54.240]   even have two ports if you are a person with a watch that that power plug is useless yeah you're
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.280]   right you need five i think well i i just the right number i don't and then i can i ship that with
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:04.720]   you but that's what you should have as an owner of electronic equipment five two point four i do
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.680]   but you know like everybody you could give me two ports like give me an ipad charger
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:15.200]   form factor you know the slightly taller brick with two ports it attempts you to to to avoid
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:21.280]   the inevitable which is that you need five five usb ports okay i'll let me okay but i know i
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:27.040]   know i know i know five regular people maybe two so not not everybody has that that wonderful
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:32.720]   zoology of power bricks that they've acquired over the past two or three years some of them
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:39.360]   are upgrading from like an inferior from an inferior phone and that and i will close by by
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:45.760]   using the the dill pickle analogy okay now if i if i if i get a sandwich like at the cheap
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:50.560]   sub-shop or cost like four and a half bucks they wrap it in paper they shove it to me and i get
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:55.040]   it okay that's fine but there's another there's a coffee shop nearby that makes a wonderful sandwich
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:01.600]   for twelve dollars thirteen dollars fresh cut meat seasonings custom mayo and stuff like that
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:06.720]   okay and they put it in a paper an abasket and serve it to me and there's like a slice there's
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:12.640]   like a dill pickle spear in there do i want the dill pickle spear no do i eat the dill pickle spear
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.720]   no but i feel as though by if i'm paying twelve dollars for a sandwich they're showing me a sign
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.840]   of respect by giving me a dill pickle spear by saying thank you for not going to that horrible
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:29.520]   place where it's where the prices are suspiciously low and you're not going to know how this is going
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:33.920]   to turn out until this thing makes its way all the way through your digestive system thank you
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:40.000]   let let us show which is so that our show your uh thanks for your if your increased taste and
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.880]   your deeper pockets by giving you a dill pickle spear i feel as though an 18 watt adapter is a
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:49.760]   dill pickle spear the people who don't have one they could use they could certainly use another one
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:54.320]   the people who and if you already have one again maybe you have one that you can give to a friend
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:00.160]   but at any in any event after having spent a thousand dollars on a phone to get like an actual
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.880]   real charger that is more useful than just simply here are two blades that are connected
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.480]   that connect like with just for for for all you know the for the size and the weight you feel
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:16.000]   like you got these two blades that go right from the outlet via a couple of wires directly into the
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.040]   phone with not without anything in between them so that that's just my feeling give me the give me
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:26.480]   the damn pickle spear even if i'm not going to eat it myself yeah but that's that's that's
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.800]   organic waste you're talking about like with me i opened the thing up i barely even take it out
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:35.440]   of the box like i have a little box full of all those stupid little chargers that i just kind of
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:41.760]   throw it into i'm like i can use that you know and so this is this is waste this is electronic
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:46.800]   waste of us that we're not going to use because we know better we know five people gonna get me
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:53.040]   for returning all those chargers to them five five five five five five okay i've got a drawer full
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:58.000]   of five watt adapters because they're no of they're of no damn use to me in any way shape or form
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:05.440]   despite all the different devices i have that charge by usb however i am often replacing like
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:12.640]   really good like your 10 20 watt marshmallow power bricks by anchor or by apple because i use
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:18.400]   them all the time and i maybe can't find it because i packed it in my suitcase the last time i traveled
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:23.840]   i didn't unpack it those are the ones that never get wasted it's these little drinky dank five dollar
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:31.200]   peds dispenser style things that i think is the real waste we will be back with our picks of the

[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.680]   our picks and or tips let's start with Alex so by the way just just to reiterate in fact six
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:03.760]   six this is this is the one that I carry around this is made by anchor I think it's called a power
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:07.520]   port six if you're buying one of these now that you've heard the show and we've talked about the
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:11.040]   fact that you should throw away that little single one or give it to your friends or give it to
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:15.120]   charity or whatever Christmas decorations I've got I got like nine years ago this year
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:21.280]   exactly stick them all together and it's like it's like a geeky erector set so but once you start
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:26.560]   doing it you know five or six you should make sure that they're all 2.4s and they it has to have a
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:31.120]   light so by the way no matter how cool it looks if it doesn't have a light you won't know whether
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:36.800]   the whatever you're plugging into it the airport is is actually powering it so make sure that it
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:40.480]   has a light that's my little thing you don't have to buy an anchor one I have an anchor one one
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:46.080]   that's what I do too that's not my pick that's not my pick um uh my pick is this it's me my
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:52.080]   we're oh this is the cutest little thing so check this out it's like nine oh yep so so yeah look at
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:57.440]   that guy look at that's a black one and um see what you just you just drop it in here see like see if
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:02.080]   you if you look at it here that you get the little it charges it won't charge now because it's uh
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.720]   because it's not plugged in but but it it charges it so you just plug your little guy in here and
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.640]   you have it sitting on your desk and it works so well I bought I don't know where I saw it I was
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:16.000]   like oh that looks really funny so I put it on and and there's the funny thing about it is is that I
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:24.560]   uh I often knock my watch around and pop it off of its magnetic um thing I don't I'm not a big fan
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:29.200]   of the magnet and uh and so being able to stick it in there and know it's going to kind of stay in
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:33.520]   there while I'm doing stuff is great and it looks cool and it just gives you a place to just kind
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:38.480]   of throw your watch in and so I I don't wrap my watch around that I just literally just drop it in
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:43.440]   there and let it charge but there's something about it that calls to you to charge your watch when you
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:47.360]   you come in in the morning and so uh so anyway it's a that's my thing it's cute
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:53.520]   I know now that the new apple watches are like a little bit bigger they can have to like come
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:57.200]   up with a new version of that it's pretty to look like the apple like the like the Mac TV
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:02.000]   I don't know it's pretty bendy so I think I think that you'll still be able to slide it in there I
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.480]   don't think it I don't think you'll need to upgrade it for uh for the new watch that doesn't
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:11.280]   sound like the design motif of someone who paints the side of the fence you can't see Alex
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:20.240]   exactly there's that what was I thinking I will gladly buy a new one to upgrade my watch stand
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:25.040]   if it turns out that my series four doesn't charge in that I think Alex when you know that up and
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:29.040]   you said I don't know where I thought I'm like it was my Twitter feed Alex it might have been your
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:32.720]   Twitter feed it was probably a Twitter feed that I saw it I was just like oh this is great
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.320]   because I posted more than one picture of it I adore it I bought like as soon as I bought it I've
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:42.960]   put a bunch of pictures up about it because I think it's super duper cute and it's just the
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:47.280]   right mix of old school and new school because it charges an apple watch but it looks like you
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:53.040]   know an se and I just I love it so so much it makes me so happy um and the footnote to that is I
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:59.440]   do want to point out to people that you have a nice short apple watch charger cord on there um I
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:05.120]   have one I carry around in my battery because again original apple watch so um I carry around my
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:10.080]   battery pack not for my phone but in order to charge my watch so I bought one of those little
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:16.160]   short cables and it comes in super handy the thing that I have to point out is another um
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:24.720]   can be useful but is also mostly fun sort of a utility um and this is a kickstarter and before
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:29.600]   I tell you anything about it I'm gonna give you full disclosure this is by Victor Agretta who was
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:35.120]   the editor in chief at the unofficial apple web log for many years and so technically I used to
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.680]   work for him back in the day when I wrote for Tua when there was still Tua available to people
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:46.560]   um so this is a thing that Victor put together and it's called kitten things done kitten things
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:55.600]   done it makes me so happy it's a kickstarter and he's built this deck of cards and you use it sort
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:00.000]   of on top of your existing management system for however it is that you accomplish what you
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:07.760]   accomplish in your 24 hour units of time and so uh you have like you know 30 minutes for lunch and
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:14.240]   and things for planning and things for mail and different stuff and uh you um play those throughout
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:18.880]   the day it's a little bit of a gamified system and you play the cards throughout the day in order
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:22.480]   to make sure that you're on track with the stuff that you need to do and continuing to
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:29.040]   accomplish the stuff that you need to accomplish and um I think it's adorable uh he's got a load
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:34.640]   of different people who all did different art for the cards which is super great um I also like
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:40.720]   that he's got cards like for flex time or you know um you can always like if you get to a point in
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:44.960]   your day when you're like I just don't know what I need to do you can pull out a card and you know
[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:50.480]   at random and it's like okay spend half an hour on email or whatever and uh you build your deck
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:56.800]   however it is that you need to have it and I really I enjoy the idea of it um I think all of the cards
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:03.600]   are adorable I love the artwork and uh it's it seems like a really reasonable goal that he has set
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:08.560]   for the fundraising because it's a six thousand dollar goal and it's already at twelve hundred
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:14.400]   dollars right now and one of the things that I like about it is that uh part of the money goes to
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:22.400]   pet rescue specifically like cat rescue and cat support charity so um as an added bonus you can sort
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:28.080]   of do something good uh for kittens in the world and I think that's pretty great so um that's my
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:34.800]   pick great uh mine is more of a tip than anything else and this certainly not because I was working
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.920]   so hard today I forgot to get a tip ready uh pick ready uh but okay look if you got anything that
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:45.680]   uses uses rechargeable batteries like my my camera here uh obviously you should have like a whole
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.840]   bunch of them and so that you can have one charging back in the hotel room while you're out
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:55.520]   gallivanting with the other one or while you're shooting shooting at everything and everything
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:01.200]   while you're out without having to worry about uh having to change uh however uh I unfortunately
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:05.120]   was a couple so I have like three or four of these and it was a couple of years before I realized
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:10.800]   it was important to do this which is to put some sort of mark on each one of them so that you know
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:17.200]   which one is which uh you might guess that my first three were called mo larry and curly uh I
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:22.400]   now had I bought a fourth one this year now that that one's called shimp uh because it's important
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:26.560]   it's important to know so give something memorable that you're going to remember so that you know
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:30.720]   when you uh at the like in the middle of the day when you're looking for another fresh battery
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:35.040]   you know the oh no larry I've already burned through larry's shimp is the one I haven't used yet
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:42.320]   or as you're mixing and matching as you acquire new and old batteries uh you know that okay curly is
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:48.080]   is like is a four-year-old battery been recharge and charged like a thousand times it's all I really
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:52.480]   want shimp because shimp is the the one I just bought two months ago if I leave the house with
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:57.360]   just shimp shimp will carry me through the entire day if I leave the house with curly I'm going to
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:02.320]   need at least larry or mo to back it up as well as that uh and the simplest damn thing the nicest
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.560]   things I ever bought for myself was a professional label maker like this in one of those brother
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:12.800]   p touch deals uh and yes you will go nuts labeling each individual piece of fruit uh inside your
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:17.840]   ins inside the fridge and each individual egg because it's just like it's almost like a chainsaw
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:21.920]   in terms of organization once you use it for the thing that you bought it for you want to find
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:27.840]   other things to use it on because it's just too fun to use it on we we have a lot of life
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:34.160]   if you have a yeah go ahead Alex I was gonna say we have a we label a lot of things and uh yeah the
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:38.240]   p touches is what is kind of our standard when I have a different I have a different one that
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:42.480]   metal doesn't metal but but it's I can't remember what the name of it is but but the um but the
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:46.400]   p-touch one is what we use for almost everything we have but the funny the funny thing about batteries
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:51.680]   uh as a note the cannon batteries so they have a little piece of plastic that you usually lose
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:57.360]   pretty quickly that that clicks onto it it took me years to realize that there's a little box
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:03.680]   in that little safety thing that if you put it on one way it shows the battery in the print on the
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:08.960]   on the on the uh battery if you turn it the other way it doesn't show the battery so and it's there
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:12.640]   literally so that if you once you've used it you turn it over and pluck it in and someone showed
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:18.800]   it to me I was like what what you know like mind blown like I was always like it didn't even occur
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:21.840]   to me like why is there a little square there you know the square is there so that you put it on
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:24.800]   the other way when you when you take it out of the camera so that you don't use it again and you
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:28.400]   know how many you have but it was just like uh the only thing I tell you about the the label
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.800]   the one thing we learned with the with the cannons by the way also is always put the label on the top
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:36.800]   because if you put it on the side it gets stuck in the camera and then you need a thing yes pull
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:42.080]   it out yeah so footnote to the p-touch conversation is that stuff at my house is also labeled with
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:46.960]   a silver sharpie because you can take a silver sharpie and you can write on all those weird
[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:52.480]   black power adapters that don't yeah there you go that don't say anything uh hell you log in
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:57.920]   that by the way I'm not really in a regulation but let me tell you you should be legally required
[01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:03.120]   to print on your power supply what that power supply was voltage what voltage and water you
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:11.680]   did yes I have crates cray and I kid you know I'll post a picture at some point I have crates of
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:15.920]   unmatched power supplies like I don't know if they're still useful or not you know like they're
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.960]   there where you're right and throwing away because you don't know what you're gonna need them well
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:24.160]   because not everything says like I bought this with a net gear router and the power brick says net
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:28.160]   gear on it maybe it does maybe it doesn't you don't know and like a lot of stuff that you get
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:33.760]   doesn't have doesn't have the same name so you can't even narrow down like I know this powers
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:38.640]   some Logitech thing I bought like you can't even get that far it doesn't say anything useful on it
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:43.680]   so usually what happens is the minute I get one I whip out the silver sharpie and I scribble on
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:49.360]   it like it goes to this whatever and then at least from there like sometimes I can go put on you know
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:54.400]   an actual label for whatever it is you know if if it turns out to be something you know in particular
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:58.640]   but for the most part at least I make sure that there's some indicator on that of what the heck
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:05.600]   it goes to yeah yeah and also and also because you never know what the when I when I might throw
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:10.000]   out like an old Wi-Fi router but I will keep the AC adapter just in case I need something that
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.960]   needs that kind of power so that's that's why I will I will also use that that metal marker
[02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:20.880]   to label this is 12 volts and two watts so that if I'm trying to find something that fits this
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:27.680]   plug that is exactly 12 volts and two watts I don't have to go why do they write things in gray
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:33.840]   on a black background at that size it's almost as if they don't want me to use this but we got we
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:39.920]   got it worse go ahead that was all it's like worse when they do it in gray on a black
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:46.880]   power adapter yes thank you and and it's amazing how many versions we got into the long discussion
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:51.920]   one time because we're trying to really sort our cables out of there's the outer diameter outer
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:55.680]   diameter the inner diameter and you have to keep track of those and there's the amps and the
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:02:01.840]   voltage and then there's for us is an English plug or is it a UK plug or an American plug
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:07.200]   UK plug European plug it so there's all these like iterations and it's become it makes it very
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:12.000]   hard to sort because there's too many places like you need so many shelves you know of which
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:18.560]   there may only be two and then some others have 40 and you know it's just very very bitter okay
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:25.680]   before before we get into a religious war about power adapters and nomenclature we should say goodbye
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:30.160]   for this episode of Mac Break Weekly Alex Lindsey the Pitz-Quicksal core thank you very much
