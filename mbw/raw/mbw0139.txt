[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.560]   He does.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.680]   He has slippers, he's jammies, he comes on down.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.120]   And he says, "Is there anything to eat?"
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.920]   "Yes, I leave my pipe upstairs."

[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.840]   I saw the buffalo now.

[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.640]   so I'll just put it on the hat.

[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   At least you've got hair.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   >> So I think the big story, which is really,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   I think, a non-story, but I might as well mention it
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.640]   right off the top, the rumor started by fast company
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.640]   that Apple might conceivably buy Twitter.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   They say they're actually in talks to buy Twitter.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.640]   >> It is crazy, yes.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.640]   >> It is crazy, yes.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   >> $700 million.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.640]   And send your hate mail to Leo since he brought this up.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   >> Well, I know, I'm going to get out of the way,
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640]   but I don't think it's credible on the fence.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640]   >> Oh, well, it clicks into a rumor I heard
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.640]   that Apple's crazy uncle left them $3 trillion
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.640]   with a surprise, so it spends $1 billion in 30 days
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640]   and have no tangible assets left over.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   >> It turns out that Apple has been shorting the banks
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.640]   for the last six months.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   >> I think that's one of those movie books
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   that didn't get sold, Andy.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   >> Well, it basically got the idea from the Richard Pryor
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.640]   movie, Brewster's Millions.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640]   >> There you go.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   >> It wasn't a bad movie, so who knows?
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   >> So I don't think Twitter is even for sale.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   Does it make any sense?
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   Is there any reason why Apple would want?
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   >> Uh-oh.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.640]   >> Well, they're just not in the business of simply
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.640]   acquiring things for the sake of acquiring them.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.640]   If there was a way that this would hook into anything else
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   that they were doing, then maybe.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.640]   >> That's precisely why I asked the question.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   Apple, of all, if you said Yahoo, okay, I'd say,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.640]   yeah, sure, of course they're going to buy it.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.640]   That's what they do.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   They buy things they don't know what to do with.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.640]   If you said eBay, if you said almost anybody, but Apple--
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.640]   >> Apple's very focused.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   >> They seem pretty focused.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   >> What would they do with it?
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   >> I mean, the argument--
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640]   >> I mean, the argument--
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   >> It doesn't fit into anything they're doing that I'm aware of
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   unless they just want to buy it because, I don't know,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   the same dream fairy that gave Steve the idea for the iPhone
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   says, now you ought to do a social network.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   >> Yeah, I just think that it's not something that, you know,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.640]   it is something exactly what you said, Leo.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   It's something that you see Yahoo do or they do, but I just don't
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   think that Apple--
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   >> Remember they had Eworld.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.640]   I mean, they did try to do an online service.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.640]   >> Oh, that's what it's--
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   >> That's a good point.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.640]   >> Yeah, Doc Mac is nothing.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.640]   But Eworld, remember, had a little town?
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640]   >> I do remember that.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.640]   >> Your face was a little town and you'd go around a little town
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.640]   and it was kind of--
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   >> It was cute.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   >> Well, the quantum link, AOL, before it was AOL,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.640]   was called Quantum Link, and it was Apple only.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.640]   And Eworld was kind of, I think, to replace Quantum Link.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   >> You're going deep cataloging.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.640]   >> I know.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   >> You're going deep cataloging.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   >> I know, but that was in the days when it--
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   >> Come on.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   >> --of AOL, when the walled gardens, when the internet access,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.640]   it seemed like a good idea to provide your customers with
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.640]   internet access.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.640]   Microsoft was doing it with MSN, it was AOL.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   >> Right.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   >> So I can't see it.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   >> IBM was even in that game.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.640]   >> Really?
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.640]   >> IBM had their own private internet services,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.640]   the first advertiser on net radio.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   Well, this is a ridiculous rumor on the face of it.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.640]   We're going to throw it out.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.640]   >> Which is why it's the number one show on this week's
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.640]   Mac Break.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.640]   >> Well, it's the number one story to get rid of it.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.640]   And you know who knows, tomorrow we could be like with
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.640]   egg on our face, but it's a stupid idea.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   I don't think Twitter is for sale.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.640]   B, I can't see why Apple wants it.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   >> Wait, wait, wait.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.640]   I can solve this real quickly.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.640]   Let me ask you an important question.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   Did you buy any particular social networking company in the
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   last few days?
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.640]   >> No, you know what I did buy.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   I was very scared.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.640]   The Apple store was down on Sunday, and I had just bought
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.640]   Mac books from my mom and my wife and my sister,
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   and I thought they're going to update the Mac book.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   >> And I'm going to tell you, make sure you buy like four of
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.640]   the new Kindles today.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.640]   >> Yeah, you did get a Kindle digital deal.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.640]   >> Yeah, you did get a Kindle digital deal.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.640]   >> Guess what I got for my other day for my mom?
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.640]   >> I know.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.640]   >> I got a Kindle.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.640]   >> Which means that we--
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   >> Guess what's happening tomorrow, Leah?
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   >> A new Kindle is coming out, but first of all--
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   >> It's not the same thing.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   >> I don't think, we will see, but I don't think A that it will
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.640]   be available tomorrow, it may be.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   >> Yeah. >> But more importantly, I don't think it's a
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.640]   consumer device, it really looks to me like it's designed for
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   two things, it's designed for college textbooks, and that may
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   be the main point of it, and it's designed secondarily for
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.640]   a newspaper, because the newspapers don't like the Kindle
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.640]   because it's so hard to browse, it's too small.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   >> Now, here's the question though, is that why newspapers
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.640]   don't like it or a lot of the rumors that they don't like the
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   fact that Amazon is controlling the ordering process?
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.640]   >> Well, that's why Conde Nast, of course, or was it
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   Hearst, I can't remember.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.640]   >> It was going to be Hearst.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   >> It's going to be Hearst.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   >> So Hearst was going to make their own?
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   >> And they are.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.640]   >> But what information do we have that newspapers
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.640]   specifically don't like the Kindle?
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.640]   >> Well, there's been a lot of complaints of the newspapers
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   that have been floating around that the newspapers don't like
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.640]   the fact that, I can try to find it, but I just read it
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.640]   somewhere, that's why I said it, you're right to ask to
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   challenge me on it, because I don't, I don't, I don't, I'll
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   let you know. >> I'm not sure.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   >> No, they don't like the fact that Amazon is saying to
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.640]   us. >> I didn't talk to anybody particularly, but that
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.640]   would make sense that the, well, here's the story that I
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.640]   read, and I can't wish I'll have to see if I can find it.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   But it's said in that story about the new Kindle that one of
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   the reasons publishers were make, wanted to make their own
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.640]   device is because, hey, the Kindle isn't good for browsing,
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.640]   and I agree with that.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.640]   I mean, that resonated with me.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.640]   I do not like reading newspapers on the Kindle.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   It's very, you can't browse.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   I don't know if that's a size thing.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.640]   >> Yeah, turn 10 pages at a time.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   You can't like skip like three to four sections.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   >> Think how you, yeah, think how you use a newspaper,
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   at least I do, I spread it out.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   I scan, looking for stuff I'm interested in.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   I might read that, turn the page, scan some more.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   The Kindle just doesn't do that.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   >> It's good for page to page with, you know, it's easy to
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.640]   move page to page, but I agree.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.640]   It's a little bit cumbersome if you wanted to read a newspaper.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.640]   I have no problem reading blogs on it, but I haven't, I
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   likewise have not been successful enjoying a newspaper on
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   the Kindle. >> All right, story three.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.640]   We're moving right along.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   Blackberry curve outsells the iPhone again.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.640]   This is kind of another, I'm going to, these are some bogus
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.640]   stories we got here.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.640]   This story, NDP, the research group says that the curve has
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.640]   sold more in the last quarter than the iPhone, what they, they
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.640]   don't reveal exact sales figures, but they say the curve was a
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.640]   number one selling smart phone for the three months of 2009.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.640]   Of course, the curve is sold on three or four different
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.640]   carriers.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.640]   The iPhone is only on AT&T.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   So I don't know if that's a fair comparison.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   iPhone was second followed by the storm, which is Verizon only.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.640]   >> How many of the curves were returned?
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   >> Just to ask you questions.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   >> It doesn't matter how many you sold, it matter how many
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.640]   people sold, you know, bottom and kept them.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.640]   >> There is a perception, I have to say out there that the
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   iPhone is a toy, which I think is completely wrong, but there
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.640]   is that perception.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.640]   >> Well, the curve has always been, the curve is, is blackberry
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.640]   and blackberry has always been the business leader in smart
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   phones.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   And for at least a while, I think it's reasonable to assume that
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.640]   they'll continue that dominance.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.640]   There are plenty of IT systems that are already tacked into
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.640]   the blackberry and, you know, the IT guys don't want to get
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.640]   that call that says we're switching everything to iPhone.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   I mean, you know, it's not unreasonable that they would
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   continue to do well there.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   And the question is, is, you know, these new devices, how
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.640]   stable are they?
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   >> Well, and I think that the issue is that there's an entire
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.640]   ecosystem building up around the iPhone, the way we saw it
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.640]   built around the iPod or iTunes.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.640]   And I think that's going to be the thing that in the long
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.640]   term, whether there's a good quarter or bad quarter for blackberry,
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.640]   you know, that they don't have, you know, these applications,
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.640]   I think are going to be a big deal.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   And as we start to see the ability to connect hardware to the
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.640]   iPhone and to possibly to this infamous media pad, you know,
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.640]   what we're looking at are people being able to build interfaces,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.640]   you know, that really just tie, you know, tie this into a lot of
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.640]   things other than just being a phone, you know, and I think that
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.640]   that's the, you know, in the long term, I think that that's the
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   killer app that I think a lot of people are not, you know, that
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   the blackberry is never going to do.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   >> Good news for Apple, though.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.640]   Consumer reports, you got a clean sweep on the consumer reports
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.640]   they're rating laptops.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.640]   And Apple ranks first in the 13 inch category, the 14 to 16 inch
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.640]   category, the 17 inch list.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.640]   Dell, Toshiba and Hewlett Packard also ran the 15 inch
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.640]   MacBook Pro was rated best overall, score 75 out of a
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.640]   hundred, beating the satellite among desktops.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   Here's a weird one.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.640]   The consumer reports rated the HP Pavilion slim line number one
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.640]   and the Mac mini number two, the iMac place behind a Dell XPS
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   one.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.640]   That's just nuts.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.640]   But they do like the Apple laptops.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.640]   They kind of ruin their credibility, though, when they say
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   that Dell one is better than the iMac.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.640]   I mean, that's just --
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   >> Well, I have to say this whole notion that slim anything
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.640]   is good bothers me.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.640]   Just slim line choice.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.640]   >> That's the resident rotundity on the show.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.640]   I believe the slim line --
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.640]   >> Sure they're sexy, but that's not going to get you through
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.640]   a long Russian winner.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.640]   >> That's not.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   Go with the winning horse.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.640]   >> As president of the horizontally challenged computer
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   users of America, I'm against the slim line.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   >> Well, anyway, they did say that the MacBooks were good choices.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   Another reason why they probably will announce them.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.640]   >> Didn't they just get the power award to J.D.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.640]   >> J.D.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   >> Power for best customer service?
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.640]   >> Satisfaction, I think.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   >> That's the satisfaction.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   >> The J.D.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   Power satisfaction.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.640]   >> Which I think also ties to another news item.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   You might have seen Leo or not forgive me if it was already
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.640]   on the list, but this seems like a good segue to it.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.640]   There was a rumor that Apple might be considering price cuts.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.640]   >> Well, I like that rumor.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   I hadn't heard that.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   >> Yes.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   >> But now I understand that that's going to be popular, but I have to say if that rumor
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.640]   is true, it doesn't quite make as much sense given A, we just heard about how great their
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   customer satisfaction is at the current price level and how well they're selling and how
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   well they're scoring.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   >> Well, they're not selling that well though.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.640]   Last quarter sales were down considerably.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.640]   This is the first drop in six years.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.640]   >> Yeah, but wait a minute.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.640]   Whose sales were like stellar last quarter?
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   >> No, no, of course, everybody was down.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   >> I think that's a fair comparison.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   Let's look at this.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.200]   The thing that I just want to bring up, if this rumor is getting a lot of people excited,
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.640]   remember, this is kind of contrary to the Apple business model of we've got something
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:40.560]   special and the quickest way to ruin the cool factor in a brand like Ferrari or Cadillac
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.640]   is start deep discounting.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.640]   >> Well, yeah, I know you're right.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:51.480]   I mean, because that ruins your reputation if you start, you know, you look at what Microsoft
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.640]   is doing, there's yet another cheap laptop ad out there.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   This one is really goofy.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.640]   Person says, I want to edit video.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.640]   >> And they're going to use a cheap laptop.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.640]   >> They end up with a $2,000 HP.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   All three of the ads have been HP laptops by the way.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.640]   >> So they end up with a $2,000 HP laptop because they're going to edit video on, I guess,
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   Movie Maker.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   >> Well, you know, I see people do video.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.640]   I was at NEB and I saw someone do video on a PC.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.640]   Oh, it's pretty sad.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   >> And I just see it and I'm like, wow, you really do that.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   I'm so confused.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   >> So Alex, were lots of this year's movies cut together on Microsoft?
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   [laughter]
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.640]   >> You know what the ads were cut together on?
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   I might add that agency is a big Apple house.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.640]   >> Right.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.640]   >> And for sure, those ads were edited on Final Cut.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.640]   >> Well, it could be Final Cut or could be Abbot.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.640]   >> You know, and if it's an Abbot, it could be on Windows.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.640]   >> It could be on Windows.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640]   >> It could be on Windows.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   >> So it's not necessarily.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.640]   It's unlikely that it's, you know, generally, I think we're at a point now where about 90%
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:58.640]   of everything out there that's edited in the higher end is either Final Cut Pro or Abbot.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.640]   I mean, those are the two that really own that market.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.640]   >> Do you know who's on top, Alex, at the moment?
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.640]   Is it Abbot?
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.640]   >> Well, in sheer numbers, and I don't know, I don't have any real detail, but from anecdotal
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.640]   evidence, in sheer numbers, it's obviously Final Cut.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   You know, as far as the pyramid, there's still probably a majority over half of the films
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   that are coming out.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:24.640]   You know, the big films that you see are still edited on Avids, but you're seeing a growing
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.640]   number of them getting edited on Final Cut Pro, and especially as you move into independent
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:35.640]   film and documentaries, you're seeing Final Cut make huge strides in these areas.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   And so it'll be, you know, we'll see how it turns out.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   But a lot of that is just a very slow process.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.640]   I mean, it took a long time for people to stop using, to start using Avid, you know, and
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   stop using those big machines, right?
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.640]   So it just takes, you know, a lot of it wraps around the editors themselves.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   You know, when you get into high end films and whatever they're comfortable with, and a
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.640]   lot of them, it's not whether the technology is better or worse, it's just a matter of
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   that they know how to use it.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   >> But you ain't using Avid on a $2,000 laptop from HP either.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   >> No.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.640]   >> No.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.640]   >> Not very quickly anyway.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.640]   >> That poor consumer stuck with Windows Movie Maker.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.640]   >> Right.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.640]   And I will say that if you really look at iMovie09 for instance, of what ships are.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   >> That's so much better.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.640]   >> Well, that's so much better.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   >> You know, we was doing a test.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.640]   >> You could get, look, you can get premier elements on Windows.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.640]   >> And it's pretty damn good.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   >> It's good.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.640]   >> It's $79.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.640]   >> Yeah, but iMovie ships with it.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.640]   >> And SAC.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   >> And if you don't have a history of editing, so if you haven't edited with a standard non-linear
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:37.640]   editor, I was trying to do a comparison between iMovie09 and Final Cut.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.040]   And what I found was that in the time it took me to set up my folder structures and get
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.640]   ready to work in Final Cut, I was done with the edit in iMovie09.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640]   It's that fast.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   Now, I don't have the same control that I have in Final Cut.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.640]   If I'm building a larger, bigger project, I would want to use Final Cut.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.640]   But it is, for the vast majority of people out there putting together home movies and
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.840]   throwing together little quick little things, it's a pretty amazing application to be shipping
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.640]   with every computer you're buying.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.640]   >> Well, not to mention GarageBand and the iPhoto.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.640]   >> Well, GarageBand and iPhoto.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.560]   >> Yeah, I mean, that's a pretty, the iLife set is a pretty good set of stuff to start
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   with out of the box.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   >> And they never talk about that in pricing comparisons.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.200]   >> Which is actually very, very unfair.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:27.360]   I mean, half the stuff that you want to do, you can do right out of the box with a basic
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:33.480]   Apple computer and very high levels of quality I might add compared with the free stuff that
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.840]   comes with most systems.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.480]   I mean, let's not, I mean, gloss over the fact you can, for 79 bucks, you can Adobe Premier
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.200]   Elements and you can do pretty good editing.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   You can do a nice job.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.000]   >> Yeah, it's just the whole interfacing the video and dealing with the data and dealing
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   with all the pieces.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.680]   >> What a real problem I think you have with a PC is that there's no hardware standard.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.120]   So you just don't know what you're getting.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   It's a variety of stuff.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.080]   I mean, some of it works better than other stuff with Apple because they control the
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.360]   hardware chain.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.160]   There's a lot more consistency.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.800]   So if you're developing software for Apple, you know what you're going to be getting.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.680]   >> Well, it's not only that when you have core video and core animation and core, you
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.080]   know, a lot of the core from the operating system.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.200]   >> We have a lot of the OS, you know, instead of having to write a lot of code to go in
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.840]   and out of something, what it means is that developers can spend more time on the interface,
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.440]   more time on the experience, more time on the Windows stuff at DV Garage, you do all
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   this stuff.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.640]   >> We do a little, what we found was we had DV Mat on both sides.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.840]   And for a while.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.440]   And we suddenly started, we really looked at what our sales were and our Windows sales
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:40.160]   were about 15% of our total market and our tech support, the Windows was 90% of the
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.080]   calls, you know, with only 15% of the sales.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.680]   And we decided that we would- >> I think it's tough to develop.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   >> Sees to develop.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   >> Had a regionius hardware.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   That's the real problem.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.320]   You don't know what video card you don't know what, you know, I mean, the whole thing
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.720]   is kind of a guessing game.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.440]   >> Yeah, and also the other thing about Mac users in general from our experience is that
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.960]   they tend to upgrade more readily.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.040]   So you're talking to someone who has the last version at most, you know, at worst they
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.360]   have the last version of Final Cut.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.440]   >> There is that standard in the Apple word that everybody's using Leopard, whereas in
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.320]   the Windows world, tons of people are using XP.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.600]   >> Well, you can make an application on a Mac and just say it's Leopard only.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.840]   >> And people will just go, right off.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   >> Right off.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   >> You know, if I needed to upgrade it.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.560]   So I'm just hanging on to the only reason people hang on to older operating systems is
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.000]   because some of their software hasn't been updated yet.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   >> Some real newbies though.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   I mean, I'm my neighbors.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.880]   I was really shocked when I went up there and they were still using Panther and I couldn't.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.120]   You know, I wanted to put some- >> Wow.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.560]   Yeah, wow, it's right.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.880]   >> We still have one machine running OS9.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   >> Wow.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.880]   >> That's a big wow.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.880]   >> And why is that?
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.880]   >> Why would you do that?
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   >> Why was it custom?
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.520]   >> It has a custom inventory program that was written for us in OS9.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.520]   >> Right, right.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.520]   >> And the guy- >> Right.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.520]   >> The software company went out of business.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.320]   So if we want to use it, we have to and it's really good.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.520]   Hey, here's some Schotten Freud.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.000]   The music industry, remember they were the ones who twisted Apple's arm to allow variable
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   pricing.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.560]   Turns out those new Buck 29 downloads are not selling so well.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   Ouch.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.880]   Overall, revenue is moving downward, lower unit sales.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.800]   Even with a new $1.29 price.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:21.120]   It's not just top tracks, in fact, the broad catalog of songs.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.920]   Music fans maybe just don't want to pay a Buck 29.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.960]   Maybe Steve Jobs was right all along.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.040]   >> I still think it gets you into this position where you see something more expensive and
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.840]   you go, oh, I think I'll just wait and see if that's going to drop.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.080]   >> If everything were a Buck 29, maybe.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.080]   >> Right.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.080]   >> You're right.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.520]   By comparison, you're looking around $99.99, a Buck 29.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.200]   Oh, wait.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.520]   And I'll tell you the truth of what you're really competing against is limewire.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.040]   You're really competing against the fact that the people who buy music, kids have no
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.400]   compunction at all saying, oh, I'm just going to download it.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   They really don't.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.040]   My son, I'm driving to school, he says, can I get limewire?
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.360]   I said, no.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.640]   He said, but all these, oh, this is why, by the way.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.800]   And this is another telling point.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.640]   He says, all the songs are on my iPhone and I can't get them on my laptop.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.040]   So I'm just going to get them from limewire.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.560]   And I said, well, I can help you move them off the iPhone.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.800]   They're all on the other computer, which is the computer you sank with.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   You were sinked with?
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   >> You sank.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   >> You sank that computer.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.720]   >> Get the right out of the back.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   So they're all on the-
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.800]   >> Fortunately, we were able to get you a life raft and get you out of the water.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.760]   >> But he's got me to figure this out for him.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.760]   What is the consumer do?
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.960]   They go, well, I've got songs here, songs there, songs there.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960]   They download limewire.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   They download the songs.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.440]   >> Isn't that the idea of the new non-DRM iTunes songs now?
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.520]   >> Well, yes, except that the iPods still are tied to one machine.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   It's not still not-
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.000]   >> Well, to simplify it from my parents, I just got them to sink off of one machine.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   They sink both their iPods from one machine.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   >> Yeah, but he's a kid.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.920]   He's got a laptop and he's got a desktop and the desktop's downstairs.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920]   >> Oh, I see.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.920]   >> Look at the iPhone.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.920]   He's bought songs on the iPhone.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.920]   He's bought songs on the desktop.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920]   He wants it all on his laptop.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.840]   >> So in other words, because Leo Laporta's his dad, he has 72 computers in the laptop.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.080]   >> No, I don't think that's unusual.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.400]   A family computer, you might have your own computer in your room and you have your phone.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400]   You're right.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.000]   I mean, he's a little unusual, but for a 14-year-old, but it's not unusual for an 18 or 25-year-old.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.440]   >> What are you talking about by the time he's 15, I expect him to be piling in this
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   spaceship.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.160]   >> Well, I think this is the problem.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.320]   The music industry runs into is the younger crowd.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.720]   Like my parents, I taught them how to use iTunes a couple of weeks ago or whatever.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.680]   And now my dad, he had a little trouble getting it working on-
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.320]   >> That's the problem.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   >> As soon as he's using.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.480]   >> Well, he has a Windows machine and it was painful.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:38.960]   So anyway, once he got it working, he'll sit down and buy 25 songs in a sitting.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.600]   The price doesn't mean anything to him because he doesn't have any history with 99 cents.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.080]   And so 25 bucks is not a big deal for him.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.320]   >> No, but the problem that they're running into is-
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.960]   >> That's two CDs when you go to the store.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.560]   So it's like- >> Yeah, and the problem he-
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.160]   Well, and it's also- it's all the old singles that he liked in the '50s and '60s.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.160]   >> That's right.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.160]   I think it's worth it for him.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.040]   >> You couldn't even find those in a lot of the record stores anymore.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.120]   You can't find a record store anymore.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:06.520]   So the- but the problem is that what they're really dealing with is that 18 to 30 or the
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.520]   15 to 30.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.280]   What they need to do is they need to address this issue of non-portability from-
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.240]   I should be able to copy songs off my iPod.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.120]   Now that there's no DRM, shouldn't I be able to just move songs around at will?
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.040]   I mean, why do I have to have this- this is a little bit of a hangover from the old copy
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.200]   protection days, I think.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:29.440]   >> Well, you could still do that by just disabling syncing or other auto-syncing.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.040]   If you just simply uncheck that box.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.440]   >> No, but you guys have to get the stuff off the iPhone.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.920]   >> Okay, well- >> Hard to move music off the iPhone.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.840]   >> Six bucks, I mean- >> I know, I have the programs.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.040]   That's what I keep saying.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.080]   But meanwhile, he and his friends say just get lime wire and download the songs.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.400]   And once he's done that, then it's kind of, I keep trying to keep him from doing it.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   It's a slippery slope though.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   >> You paid the fine.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.880]   >> Yeah, once I pay the fine.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.640]   >> I got you $125 out of the music for $26,000, kid.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   >> That's what I tell him.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.760]   >> I don't think Leo Lepore is going to get away with the- I'm just an elderly woman.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.760]   I don't know.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.840]   >> I don't like this rap music.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.720]   What is this rap music?
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.640]   It's not my kind of music.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.240]   >> What is this new thing called the Internet?
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.680]   >> They call the pants up, follow the butt.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.120]   I don't get a big kiss with the clothes on that.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.240]   >> Your pants up you little whippers snapper.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.960]   I do say that to him all the time.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.960]   And get your haircut.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.960]   I sound like my father.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.800]   Actually, my father never said that.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.880]   I sound like somebody else's father.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.120]   >> Kind of like your grandfather.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.680]   Get your haircut and pull your pants up.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.400]   >> Of course, my grandfather, I used to wear my hair really long and my grandfather said
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.040]   eventually one of these days you're going to find that you like to have it really short.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.680]   And yeah, he was right.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   >> He was right.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.920]   >> I'm so you know what Mark Twain said.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.920]   I'm surprised.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.920]   >> He's like me looking at me now.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.480]   >> As I get older my dad gets smarter.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.400]   >> I'm surprised he didn't say you know your hair is going to get cut in a farm implement
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   one of these days.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.560]   >> I'm going to be sorry.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.200]   The cut by is going to rip your head off.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:24:00.640]   >> I finally got inspired to cut off my ponytail by an innocent week and a half ago when the
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.600]   director of the documentary Woodstock pulled on my ponytail and called me a damn filthy
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   hippie.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.800]   >> Ang Lee, did you cut it off?
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   >> No, no.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   >> No, this is it's it's it's it's.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   >> Oh, look at that.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.600]   >> I haven't cut it off.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.400]   No, no, it's tucked up underneath the head.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   >> Oh, it's unduploid.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   >> Unduploid.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   >> I'm not deployed.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   >> I'm not deployed.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400]   >> I'm not deployed.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.480]   >> Only deployed when I feel threatened.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.160]   Deploy the ponytail.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.440]   >> It's a way to signal to other Andy Nachos in the herd that there's a predator present
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.440]   in the future.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.680]   >> You know what would be really good is be have a kung fu movie where all the people
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   had Andy Nachos ponytails with like those little steel things in the end they whipped
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.680]   their head around and looked.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   >> That was really good.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.600]   >> And then we can do is we can record it on Skype so that the video and audio sync would
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.840]   be like it is right now and it looks like you're going.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   >> I got to go.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.840]   >> I got to go.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.840]   >> Godzilla.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.520]   >> It's him.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:05.240]   So Apple and Google are being scrutinized by the Department of Justice.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.400]   Now remember this is not not actually it's the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.080]   It's not a you know like an official investigation.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.200]   But they began an inquiry according to the New York Times on whether close ties between
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.520]   the boards of two of technologies most prominent companies Apple and Google amount to a violation
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.280]   of anti trust laws.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:30.600]   Of course Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive of Apple and Arthur Levinson, former Chief of
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.800]   Executive of Genentech is on both boards.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:41.320]   And the Clayton and Andy Truschtact of 1914 prohibits a person's presence on the board of
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.920]   two rival companies.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.480]   The question really is are Apple and Google rivals?
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.480]   If they're not.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   >> It's so complicated.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.920]   >> It is really complicated because yes they are in some ways but I think that they're
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.240]   more partners than rivals.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.080]   >> I think they're going to have a hard time applying the there's a thing called legislative
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.360]   intent when you look at things like the anti trust act.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:09.280]   And I do not believe given the climate at the time these laws were written that anybody
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.200]   even contemplated the current alliances we see now.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.080]   And therefore I don't believe they'll find that the legislative intent would cover a situation
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.640]   where you have someone working so closely together that they could be considered both
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.640]   partners and competitors because you know forgive me for using the word paradigm but
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.480]   it has shifted and everything's different.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480]   >> Right.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.080]   The term they use is interlocking directorates.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:39.920]   >> Yeah interlocking directorates though had a lot you know that had a lot bigger role
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:45.440]   to play when you had companies that were clearly purely competitive at the time that these
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.840]   statutes were written.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:52.200]   There was no such thing as the kind of alliances you see now between you know co-opetition let's
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   call it.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.200]   It didn't exist back then.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.040]   >> Well how would you collude if you're Apple and Google what would you collude to do?
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.480]   I mean they're really not in the same businesses.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.480]   I mean.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:07.440]   >> It's well you know the other thing is that the odd thing about anti trust laws is they
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.760]   apply until they don't.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.800]   I mean look at baseball.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.760]   Baseball has a permanent anti trust exemption but it realtors can't tell each other what
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.080]   they're selling a house for.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.080]   It's crazy.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.120]   It's one of those laws that had good intent but probably should go anyway.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.320]   >> So you say FTC investigation goes nowhere?
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   >> I don't believe so.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.160]   >> I mean the worst case scenario they don't have a lot.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.880]   >> The worst case scenario someone will have to resign from one of the boards.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.840]   >> Well and FTC doesn't have the kind of teeth that the Justice Department does.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.360]   >> I wonder if they would hand it off though.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.280]   >> Now they might but then the Justice Department has to start over and do their own investigation
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:47.320]   and they're going to apply the law probably somewhat differently than the Federal Trade
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   Commission.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.760]   I think this is more than likely comes from one of Google and or Apple's competitors
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.000]   trying to see if they can't create some heat so that they can sneak up behind.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.800]   >> And what?
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   Gussum?
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   >> Okay.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.760]   >> The equivalent of a goose in the business world.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   >> Well you know.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.760]   >> Well I mean think about it.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.400]   >> Or a super atomic wedgie.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.040]   >> If you can cause your a if you can cause your competitor to have to spend time and
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.680]   resources dealing with federal government that gives you time to spend the equal amount
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.680]   of time developing.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.680]   >> Right.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.240]   >> You know when you do have two interlocking directorates you got to turn the garden hose
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   on them.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:28.320]   >> Yeah you know that happened with that happened with my dog Sarge once and it was ugly.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.160]   >> Oh goodness gracious.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.680]   >> Him and this other dog a boxer named Madam got together and well you know they interlocked
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   for some time.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.880]   >> I want to interlock your directorate like an animal.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.840]   Speaking of Trent Reznor did you see.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   >> Sweet work.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.520]   >> That was good Leo.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.120]   >> That was a segue.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.920]   Closer which is the song I think that they're thinking of when they say apple says it's obscene.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.760]   >> Well there's actually a lot of songs.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.760]   >> On that album are they.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.440]   >> Well I don't know the album all that well I certainly know.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.720]   >> Well no but it's not iTunes it's the application.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720]   >> Right.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.760]   >> So nine inch nails.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.160]   Correct me I don't understand this exactly there's the albums downward spiral they already
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.120]   had one app that was approved that had that song on it.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.920]   >> No I think that I think that the I believe I could someone could correct me but I believe
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.400]   that situation is is that they weren't allowed to up they had downward spiral the whole album
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.960]   is is in iTunes is in the iTunes music store.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.840]   >> No has nothing to do with music it has to do with this iPhone app.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.200]   >> I know but then but I think that the argument was is that why are why is our songs why
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.440]   are songs available as music but but can't be available.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.720]   >> Well you don't think it's obscenity it's about it's about the fact that they're I don't
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.920]   think so because a lot of other artists are starting to do this this is actually a really
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.040]   cool way you know nine inch nails.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.960]   >> Is is in if you think that the issue is that they're trying to sell their album outside
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   of store.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.760]   >> No no no no it's it's that it's that there's a different there's a different what they're
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.840]   arguing is that there is a different standard for the music that goes into the iTunes music
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   store and the and what Apple is willing to approve as an app as an app and I think we
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.120]   talked about this last week I think Apple is much.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.600]   >> And it doesn't have much choice when it deals with music it just puts up with the record
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.040]   companies give it.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.000]   But it because it's you know that that's a very tenuous relationship no matter what
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.200]   but when they have full control over the apps they want to keep them clean now a lot of
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:25.800]   this looks like it's going to get washed up when the new iPhone 3o comes out when the
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:30.840]   OS 3o comes out and there's parental controls available it looks like Apple has been putting
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:35.440]   out putting out signals that people who have gotten who have been turned down via because
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:42.000]   of obscenities should or because that because of that type of thing should be should think
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.560]   about reapplying after the final controls go into a fight.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   >> Right they do say that when version three of the I from the I from the I from the I from
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.040]   that then they can then they can broaden their base.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.240]   >> This is what Apple wrote dear Craig Craig is the developer who wrote the nine inch nails
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   app.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.920]   >> Thank you for submitting nine inch nails access to the app store reviewed and in access
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.480]   and determined we cannot post this version of your iPhone app to the app store at this
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.560]   time because it contains objectionable content.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.080]   >> The injection content referred to in this emails the downward spiral since the app is
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.120]   live on the app store please make the necessary changes the application.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.120]   >> So in other words it got through.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.960]   >> Then they wanted to update it.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.320]   >> Version one is this is what the developer said version one is live version 1.03 got
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.720]   rejected due to content yet the app has no content in it.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.560]   It just streams a podcast down.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:41.160]   >> This is starting to become such a ball of pain for Apple to have to process all of
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   this content.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.040]   You think that maybe they're close to simply saying you know what we're going to subcontract
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.880]   this out to an outside company.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880]   >> Lame them.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:52.480]   >> Just so that we just exactly so we just want to set the guidelines have them follow
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.400]   guidelines not only would it allow them to have a little bit of coverage but also to it
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.720]   would force them to say here are the rules for processing iPhone apps and if you have
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.760]   a rule violation you want to be able to say you violated rule 11 which we made available
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.680]   to you when you applied for your license.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.560]   >> It's so weird because the application has been out.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.880]   It's a stability update it doesn't add any content.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.360]   They rejected the stability update and then they kind of retroactively said fix your other
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:26.520]   app because the app gets a podcast that contains the downward spiral so you can use the app
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.960]   to get content from 9 inch nail servers that has the downward spiral in it.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.200]   Now 9 inch nails has pulled the downward spiral out of the off their server so the app no
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.000]   longer can download that.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.080]   We'll see where their Apple now says okay.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:46.040]   What Trev, what Trev, Reznor says is look I just downloaded porn in email using your
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.840]   Apple mail program on my.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.040]   >> Not only that and it's in Safari isn't that but downwards.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:56.480]   >> Let's not forget that one of the features of 3.0 is going to be the best.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.640]   The ability for me to sell like an ebook reader software that allows you to buy other ebooks
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.560]   that I publish right from the application.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.440]   This problem is only going to get worse if they're going to have.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.560]   >> I think I can get Fannie Hill and Stanza can I?
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   I think I can.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.360]   >> I think this shows exactly why Apple stayed away from this stuff for a while.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.840]   >> Yeah but they're in it now.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.840]   They're in it.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.640]   >> I know but the thing is is that Andy's right.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.920]   I mean they jumped into a pile that's getting worse and worse and it's not they may change
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.520]   how they approach it because I think there's a lot of stuff you could do for instance as
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   a photographer.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:33.200]   I'd love to be able to sell photo books through a photography version of the iTunes store.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.080]   But I can imagine what would happen.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.320]   >> Well I think that if number one is the real head to head with this is that the fact
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.640]   that you can buy downward spiral on the iTunes music store.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.120]   >> But then they can market explicit and I mean that's the issue and so what I think
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.440]   what's going to happen is a lot of the throws out there are on downloads.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.320]   >> There are parental controls on downloads.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.960]   So I think that what Apple's doing is they're going to put the parental controls in and then
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.280]   and the reality is and we have to realize that if Apple had their druthers everything
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.040]   that you could run on a Mac would be PG, maybe PG-13.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040]   >> Really?
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   >> Really?
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   >> That's their preference?
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.720]   >> Absolutely.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.720]   And I think that the only reason that they let anything else through it I mean from the
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:20.240]   music and TV end of things is specifically because they don't have the leverage to control
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:25.000]   the entertainment industry or control the music and video labels but otherwise they would
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.440]   just be explicit it wouldn't exist.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.320]   >> They'd have no problems with clockwork orange being available for the iTunes store.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.480]   They do not want the stuff that airs on Cinemax after 2am to appear on the iTunes store.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.480]   >> Yeah that would be.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.880]   >> Boy they sure did make a lot of money though.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.440]   >> Do you really want to be in the business of Arbit of saying well that's clockwork orange
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   and that's you know.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.440]   >> But here's the thing why don't we have the conversations about Walmart?
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.240]   >> Well that's what Trent Reznor said this is Walmart.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.520]   Trent said you're pulling a Walmart on me.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.200]   >> Yeah because Trent said we wouldn't put our stuff in Walmart for that very reason.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.240]   >> Walmart pulls this kind of stuff day in and day out.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.520]   Walmart makes rap artists completely recut versions of their songs if they want them in
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.520]   Walmart's.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:12.760]   They take videos, they actually work with the videos that come in and have them take scenes
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.520]   out or won't carry them in Walmart.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.520]   It's crazy.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.320]   >> That kind of stuff is going on in other places so if we're going to have this conversation
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.800]   I think it's one to have.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   Let's have it.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.200]   >> Well I think that we also have everybody being involved.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   >> We also need to remember that in the tech industry and the fact that all of us are on
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:36.840]   the coasts there is a large country in between us that this is a big concern about the internet,
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:42.360]   about technology, about these other things and so there is a concern.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.520]   >> And I imagine parents are giving iPod touches to their kids.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:54.240]   >> But once this version three comes out and there is parental controls then it's on the
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   parents.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.880]   >> I think that Apple will loosen some of that up.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.560]   I don't think they're going to loosen it all the way but I think that they're definitely
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.320]   going to, I mean I don't think you're going to get porn available anytime soon on the
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.880]   app store.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.680]   But I think that you're going to, I think that going to rate it R with explicit controls
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.640]   and parental controls I think is probably something that we'll see more of.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.160]   >> All right, good.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.320]   >> We're going to take a break, come back with your picks, any other stories before we do
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.920]   that you guys feel are burning issues?
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.920]   We haven't covered yet?
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.800]   >> Well I do have an update Leo.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   >> Yes.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.840]   >> I just want to take a second to say our friend of the show, Leonily Huah.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.840]   >> Yes.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.440]   >> Is still struggling.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.040]   >> Oh no, what's going on?
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:43.560]   >> She's out of the hospital but she's, she's, she made her appearance at Macworld.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:50.880]   She'd come back from her pneumonia but she's still struggling here it is May and I just
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.920]   wanted everybody to give a shout out to her.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:59.120]   She's @fittorrent on Twitter and she's a friend of the show and she's, she's looking
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.000]   for some virtual technology hugs today.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.480]   I just wanted to update everybody because I do get a lot of questions about her.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.920]   She hasn't gone back to work yet.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.360]   She's, she's out of the hospital.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.360]   That's the good news.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.280]   >> Well that just, that just shows you how bad this stuff can be.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.600]   I mean, wow.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:21.160]   >> You know and she, she, she lost a little bit of weight and unlike me, she didn't need
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   to.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.800]   >> So I'm actually, I'm actually trying to give her some of mine but so far the transfer
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.560]   in test hasn't worked.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.480]   >> Well absolutely.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.480]   Boy we really, that's a shock to me.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.760]   Now I'm looking at her, at her Twitter stream.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.360]   It's clear that this is a very serious illness she's going through.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.560]   So we all wish you the best.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.600]   >> Thank you for allowing me to send that up.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.960]   >> Yeah, fittorrent, follow her on Twitter, F-I-T-T-O-R-R-E-N-T.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.960]   Wow.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.960]   >> Wow.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:59.160]   >> I mean it's, it's interesting who, we get all, we get all caught up in stuff like,
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.880]   well geez, they just announced a new MacBook Pro and I bought one yesterday and you know,
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.560]   there's a special perspective.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.560]   >> It is a personal perspective, doesn't it?
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.360]   >> The rest of the world has problems that are a little bit deeper.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:13.520]   You know, she's been sick for a long time and I've had health issues in my life and I
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.120]   know how quickly they can impact what you think about and what you think is important.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.320]   All right, all the best hugs to Williana from all of us.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.320]   >> Virtual hugs.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.320]   >> Virtual hugs going out.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.320]   >> Wow.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.040]   >> I think she wants Alex Tugger from there because he looks so much like Steve Jobs.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.040]   She can maybe get like that.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.040]   >> He's got the black turtleneck.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.040]   Are you wearing jeans?
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.040]   >> I am.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.000]   >> Oh my God, he's doing the jobs.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.360]   You know, it's the, what was clean this morning?
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.240]   >> I think the glasses are a little bit close as well, Alex.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.520]   I think those are similar to Steve Jobs' glasses.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.920]   >> I'm very excited.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.920]   >> This is like a humbling moment for Alex.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.760]   >> Are we here to talk to her?
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.760]   More management.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:59.440]   >> We're going to see pretty soon.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.320]   Annie's going to come out to a WWDC and cover it.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.000]   I'm hoping that Alex is not out of the country.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.200]   He's got a potential job that might take him out of the country, but if not, he'll be
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.400]   down there covering it.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.560]   Scott, are you going to come down for WWDC?
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.560]   >> I don't know.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.680]   You know, it's a little more on the technical side.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.600]   I'm usually a Mac world kind of guy.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:22.240]   I have done WWDC a couple of times, but usually it's a whole bunch of people walking
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.840]   around talking about things that completely baffle me.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.840]   So I don't know.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.840]   I may come down for-
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.360]   >> This year, I think it might be a little different.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.760]   >> I may come down for the party and, you know, maybe we can sneak in an unprecedented second
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.400]   day, visit to the house of Prime Rib.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.200]   >> Well, now you got me interested, Alex.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:52.840]   >> I was going to stay here and cover it from far, but maybe now you've got beef.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.600]   >> I just added an out of my packing list, the Ziploc baggies.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.920]   They're really good, like eight-
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   >> Big ones.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.880]   Big Ziploc baggies.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.160]   Yeah, so when is it?
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.160]   >> June, right?
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.160]   >> Yeah, but June 9th, I think.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   June 8th.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.160]   That's the keynote.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.240]   I might as well go through this.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.520]   We'll be going through it again for the next three episodes.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.480]   Prognostications, Andy Inako, any thoughts?
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:22.280]   >> Well, obviously we're looking for the next big device that runs that Touch OS.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.040]   They need to show the rest of their cards for Snow Leopard.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.360]   If architecture is really all they're giving us, then they have to make that plane during
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.360]   WWDC.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.120]   I don't think it'll be quite as earth-shattering as we're all hoping it's going to be.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:40.080]   But it'll definitely let us know that late 2009 or early 2010 are going to be good times
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.360]   to not to be big fans of electricity and things that recharge from electricity, let's
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.360]   say.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.120]   >> I do wonder if we might not see Snow Leopard at the show, like released at the show.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.160]   Well, they have to.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   How could they not mention this, go through it at WWDC?
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.040]   Not give the big two-hour long song and dance, but at least say, "Here are the features.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.560]   Here's where we're going to be deploying this."
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.280]   And here is the last, a Golden Master candidate, or at least here's something very, very close
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   to it.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.680]   Now, go forth to love and serve the jobs.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.880]   I don't think they can get away with that unless they're going to say that, "Well, let's
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.440]   look at 2010 for Snow Leopard because no one's really excited about it and we can put more
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.640]   cool things under the hood after we release the cool things that we're going to be doing
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.640]   in the fall."
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.400]   >> Oh, you think it might do that?
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.400]   >> Maybe.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.920]   I think that's the only way they can avoid not doing something big with Snow Leopard.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.720]   >> Aren't they ramping up though the release candidates?
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.880]   I mean, aren't they getting close to release?
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   >> They're not going to release it.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.880]   >> They're not going to release it.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880]   I don't think so.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.840]   >> I don't think they're going to release it at WWDC, but again, they have to essentially
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.120]   give us a date or give us wallets.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.680]   The last release candidates have looked very, very good.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:50.160]   Obviously, release of betas is accelerating, so let's just say mid-August or late August,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.000]   and that's when you can prepare to start shipping.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.440]   That's when we're going to be start shipping machines that have 10.6 pre-installed.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.440]   They have to do something.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.880]   >> I agree with that.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.520]   I think that, but yeah, I don't think they're going to.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.120]   I think they're going to show us lots of cool stuff.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.160]   We didn't talk about it.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:08.280]   I think we're going to see a media pad or something like it.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   But I agree with Andy.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   I don't think we're going to.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.000]   >> I hope it's not a big bust.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.240]   We get all excited about it.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:16.440]   >> I think we're going to see the new iPhone.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.080]   >> What will that look like?
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.840]   >> The new iPhone.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.160]   >> With version 3 software?
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   It's got to be more--
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.040]   >> Yeah, they'll throw in a couple of new--
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.800]   >> It's going to have more than that.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.680]   It's not really-- I'm going to get 3.0 on my 3G.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.320]   You're going to have to add some hardware features.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.480]   >> Well, I'm not sure if we're going to see hardware features.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:40.040]   More like the same features that are built in will work better.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.120]   Like we're going to need some more room from the graphics processor.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.160]   >> More power.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:50.000]   >> I think they're going to be features in the OS and features in the user applications
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.360]   sphere that are going to require beefed up hardware.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.040]   So we're going to see a big processing bump.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.200]   We're going to see a big storage bump.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:00.160]   Adding video capability, though, is not sufficient, I don't think, to make this thing a--
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.600]   >> No, 4G, maybe.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.200]   >> 4G isn't available, though.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.120]   I mean, let's face it, AT&T barely has 3G.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.120]   >> We'll talk about it.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:09.720]   >> All right.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.360]   >> Oh, chat about it.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:10.840]   >> All right.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.840]   It's 4G capable.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.240]   >> It'll be 80211N.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:14.760]   >> Right.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.720]   >> You know, that was out forever.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.600]   It was capable.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.280]   >> Could do it.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.680]   Draft standard.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.680]   >> When you dock it to your MacBook Pro, it is capable of capturing 7.20 video.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.240]   >> I'm going to take a break and come back with your picks, ladies.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.200]   And-- well, wait a minute, there's no ladies here.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:29.960]   >> Unless you include me.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.960]   >> Did we get a new guest?
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.960]   >> No, no.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.840]   Gentlemen, I will come back and get your picks of the week.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.800]   But right now, it's time for my pick of the week, audible.com.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   Audible is our sponsor.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.720]   They keep us on the air.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.440]   And we thank them for doing so.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:47.280]   We invite you to give them a try at audible.com/macbreak.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.880]   Great selection of audio entertainment for you.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.400]   I don't say just books because Audible is really much more than just books.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.680]   Audible includes-- well, I'm going to download some Chinese lessons.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.720]   Andy, you might want to do the same from Audible.com.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:05.760]   They also include comedy performances, radio shows, magazines, newspapers.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.280]   It's a whole host of audio entertainment.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.640]   Just really a wonderful place to listen.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:18.000]   I'm getting ready for the China trip that Andy and I and Don McAllister are going on.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.560]   MacMania 9.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.840]   By listening to books about China.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:28.280]   Right now, I'm listening to Empress Orchid, which is the story of the last Empress of China.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.040]   It's just great.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.960]   Really gets you in the mood.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.200]   And of course, it all takes place in the Forbidden City.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.560]   And so we're going to get to see that.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:41.360]   So I'm very excited about getting inside the city that until the last hundred years, nobody
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.080]   except the emperor and his minions could enter.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.720]   That's why it was forbidden.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:53.360]   And of course, as I travel, I will bring Audible with me because it goes on my iPhone, my iPod.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.440]   You could put it on a Zoom, a Kindle, virtually any hardware device these days.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   Go look at the device center.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.880]   You'll see hundreds of different devices.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.120]   You could put these audiobooks on and listen to.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.360]   And so I always when I travel for the airplane and even when I'm traveling around, I remember
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.400]   when I was in Egypt, Steve Levine of the Levenger catalog was listening.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.800]   And I said, what are you listening to?
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.000]   He says, Audible, I'm listening to books about Egypt while I walk through the pyramids.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   What fun.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   What fun.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.720]   When you're commuting, when you're in the gym, when you're in the garden, Audible is my constant
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.280]   companion and it could be yours.
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.280]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.760]   First book is free when you sign up for the gold account.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.160]   Andy, what are you listening to these days?
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.600]   Actually, I don't recommend a book that I've been reading on my iPhone.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.440]   I'm three chapters into Merrell Marko's.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:41.800]   Not her most recent, but her second most recent book, Knows Down Eyes Up a Novel.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.280]   Merrell Marko is the name that will be familiar to a lot of people who are fans of comedy.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:51.680]   She was one of the co-creators of David Letterman's entire show format.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.280]   And she is this really great comic novelist that does things that you don't think anybody
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.280]   else could really get away with.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:04.640]   This is the story of a 40-something-year-old handyman who has three or four dogs.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:10.440]   And when he starts dating an animal psychologist or an animal communicator, he starts to be
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.520]   able to simply understand what they're saying to each other.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.880]   And so he starts having really nice conversations with his dog and will pause five seconds for
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.520]   you to roll for people to roll their eyes and say, "I really don't.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.520]   Oh, great.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   I talked to his friends.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.680]   We hear all kinds of cute dog stories.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.680]   We'll know."
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.480]   It really is a great comedy.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.520]   I mean, one of the dogs is a rescue dog, a shelter dog, and starts everything with "I'm
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.320]   sorry" and ends with "Don't Hurt Me."
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:42.360]   Every time I'm not going to hit you, I just want to know where, "Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.360]   I don't know where he went.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.360]   Don't hit me.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.360]   I think this way.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.360]   Don't hit me."
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.920]   You know, it's true if dogs could talk.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.440]   That's some of them would say that.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.080]   That's not just a one-joke novel.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.720]   Basically, it's him trying to...
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.120]   The owner is trying to grow up a little bit.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:04.600]   And when the alpha dog in his little clatch of dogs wants to meet his real mother, unfortunately,
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.240]   he knows that his real mother is owned by his ex-wife.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.880]   And so he now has to go and basically talk to her a lot.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.880]   Like I said, I'm only about three or four chapters in, but it's the sort of thing where
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:20.000]   it's almost the story almost doesn't matter because the actual text itself is line-by-line
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.040]   paragraph-by-paragraph so entertaining.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:29.320]   And you love to see an author take such risks and do things that if you just read this as
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:34.480]   an untouched cover blurb on the back, you'd put this right back on the shelf at Barnes
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.480]   and Noble and keep on moving on.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:40.440]   But it is so well done that I'm really enjoying it.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:44.520]   The best recommendation sometimes I can give for a book is when I read these things on Kindle
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.000]   and I download the free first chapter and not really just want something quick that I can
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.360]   read without having to pay for it.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.600]   And then I'm like, "Damn it, I have to read that."
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.600]   Now I have to buy it.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.600]   Now I have to buy it.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   Let me play a little bit.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.240]   This is David Drummond reading from "Nosedown Eyes Up a Novel" by Merrill Marco, our Audible
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.240]   Pick of the Week.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:07.000]   And I had ever been to see anyone, even though he'd been sitting there for hours on end and
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.520]   had seen me and seen me and seen me and seen me some more, I would be reminded how much
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.960]   I liked his company.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:22.480]   Jimmy was the only guy I knew who could change my mood for the better just by showing up.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.480]   Jimmy is the dog.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.320]   You know how people say you end up looking like your dog?
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.080]   That was probably true of me and Jimmy.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:34.840]   We were both in good shape for middle-aged guys, big and beefy, meaty, but not fat.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.440]   I'm not a fan of this genre, but you know what?
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.680]   That sounds pretty cute.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:41.640]   And knowing that Merrill Marco, who's got a little bit of edge to her, wrote it.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.200]   That'll help.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   That'll help.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.200]   "Nosedown Eyes Up."
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.520]   You know, this could be your first book, but there's 51,000 titles to choose from.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.320]   From Marley and Me to "Nosedown Eyes Up."
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.080]   They're all dog books all the time.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.520]   No, go to audible.com/macbreak and browse around.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.880]   I think you'll find something for everyone and a free book too.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.880]   We thank them so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:06.720]   All right, I'm going to step back because I have a few picks, but I know that I have
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:11.080]   a feeling by the end of this show you will all have picked my picks.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.960]   So I'm going to start with Alex Lindsey and see what he's got up his sleeve.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.960]   What is your pick of the week, Alex?
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.960]   I got two picks.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.040]   See, I knew right away.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.040]   I'm doubling up.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.040]   All right.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.240]   That makes it twice as likely that I won't have a pick by the end of the show.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.240]   Go ahead.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.920]   My first pick is actually a little iPhone app, and this was actually suggested.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:33.920]   I was sent to me via Twitter, an iPhone developer for Tantrum apps, and it's called ZooSounds.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:39.040]   Now, the reason that I'm picking this is that my son is obsessed with my iPhone.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.040]   It's my 17--
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.040]   Oh, it says, ooh.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.640]   Well, it's just, you know, you have these little-- you have these little things.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:44.880]   Hold on, there we go.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:49.000]   You have these little images that kids can play.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.080]   And this is really designed for kids one through three.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.080]   Now, the fact that you're--
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.080]   Oh, I had to talk about it.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.080]   I had to talk about it.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.080]   Actually.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   Is it a 10-year-old play with your iPhone?
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.760]   Wait, hold on.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.960]   It's probably muted, yeah.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.000]   That's a cat.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   Right?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Am I right?
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   No, you could be loved.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Oh, that's fun.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.800]   And then they can push that.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.840]   And then, does Malachi say cat?
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.240]   I mean, he's working on it.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.240]   He's mostly just like--
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.240]   He just likes to say.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.240]   What I love is the idea.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.240]   What I'm doing.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.880]   I'm planning to buy him in the next week or two.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.320]   I'm going to buy him a touch.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.320]   You know, he doesn't even know.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   Whoa, no.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.320]   I want to call him.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.320]   How old is he?
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.320]   He's 17 months.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   You're going to buy him his own iPod touch.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.040]   Yeah, well, the thing is, is that I've realized that he loves--
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:35.280]   I mean, just loves our iPhones.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   My wife and I both have iPhones.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.200]   And when he were in the car, was he playing with it?
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   Well, I don't want to play with it in the market.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.440]   When he gets tired of something, he throws it.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.080]   You know, he just goes, OK, I'm done.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.720]   And the problem is that we laugh.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.360]   We made the mistake of laughing when he throws.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.040]   I thought I was going to say you don't want it to be a distraction for him all these driving.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.400]   Alex pushes his kids a little.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.400]   We don't want to say too much.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:58.920]   No, well, the thing is, we made the mistake of laughing when he throws things over his
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:50:59.920]   shoulder.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.920]   He has some flippant way of throwing things over his shoulder.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.320]   It's hard to laugh at that.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.760]   So he looks at you and he just goes, yeah.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.440]   And when it's your iPhone, you're very sad.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   So anyway, so my plan is to get him a touch and then ruggedize it, so it can really handle
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.440]   something.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.840]   And then the idea is, when he's in the car, he can kind of play with some of these abs.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.360]   He's going to be a brilliant little kid because he's going to be like already, you know--
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.360]   We're going to limit it.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:25.800]   Just for those people who are listening and are thinking, we're taking it way down a
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.520]   bad path here.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.800]   We're going to limit the amount of time he's using the iPhone.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.800]   It's not like he gets to play with it all day or the touch.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.640]   But I think that there's a lot of ways for him to interact with that data.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.920]   Right now, we have him watching DVDs on how to read and--
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.080]   I sent him for an episode.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:48.120]   And because your kid can read or your baby can read DVDs that my wife got and she loves
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.360]   him and he likes them.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:55.040]   And so the idea is to-- What I'm excited about is the idea of making these applications for
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.480]   kids that are one to three.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.320]   There's a lot of interactive stuff that can be put together that I'm excited about.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.200]   So anyway, that's tantrum apps and zoo sounds.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.600]   And of course, it's only 99 cents.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.240]   Now my second one is a little bit more pro.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:15.440]   And that is this-- When I'm on the road, often, and I'm trying to link into do the
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.640]   show, I'm oftentimes looking for a mic interface.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:23.000]   A way to get good microphones, good XLR microphones.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.800]   And I had a sentence which died.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.840]   It's just a little too much travel.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:27.840]   I was recommending that.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.480]   And we use it for a number of people.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.320]   And I carried around everywhere and it just slowly fell apart.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.520]   And so I was really looking for something a little bit more solid, a little bit-- just
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:42.080]   a little bit built to a slightly higher structural standard.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:46.520]   And I'm sure has just come out with what's called the X2U.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.200]   This pretty much has most of the same features.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.480]   You have a mic gain.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.400]   So you can change your mic levels.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.400]   You have the volume.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.800]   The volume is your headphone volume.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:03.880]   You have a monitor which mixes the output of your computer and your vocals.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.560]   And it also does 48 volts.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.560]   You can plug it in.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.560]   It's just interesting.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.040]   You have a send mix.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.040]   You can listen.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.040]   You have that with the mix as well.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.040]   Being able to mix it.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:17.920]   It's just USB so you have that you can put it up there if you want.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.920]   I got it on.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.320]   What's great is that you can just plug that into the end of a mic.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.080]   It comes with a very long USB cable.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:30.160]   So you can simply plug that into the end of a microphone without an XLR cable.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:34.320]   And then just simply take an XLR along the on-long XLR cable that comes with it.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.320]   And use that as the mic.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   You can use almost as a mic stand.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.240]   And then use the USB cable.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:45.080]   And so it's a great little piece of...
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.800]   Right now it's only shipping with the SM58.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.800]   It's a little bundle.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:49.960]   But that's a good bundle.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:54.400]   And we just sent one to Brian Stelter at New York Times for this week in media.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.400]   I think that's a good bundle to sell.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.640]   And it turned out really well.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.400]   I think that's an excellent mic.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.640]   A very pro good quality mic, but not very expensive and very robust.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:05.280]   Well, and the other thing that's great about the SM58 is that you can really...
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.480]   If people lean up into it, you're not going to get a lot of surround sound.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.800]   They don't have a good studio like many other...
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.160]   So there's a converter inside that?
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.760]   Yeah, that converts from the XLR to USB.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.760]   So you just plug it into the...
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:19.760]   It'll show up automatically.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760]   There's no drive or phone.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.760]   It's also got fan and power.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.680]   It's interesting they sell it with the SM58, which doesn't need fan and power because it
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.680]   has fan and power.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.680]   But this has fan and power.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.680]   So you can plug it into...
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.320]   You can use your countrymen if you want.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.880]   And what's the retail price?
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.880]   I believe it's like one...
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.880]   I want to say 129.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.880]   I think it's more than that.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   It might be.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.880]   But the bundle is 199 on Amazon.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:38.880]   Yeah, the bundle is 200.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.680]   So that's about right.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.080]   Because it's about 120 bucks for a SM58.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.080]   Right.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.080]   If you just buy it by itself.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.280]   So that's actually a very good deal.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.280]   Freaking outstanding.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.280]   Yeah, that's an excellent...
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:52.200]   And what's great is that you can get some pretty good USB mics.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.800]   But what's great about this is that once you buy this converter, you can plug it into
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.880]   any mic you want.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:59.280]   Any pro mic that you want is all...
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   They're all going to have XLR outs.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.200]   And you're going to be able to just plug them right in rather than only having the USB
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.640]   mic that you bought.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.840]   And one of them fancy German Newman mics.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.240]   No, even one of them.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.240]   You get one in...
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.240]   You get one in...
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.240]   You get one in...
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.240]   ...knowing in...
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.240]   ...knowing in...
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.240]   ...knowing in mics and you can do whatever you want.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   This is cool.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.240]   We...
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.240]   I got it.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.240]   We used this...
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.240]   I got it.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.240]   ...the entrance for a long time.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   And I think this is a worthy successor, especially in a package with the SM58.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   Exactly.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   Somebody sent me the Amazon link.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   I want to buy one right now.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   I think we would send this.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:35.920]   You know, we were sending out his FastTrack USB devices from Maudio along with the PR40s.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.320]   Well, that's pretty expensive.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.680]   That's about a $500 package.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:39.960]   So this is going to save us a lot of money.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.080]   Buy itself is $129 on Amazon.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.640]   Well, they do sell it standalone now.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.640]   And it's supposed to be...
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.640]   I don't know if it's...
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   But I would get it with the SM58.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.280]   The SM58 bundle is a great bundle.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.280]   That's a great deal.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.280]   It is...
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.320]   It's still a little back ordered to buy it by itself, but if you buy it with the SM58,
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.320]   which is...
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   That's what we're now doing.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.320]   It worked out so well.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.760]   When we're going to be sending out to a lot of our hosts, the SM58 and this as the bundle.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.760]   Awesome.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   To clean things up.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.760]   So anyway, those are my picks.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   Thank you, Andy.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   You're welcome.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.280]   I'm looking at myself and trying to figure out...
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:16.640]   It looks such a wonderful little solution for so many different problems.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.800]   My own microphone is...
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   I like it a lot.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.520]   What do you use?
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.080]   I use an Maudio.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:26.800]   It's called the producer USB, which I like because not only is it a really nice microphone,
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:32.120]   but also it has built in headphone jack right on the front there.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.360]   So there's no delay.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.680]   And also there's nothing, the cord snaking around to the back of the computer and then
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.680]   getting tangled up.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.200]   It's all like in one simple head.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.200]   That's important.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.160]   People don't realize I think that there is latency.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.040]   If you listen on your computer, you will hear...
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.040]   It'll be delayed.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.040]   It's very important.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:53.680]   If you buy one of these USB mics or you buy a converter like this, it's very important
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:56.080]   that the headphone is built into the converter or the mic.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.040]   Are you going for yourself for real?
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.040]   You go crazy.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.200]   You'll literally hear voices in your head and most of them won't like it.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.840]   Well, Scott, Borne, you're champing at the bit I can tell.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.040]   You get going now, sir.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.560]   What is your pick of the week?
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:15.080]   Well, you know, I have an iPhone app, which I don't pick many iPhone apps, but I like this
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:19.520]   one because I use it as a photographer and it's amongst the cheapest all ever pick.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:24.040]   It's a buck 99 and it's called darkness.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.760]   And now before you jump to conclusions...
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.320]   It's very depressing.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.000]   No, it is very enlightening.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.720]   Now, if you're a person who's a wildlife photographer like me and you want to figure out exactly
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:41.440]   when dawn is, exactly when dusk is, exactly when the moon's rising, et cetera, this is
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.520]   your app.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:48.320]   It'll use the location-based services in the iPhone so that you can say, "I'm at my current
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.320]   location.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.320]   What's the deal?"
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.960]   And then all of a sudden, it tells you exactly when the sunrise is.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:59.720]   It gives you the angle the sun, tells you when exact moon is, sunset, moonrise, moon
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:05.840]   sunset, and you can also get this information from any number of other cities if you need
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.240]   to compare.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:12.520]   But this simple little thing, it's one of those things where for nature and wildlife
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:16.280]   photographers that spend a lot of time trying to figure out exactly when sunrise and sunset
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.120]   is, which is important because that's what the good light is.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.160]   It's just like, "Boom, I don't have to go through a bunch of hoops.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   I can hit a couple of buttons and know, "Okay, it's exactly 618."
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:29.520]   So that means I have to get up by four o'clock to leave the hotel to get to my location.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.520]   Very cool.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:31.520]   Darkness.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.520]   It's from a place called B-J-A-N-G-O, "Bajango."
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.080]   "Bajango."
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.320]   And it's got, it's even available in numerous languages like English, French, German,
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.960]   Italian, Swedish, Jewish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.960]   I apologize.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.920]   I have a strange form of Tourette's called "commercial Tourette's."
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.160]   Whenever I hear a commercial name, I really like, I have to shout it out.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.160]   "Bajango."
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.160]   "Bajango."
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.160]   "Okay, some about that."
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.680]   There's 20,000 cities already programmed in like...
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   Wow.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:03.680]   Including Petaluma, California.
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:04.680]   Really?
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:07.080]   Yeah, it's in there.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:09.240]   Hey, that's where I live.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.000]   I'll know when the sun sets now.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.040]   We use this a lot in film sets as you really need to know.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.040]   You need it out.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.040]   On every call sheet.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.040]   I'm losing the light here.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.040]   It says so on my iPhone.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:21.960]   On every call sheet that we get in the morning, like when we're shooting, it says, "When sun
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.960]   set it..."
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:23.960]   You know, "Sunrise sunset."
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.960]   Like, this is when we're...
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.760]   So it's important when you're managing all the stuff.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.760]   So it's a great application.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:34.360]   I'm glad I don't have a job where I have to worry about sunrise and sunset times.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.920]   It just sounds like hard work.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.000]   Annie and Iko, your turn, my friend.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.080]   I'm very much in tune to sunrise because that means that, "Ooh, I should probably wrap
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.080]   up, wrap things up and go to bed."
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.080]   Go to bed.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.520]   Yeah, when the sun comes up, Annie gets back in his coffin.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:53.880]   It's like, "And then I remember, oh no, I've got an editor in the UK who's expecting
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.480]   something and she's going to be in her office in 30 minutes."
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.480]   Oh, damn it.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.440]   Anyway, there are times when you like to recommend things that people have never heard
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.360]   of and then there are times when you like to recommend things they've probably heard
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.200]   of but have never been motivated to purchase before.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.320]   I've had a Roku box in my house for months now.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.880]   I got it for review.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.120]   You set it up and used it for a couple of weeks, I think, for the purposes of review,
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.800]   but it never actually left my office.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.840]   But just a couple of weeks ago, I finally took the time to really like reassemble my home
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.800]   video stuff and finally plugged into the big screen TV.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.280]   And now I am the biggest fan ever of Roku.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.800]   I gave it a positive review at the time because it is a great little box.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:39.200]   What it is is it's a very simple, very boring little black box that costs just 99 bucks
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.680]   but it has what it does is it will stream video from Netflix's streaming service and
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:49.520]   Amazon's streaming video service and future streaming video services because it's completely
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:53.840]   downloaded downloads updates as updates are pushed.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.560]   And that's really about it.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.600]   For 99 bucks, you get access to tens of thousands of movies at a really, really great price.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:06.440]   I'm already a Netflix subscriber, so access to their library technically was free.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.000]   If you just want to sign up for Netflix just to get access to this huge on-demand video
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.840]   library, it can cost you as little as nine bucks a month.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.480]   And you can still get videos from them, but just nine bucks a month will give you unlimited
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   access to this service.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.840]   Just last night, I was watching the tail end of a movie on Turner Classic movies and I
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.280]   decided, "Oh geez, I should add this to my Netflix queue."
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:34.440]   What you do is you go onto any web browser via Netflix, you just simply add movies that
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.640]   are available on demand.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.240]   You can simply add it to a queue.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.320]   And then instantly when you pick up the remote for the Roku box, this sort of a cover flow
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.640]   sort of movie poster interface, let's do flip through all of these movies that you've added
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.800]   to your queue.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:53.160]   And it really shows you the power of having a subscription based model as opposed to a
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.800]   buy as you go model, where I found the one movie that I wanted, and Netflix's site is
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.200]   really excellent at finding movies that are sort of similar.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.800]   Also movies that are recommended for you based on your previous movie rating.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.440]   So I selected Rio Grande and then it selected a whole bunch of other westerns, two or three
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.960]   of which that I've been meaning to see, so add, add, add.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.840]   And then I started thinking about, "Oh well, go in south of them, Jack Nicholson.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.880]   What are other Jacknits and movies?
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   Add, add, add.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.200]   Oh, they've got all the seasons of the office, both the US and the UK versions.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   Add, add, add, add.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.520]   All every episode of my Python.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.760]   Oh, add that, add, add, add, add, add that.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:32.120]   And just after 20 minutes of browsing, now I have 110, 120 movies lined up to be watched
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.120]   on my Roku.
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:40.000]   I was watching the second evening with Kevin Smith documentary right before the show.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.880]   I wish that every single device that streams video and works on the internet could be as
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.800]   easy to set up as the Roku box.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.240]   There are a couple other boxes that I've been trying out that I'm not finished messing
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.600]   around with them, so I won't name them, that it just borks at the stage of trying to find
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.920]   a connection to the internet.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.160]   Or it needs a special password and the website and the box are not communicating well.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.320]   Roku, one, two, three, and I was suddenly watching movies.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.240]   For 99 bucks, good happens.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.760]   It's the biggest no-brainer that you could ever have.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.560]   Sometimes it would be nice if it were in a bigger fan, so your box.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.480]   It would be nice if it could stream music from iTunes library, but I appreciate and respect
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.520]   the fact that I think that the number one thing that they had on the whiteboard when
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.200]   they were designing the Roku is $99.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:29.960]   And then every time a clever guy would say, "Oh, well, you know what?
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.960]   If we put in this extra chip, we would have the stream, will it allow us to still sell
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.960]   for $99?"
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.920]   Well, no, we can have to sell for $102.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920]   No.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920]   90.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   Snippet $9.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.920]   Snippet $9.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.280]   Does it have Wi-Fi?
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.120]   It'll also work by a copper, so you don't need to run copper all the way to your TV to make
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.120]   it work.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:56.760]   And, again, setting it up through a secure network was, again, let's choose choose from
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.000]   the different networks you have.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   Cool.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   What's your password?
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   Cool.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   Done.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   I'm on.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   And is it good enough?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.160]   I mean, how does it handle if you have slower bandwidth or if you're on Wi-Fi, does the player
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.320]   automatically step the quality down or do you see more buffering?
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.560]   What happens there?
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.640]   There is a stream in HD if that movie is available in HD.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.480]   I was watching Kevin Smith in high definition.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.640]   And when you started up, there was a--
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.280]   Is it on Wi-Fi or you are hard watching?
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.280]   I'm on Wi-Fi.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280]   Oh, cool.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.440]   So that's the one place I haven't bought.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.040]   Basically, this is a lifestyle that I lead.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.480]   The network bridge that's next to my TV that does nothing but serve things or to turn
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.280]   my TV is full up.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.680]   I need to expand to an eight port.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   Eight port bridge.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.680]   Wow.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.880]   But even via Wi-Fi.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.640]   It takes about-- there's like maybe an eight or nine second delay, maybe 20 second delay
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.960]   as it buffers just at the start.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.360]   After that, you're getting-- I haven't put a meter on this, but it looks like standard
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.560]   720p HD video.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.760]   No stuttering, no blocking, no buffering, no nothing.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.000]   It's just perfectly smooth video.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   You can pause it.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   You can fast forward.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   You can rewind it.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.200]   Or you can abandon it in the middle and go back.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.360]   And the interesting thing is this isn't a feature of Roku.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.480]   This is a feature of how Netflix does things.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:15.360]   You get the impression that they're getting a couple complaints about a certain title because
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.000]   I will be in the living room and I will be watching a movie.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.600]   And then, oh, geez, I really need to get back to work.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   Push pause on it.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600]   Go downstairs to the office.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:29.560]   And by the time I get downstairs to the office, there's an automated email from Netflix saying,
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.760]   why would you rate the video quality of this movie?
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.320]   How do you like that?
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   Was that good?
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.880]   Was it good for you?
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.440]   That's like a nagging girlfriend.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.280]   So, really, was it good for you?
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.360]   And so, we're talking about tens of thousands of titles.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.080]   I'm disappointed that I couldn't get any "Chocolatey" movies because I really, I saw
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.520]   the first half of "Mon Uncle" a few, a couple months ago.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:56.400]   I never got around to seeing the end of it and I still don't know how that movie ends.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.160]   But you're still dealing with tens of thousands of movies.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.640]   I think Netflix has close to 25,000 titles available by streaming.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.160]   Amazon adds another 30 or 40, I think.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:13.000]   So, there's, like I said, nine bucks a month for chiefly, pretty much as many movies as
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.240]   you could possibly consume in that month.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.240]   That's a good value.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.200]   Again, 99 bucks, that's exactly the best feature of this box.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.400]   The fact that it works well is just icing on the cake.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.400]   Very good.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.920]   The show is so expensive for me.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   I know.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   You want to sit around?
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   Like, you just ordered it.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   I just ordered it.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.920]   It's tempting.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.920]   I already just, I just ordered the converter from Amazon.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.880]   So, we, we, you know, I almost ordered it.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.120]   But, you know, I'm worried because my Wi-Fi, I just feel like I can't.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.240]   You know, it's very frustrating.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:42.120]   There's nothing worse than sitting and watching a movie and having it, you know, buffer and
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.120]   stuff.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.120]   And my Apple TV, you know, sometimes-
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.040]   Well, my, my, where my Apple TV is and everything else is right next to all of that stuff is
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040]   all in one place.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.320]   I should say, I would all buy the ethernet as well as an Apple.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.320]   That would require rewiring the house.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.320]   Crazy talk.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.320]   Crazy talk.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   All right.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.280]   Well, you said it does a good job with a, with a Wi-Fi.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.280]   I'm going to try it.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.040]   And that, and that's with an airport extreme or?
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.600]   I've got a hooked up to an airport extreme.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.080]   I did have it when I was, had it in the office, I had it hooked up by a copper.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.680]   I'll tell you that I really can't tell the difference in the video quality and the experience
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.160]   between copper and Wi-Fi.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.480]   Because that would be great.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:19.360]   If the Wi-Fi were reliable and consistent, that would sure save me.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.360]   All right.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.880]   Roku, R-O-K-U Labs, L-A-B-S dot com.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:28.040]   And it's pretty much subsumed their entire product line.
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.880]   The all the other stuff is like a back pages now.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   It's on.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.880]   This is it.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:32.880]   This is the front page.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.880]   This is it.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.480]   It's like a saxophone player for the Beatles.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.120]   You know, they kept him on the payroll, but he had a real voice that.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.120]   I have really got much chance.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.120]   My time has passed.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.120]   Well, I have something that's not going to cost you too much.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.120]   Actually, I have two things.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.520]   I wanted to mention that Bento now has an iPhone app.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.520]   I was going to pick that.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.200]   And I decided to let you pick it.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.200]   You liar.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.040]   It was actually, I thought Andy might pick it because Andy was the one who was singing
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.080]   The Praises of Bento so highly.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.520]   A few episodes of back, I think.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:07:59.520]   Right.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.520]   I'll tell you.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.520]   I might even know.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.520]   I don't, I don't want to torpedo your pick.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:07.760]   I'm saying that I, this underscores why I think that the app store needs a total revamp and
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.120]   how they organize things unless most of the most of the cool apps that I find out about
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:16.760]   for the apps from the app store, I find about find out about either people recommending
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:23.200]   them to me or through press releases because I just do not have the energy in this frail,
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.960]   mortal body to simply look through the app store for cool stuff.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.960]   Oh, I know what you mean.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   I know.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.960]   There's too much stuff.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:33.400]   I have apps trying to figure out which one of them is worth the one half of the money
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   they're charging for.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.400]   Well, I got the press release.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.840]   Kevin Malin sent me a press release, but that's why we hope people will listen to this show
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840]   because we try to highlight.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.320]   I mean, there's 35,000 apps.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.080]   We're not going to highlight them all, but we try to highlight stuff that's.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.080]   We are indispensable.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.600]   Give yourselves to us.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.600]   Even for each other.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.600]   We're indispensable.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.600]   Exactly.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.120]   So if you use Bento, this is, you know, this is, there's a whole series.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   Shovebox has a app to for the iPhone.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.520]   They sync up with the desktop.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.720]   I don't know what I presume the Bento uses Wi-Fi to sync.
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.960]   Nobody that I know of is really using mobile me to sync.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.920]   And I guess that's more telling about mobile me than anything else.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.920]   I wish they did.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.160]   More people did use mobile me to sync, but that's not my pick, though, actually.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.760]   So you wouldn't have undermined it.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.520]   My pick is the largest iPhone application in history.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:21.200]   It is a 727 megabyte download.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.480]   It will take a gig and a half on your largest, you know, Wikipedia is larger.
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:25.480]   How big is Wikipedia?
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.480]   It's like a, it's a gig.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:29.800]   The app itself is just a handful of bytes, though.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800]   Right.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.800]   The app, you're right.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.800]   It's all data.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800]   That's right.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.800]   Okay.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.800]   So I, okay.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:36.800]   Hey, look at me.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.800]   I'm not picking on it.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.800]   I'm in tour, peeling.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.800]   Okay.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.800]   Here we go.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:41.800]   No, no, no.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:42.800]   I appreciate you're defending me on this one.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.800]   Well, furthermore, it expands to a gig and a half when you're installing it.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.000]   So you have to have a free gig and a half on your iPhone.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.560]   And then when it's done, it gets down to a little bit more manageable 700 megabytes.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.400]   It is missed.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.960]   This is now available on the iPhone, the full game.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.400]   It's the same exact pre-rendered art that was in the original mist.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400]   How's the experience for you?
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.400]   I do like it.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.400]   It's better.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.400]   You know why?
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.400]   Because it's very, it's suitable for the touch.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:12.520]   You know, so you can, you use your finger to scroll around, to touch things, to move
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.520]   around.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.040]   And I think that that really actually makes it a better game.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.520]   It's still too damn hard.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.520]   Right.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.760]   I'll never solve the starting thing.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   I'm doing patient.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760]   That's too much trouble.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.160]   And of course, I guess the people who published the missed solution guides now are back in
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.920]   business thinking, start publishing them again.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.080]   But this is $5.99.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.680]   And I think a great thing to have on your iPhone, even if it's going to take me years
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:41.200]   to solve it, will be if you've got the room, this is a, this is a, this is the old favorite.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:46.000]   Perhaps for many people, the first really serious computer game they ever played, certainly
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.640]   the first serious game on the Mac.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.720]   I don't think you can include Alice chess is the first serious game.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:55.200]   No, I think I got through like level one or two and then I was like, okay, it is hard.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.200]   But it's beautiful.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.200]   Now it's pre rendered.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.360]   So yeah, there's some, a little bit of animation.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:01.240]   It's just exactly like the one, the original one on the Mac.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.800]   That's what's interesting is the graphics are the same.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:07.640]   It just proves that the iPhone is essentially as powerful or more powerful than the 1993
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   Macintosh.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.400]   Because that's what this was a big hit for.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:17.320]   M Y S T. You do have to have a lot of space on your phone, but it is, I'm glad I have it.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.240]   It's a fun thing to have since you brought it up.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.040]   What was going to be my original pick of the week, but unfortunately, I can't get access
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.120]   to the iTunes store because of a problem unrelated to anything that anybody listening
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.120]   to the show would be responsible for.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.240]   Steve caps, the guy who originally did Alice for the Mac has created an iPhone version
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240]   of the application.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240]   You're kidding.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.360]   Well, so that would be worth downloading.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.160]   It's, I'm, again, unfortunately, I don't have access to the iTunes store.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.680]   I couldn't, I couldn't bring up the, the page.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:50.480]   But on top of everything else, he has also created a, trying to find it.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.480]   I'll find it here.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   I can find it.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.480]   I'll find it here.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.200]   Not only that, but he also has a JavaScript version of it.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.200]   Oh my goodness.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:05.320]   Up on one doto.onedoto.com, O N E D O T O dot com slash iPhone slash Alice.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.720]   Now this was a, this was a famous game for me.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.320]   It was, it was the very first, I believe it was not only the first game for the Macintosh,
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.920]   but the first piece of software, of commercial software released for the Macintosh.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.240]   It is a chess chess board like game in which you are Alice.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.520]   The other game pieces are right at the other end of the board.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.240]   Your job is to using any legal chess move, move Alice and capture every single piece
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.680]   before those pieces capture you.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:37.400]   It was a crucial app in my personal development because I recently did another check and it
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:42.680]   turns out that 8% of all curse words currently in play were created by me.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.520]   It is an unplayable game on the Mac, on the Macintosh.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.640]   It was absolutely unplayable.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   Unplayable.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:55.120]   I will not, I will not send this, this, this podcast into the explicit tag, but I'd be
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.120]   like, dang.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120]   Okay.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.120]   Wait, start again.
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.120]   Okay.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.120]   Okay.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.120]   Okay.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.120]   Wait.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.120]   Hang on.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.320]   You realize that a personal computer is much, much faster than you can't play this game.
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.280]   But on the iPhone, it's actually a lot more, I don't know whether he slowed it down or
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:16.400]   just, you know, grew a soul or something, humility, a pity for, for, for us, poor mortals.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.120]   But it's actually very, very playable.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.200]   It's a very, very quick, fast, a little political.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.480]   It looks like there's a Republicans versus Democrats version as well.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.920]   Yes, you can get a variety of different chess pieces for it.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.600]   A buck 99, it's, it's, it's, it's a lot of fun.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.880]   It was also, I don't think that I will ever get so angry with this game that will cause
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:40.920]   my finger to crash right through the glass of the iPhone, which would be a definite problem
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.000]   if this were available for the Mac again.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.800]   But I, I, it got my pulse up.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.400]   It got me thinking, okay, wait, I can go the shape of an L left, right front.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.680]   Is that a fact I could simply win this.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.240]   It took, it took me what?
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.160]   It took me, you know, since from 1985, a four, a T-85 to now, but I finally won a game of
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.160]   Alice.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.160]   So that, that, oh, you, that's something.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.480]   Yeah, cause I don't know anybody's ever won a game of Alice.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.560]   I'm going to download it just for that.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.560]   Just for that.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.040]   Buck 99, it'll do.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.040]   All right.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.040]   There you go.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.040]   Some extra bonus bonuses there.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.960]   Hey, it's a two, somebody said you must be made of money.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.520]   You just clicked on purchase a buck 99.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.440]   Well, I don't want to flop my money bags mentality, but you know what?
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.440]   I paid a duck 49 for my soda.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   There you go.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.440]   There you go.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.160]   I could have had water from the tap.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.160]   That's exactly how that.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.880]   Ooh, big bucks.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:35.120]   Hey, you must be made of money.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.120]   Wow.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:43.000]   The MTV cribs crew is coming over to show, to show my off brand like double pack of Duracells
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.640]   and I was able to swing by all about the copper blink, baby.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:47.640]   Oh, baby.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   Let me play Alice here.
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.920]   I just, I did, I downloaded it, but I downloaded it guys for you.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.320]   I downloaded it so you could see this on the iPhone.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.320]   Oh, this is cool.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.480]   And it's, it's very much very reminiscent.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.320]   This is a good nostalgia choice.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320]   Look at that.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.200]   Alice has fallen down the rabbit hole into a chess game.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.240]   You could pick your starting level lazy, late flying.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.840]   Oh, this is, wait a minute.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.480]   Who am I?
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.320]   This is, I looked like a, I'm a, the fawns.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.320]   Oh, man.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.920]   It's too fast for me.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.160]   Oh, man.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.160]   Oh boy.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.160]   This is fun.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160]   Oh, he got me.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.440]   You could, I mean, you could actually capture several pieces before you die the first time
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.440]   you play it.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.440]   So.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.320]   We should also say it is not a chess game.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.240]   I don't know what it is, but it ain't chess.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.560]   It's something Steve caps made up.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.440]   It's classic arcade in the sense that the rules that you learn at the first level of
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.680]   the game continue to be the rules that you follow for the rest of the game.
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.080]   They just keep getting faster and harder and more challenging.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.080]   It's fun.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.680]   It's like defender or asteroids.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.880]   It's not like you're going to be suddenly, you know, so being Alice, you're now going
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:02.440]   to be Mecca, Titanic Eve with a laser cannon and a, and whip, and whip attacks is going
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.520]   to be this, but it's going to be fun.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.240]   It's going to be fun and understandable.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.400]   It is actually, I can't stop playing.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.920]   It's the fact.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.760]   All right, folks, we're going to wrap this sucker up.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.200]   Thank you almost so much for being here.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.640]   Don't forget, of course, that you can watch us do this live every Tuesday afternoon, 2

[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.680]   this one.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:39.160]   Alex Lindsey is the head honcho at the Pixelcore Pixelcore.com.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:42.480]   He also puts up a number of podcasts of just the core.t.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.480]   Just a few.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.480]   Pixelcore.tv.
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:52.720]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times and his website, CWOB.com.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.240]   And we'll see you out here soon in June.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.240]   I'm excited.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240]   Yes.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   Look forward to it.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:04.920]   And of course, the great Scott Born at Scott Born.com and the new show, Photo Focus.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.920]   Is that right?
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920]   Thank you.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.920]   Photo Focus.com, Photo Focus on iTunes.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:09.920]   All right, we'll look for it.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:10.920]   Thanks Scott.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:11.920]   Thanks everybody.
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.520]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   Thanks.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.640]   Thanks.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   Bye.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.640]   Bye.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.640]   Bye.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.640]   Bye.
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:38.160]   (music)
