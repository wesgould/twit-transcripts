[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.520]   it seems Andy Inako's on a boat in Bermuda.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.920]   Alex Lindsey's in Zimbabwe.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.760]   Merlin, man, I don't know what his excuse is.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.640]   But hey, good news.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.800]   That means we can bring in fun people, like Chris Breen,
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.200]   the Mac Daddy.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.000]   I never get to go anywhere.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.720]   You've been on a cruise.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.760]   I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.840]   Have you been on any of those Mac Mania cruises ever?
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.280]   I have.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.200]   I've been on a couple of them.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.320]   I thought you had.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.040]   Yeah, Bermuda sounds OK.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.960]   I'm looking for you next year.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.360]   Well, I did the Baltic with you.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.080]   That's right.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.800]   You remember, I remember that you and Derek Street coming back
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.120]   way late, right?
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.840]   Yeah, it was actually Ben Long and I were in Long.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.880]   Gosh, get on the-- I mean, we had to leap over the dock
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.920]   across the water to get on the boat.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.280]   The boat was sailing.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.520]   And you were up there on the floor.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.040]   I was waving.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   Go and fly.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.520]   Sleeze.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.800]   Breen, Ben, get back here.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.120]   Also, it's good to have you.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.400]   Thank you for joining us today, Chris.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.880]   Also joining us from San Francisco.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.800]   She's visiting.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   All in pink.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.480]   Pretty in pink.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.400]   It's I Justine.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.640]   Hello, Justine.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.560]   Hello, how are you?
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.720]   Justine is Eric.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.000]   Very well.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.440]   Haven't seen you in ages.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.160]   It's been a while.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.480]   I know.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.840]   And I am not on a boat.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.680]   But you are on YouTube like crazy.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.720]   Yes, I spent too much time there.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.000]   And you've got a high-def camera.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.400]   You don't use an eyesight anymore.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.960]   I know.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.040]   I've upgraded.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.800]   I'm impressed.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.440]   Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.200]   I was talking-- somebody asked me on the radio,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.120]   what kind of camera to get for his video podcast.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.680]   I said, well, Justine just uses an eyesight.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.520]   And then when they went to your site,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.040]   it's like, hi, definitely thought, oh, shoot.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.560]   I used to.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.240]   I mean, I still use it for some things.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.200]   And it still works.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.800]   But it's time to upgrade.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.400]   You're too fancy now for that.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.440]   You've got all those all the parody videos and everything.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.880]   I just love those.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.320]   Thank you.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.920]   Are you Beyonce in the last one?
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.960]   I can't remember.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.640]   I think I did.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.840]   Kesha was the last one.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.720]   Yes, I don't see.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.960]   I know that they're famous, but I don't know who they are.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.360]   Great to see you.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.040]   Thank you.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.320]   And from all the way from Liverpool, from the UK,
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.480]   in his anamorphic studio, looking fine.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.960]   Don McAllister from ScreenCastsOnline.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.880]   Yeah, but hi, Leo.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.040]   Great to see you.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.560]   How are the iPad screencasts coming?
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.960]   How are the iPad screencasts coming?
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.120]   Have you figured out a way to capture the screen yet?
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.280]   No, it's a bit of a letdown, actually.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.440]   No, you can only really capture the output
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.360]   from the keynote application at the moment.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.120]   So I'm going to have to switch across to my camera work,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.160]   which is OK, actually, because the screen's so bright,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.320]   and if you control the reflections, it's not too bad.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.560]   But yeah, I would really like to be
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.440]   able to capture the screen itself.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.400]   Because if I can get hold of the developers
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.200]   for tick applications, I can always run it in the simulator.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.640]   So that's what I did for the most recent one,
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.560]   and that works really well.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.600]   I'm curious, because we want to do--
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.920]   we're interested in doing an iPad show.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.320]   And I think I'm definitely doing an iPad show.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.760]   I'm too excited about the iPad now.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.480]   That way we can segregate all the iPad nonsense into one show.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.600]   But I'm trying to figure out how we're going to shoot it.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.840]   I think what we're going to do is I'm
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.400]   going to make a green screen cove in here.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.320]   I think Sarah Lane's going to co-host it with me,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.640]   and maybe Tom Merritt, too.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.840]   Because we're all iPad fanatics.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.600]   We're going to get a green screen cove.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.000]   And then when we're showing an app, we'll be in the app.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.400]   But that doesn't solve this problem.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   How do you shoot the app?
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.800]   I have to figure out a way to do that.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.880]   Yeah, a live camera at the moment.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.400]   That's the only way to do it.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.520]   And if you do it in the emulator, does it look like it's really
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.040]   the app?
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.640]   It does.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.280]   Yeah, it is actually the app itself.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.800]   And you can do clever things.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.160]   I put an iPad frame around it.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.840]   So if you want to make it look as though it's
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.120]   re-ringing on the iPad, you can do that.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.720]   I experimented with--
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.440]   because the iPad is--
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.680]   obviously, you have portrait and landscape mode.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.360]   I actually experimented with doing a screen cast that
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.600]   ran on the iPad itself.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.080]   And it actually turned.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.880]   So you actually physically have to turn the iPad.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.000]   And that's great.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.520]   I got it.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.600]   Is that worth?
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   I got to try that.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.880]   I did it for things.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.680]   If you go--
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.440]   people want to go across to the website.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.320]   There's a special version of the thing.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.520]   Just a small seven minute things video I did.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.440]   And that's formatted for the iPad.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.280]   Actually, you do rotate the iPad while you're watching
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.000]   the screen cast.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.480]   It works very well.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.080]   How clever.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.360]   That's screencastonline.com.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.560]   That's really clever.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.040]   All right.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.560]   We're going to have to steal some things from Don McAllister.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.640]   He's weird at all that.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.560]   I'm always here to help.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.880]   So I guess the big story-- a couple of big stories.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.320]   One is Apple has sold now a million iPads of all type 300,000,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.360]   I think, of the 3G.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.720]   Apple points out that that's much more than the iPhone
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.480]   sold in its first outing.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.440]   What do you think, Chris Breen, is that Apple's to Apple's?
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.960]   No.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.800]   I mean, it's not a big surprise.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.160]   When Apple says, oh, look, we sold twice as many
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.760]   as we sold of the original iPhone.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.840]   Well, the iPhone at that point was an untested device.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.760]   People didn't have any idea how Apple was the fair in this space.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.880]   Before it was released, a lot of people said, oh, well, Apple's
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.480]   never going to be able to compete in this space,
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.040]   because there's Nokia and there's Motorola.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.040]   And there's all these other companies
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.800]   we don't care about anymore.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.920]   Now that we have the iPad, it really
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.680]   is sort of iPhone 3.0.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.720]   It's been tested through-- the iPhone
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.200]   has been tested through the iPod Touch.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.960]   So people are familiar with the interface.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.040]   And there are 200,000 apps.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.400]   Yeah, there are 200,000 apps.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.480]   So it isn't like this is an unknown quantity.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.160]   And people say, gee, I wonder what this is going to do.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.960]   We're all pretty clear what it's going to do.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.320]   I don't think it's at all surprising
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.400]   that they've sold a million in this amount of time.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.160]   Are you surprised, Justine, a million?
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.120]   I'm not surprised at all.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.120]   I know I bought two.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.960]   I did buy the one.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.880]   I went first came out.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.480]   You're a punter.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.720]   I bought eight now.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.280]   I have eight.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.760]   Well, I'm not going that far.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.200]   I had to use dummy accounts.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.000]   I had all sorts of things.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I'm such a big fan of it.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.320]   And it's not really like you're buying an iPhone.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.120]   So there's no commitment to pay monthly.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.800]   So I think for a lot of people, they
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.680]   didn't want to get an iPhone because they were already
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.960]   on Verizon or some other carrier.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.720]   And with the iPad, it's just sort of--
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.960]   it's just kind of a big iPhone that does sort of everything.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.440]   But you don't have to pay the monthly fee.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.800]   So I think for a lot of people, that
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.280]   was one of the big issues with the iPhone.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.600]   By the way, being told by the chat room that I said this show
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.200]   was about all things Microsoft.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.680]   You did.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.160]   I was just going to screw you around.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.800]   Did that fool you?
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.760]   Oh, forget it.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.800]   Let's talk about Windows 7.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.560]   You don't mind, do you?
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.800]   Was my idea.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.680]   It was not my idea.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.960]   I like it that add they're running down the Microsoft
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   there with the French woman in the cafe.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.680]   It's pretty funny.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.320]   Windows 7, and it's all in France.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.880]   It was my idea.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.880]   And then she says, I think I've had too much coffee.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.920]   Too much French friends.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.280]   How about you, Dom and Calistair?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.040]   You're in UK, so you cannot yet buy the iPad.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.720]   You came to the States to get one.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.760]   A Wi-Fi iPad.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.320]   Yes.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.720]   Do you wish you had a 3G now?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.640]   Not really.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.200]   Not really.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.720]   I'm one of the people who well in advance
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.640]   sort of sort of myself out with a Wi-Fi unit.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.440]   So the intention always was to come across,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.760]   get the Wi-Fi unit.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.520]   And just use my Wi-Fi for the connectivity.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.000]   And that's working really, really well.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   So I can't really see a need for me at the moment
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.440]   to go down the 3G route.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.800]   But I have to say, I think the figures have surprised me
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   a little bit, because I did expect the first sort of tranche
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.320]   of people to actually get the iPad would be those people who
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.160]   actually knew what they wanted to do with it,
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.920]   people who were looking forward to it.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.400]   And the fact that there's over a million of those people who--
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.920]   I don't think many people actually took it sort of on spec
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.240]   and just thought they'd buy it and see what it was like.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.320]   I think most people who actually bought it did actually
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.400]   want it and could see what it fitted in with their particular
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.360]   workflow or within their lifestyle.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.760]   So it's a slight surprise to me that so many people actually
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.000]   have bought it so early on.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.480]   I think now that it's out there in the wild
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.200]   and people will start to see it being passed around
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.400]   and start to use it themselves and see
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.960]   how those people who knew what it was about now
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.880]   start to use it.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.760]   I think you'll probably see even more--
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.520]   the figures will just explode now from this point on.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.520]   I would imagine.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.360]   Well, it could go either way.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.720]   I mean, it could be that there were--
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.480]   I mean, most of the iPads were--
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.280]   the first 300,000 were bought sight unseen.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.200]   Nobody had seen one.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.520]   So that was just like the crazy Apple people buy anything.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.600]   And then the 3Gs, nobody had tried the 3Gs.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.120]   So another 300,000 on spec.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.640]   I think there were a lot of people who waited--
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.880]   didn't buy the Wi-Fi one because they knew they wanted the 3G one.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.800]   So more than half of those million iPads
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.640]   were sold to people who hadn't tried one.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.040]   So I suppose it's possible if you want it,
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.600]   you could argue this that maybe the sales will now die
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.160]   because all these people just drank the Kool-Aid
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.320]   and now that they've got it, it's going to not take off.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.680]   Does that even seem possible?
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.560]   I mean, it's hard to say that people haven't tried it
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.240]   because pretty much everyone has touched an iPhone or tried
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:50.880]   an iPhone.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.280]   And it's pretty much the same OS.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.240]   It operates the same.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.760]   I don't know if you guys have seen tons
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.000]   of those YouTube videos of the little kids
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.880]   that their parents had let them test out the iPad for the first time.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.400]   And it's so intuitive that they just go through and they're
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.760]   trying to find their favorite apps.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.000]   And it's so cute, but it's so easy to use
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.440]   that I think everyone really knew what they were getting themselves into.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.240]   I actually, that happened at home.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   I got the 3G, so I handed off the Wi-Fi iPad to my wife
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.480]   because she uses it in the house.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.080]   And she said, oh, I'll need a lesson.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.480]   Use it.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.200]   And my son, 15-year-old son, said, mom, you already know how to use it.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.040]   Don't you know how it's-- what are you talking about?
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.920]   How to use it?
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.360]   And I would be very curious.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.240]   Has anybody set somebody down who's never
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.680]   used an iPhone in front of this?
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.640]   One of the things I find difficult
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.480]   is that there is no unified user interface.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.440]   So each program, I keep tapping with one finger, two fingers,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.280]   and three fingers to see what it does.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.160]   And I have one program, a speed test program,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.520]   that as far as I can tell does nothing.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.240]   I've tapped it in every-- rub my nose on the thing,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.640]   and nothing happens.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.680]   And I think that might be a little bit of a problem.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.320]   There isn't a standard user interface
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.800]   once you get into an application.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.880]   Yeah, I think that they try.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.040]   People have had experience with the iPhone and the iPod touch.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.400]   You use these things for a while, and you want to just say, OK,
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.880]   well, this generally means do this, and this means that.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.560]   But there are some applications like Sketchbook Pro.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.240]   Sketchbook Pro.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.240]   It's my crazy.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.520]   My daughter loves.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.600]   I love it, too.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.120]   But how do I get to the tools?
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.400]   Oh, there's a gesture for that.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.320]   And what's that again?
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.760]   Then I have to go to help and go, oh, yeah, I have to do--
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.440]   Triple tap.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.280]   It's yeah, or that, or something.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   Or you tap the little disk and move things around.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.920]   Really go this way, or this way, and then triple tap.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.840]   Triple tap.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.560]   So there are all those casual applications
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.280]   you get in there and just go, I guess they've never
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.160]   seen an iPhone before, or they think
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.840]   that they do it better in a more interesting way.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.000]   Even Apple stumbled on this, because I
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.800]   sat for about 20 minutes looking at pages in landscape mode,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.560]   saying, where's the menu?
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.080]   Where's the menu?
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.600]   Where's the menu?
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.080]   Where's the menu?
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.920]   Where's the menu?
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.280]   Finally, I literally went to my notebook, my notebook
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.040]   mother, and went online.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.200]   Oh.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.720]   You have to be in portrait mode, and then the menu just shows up.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.000]   Yeah, and it's interesting that they haven't talked about how
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.520]   that happens, but that happens in a lot of applications
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.240]   where you think, this seems very limited to me.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.040]   Oh, turn it.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.880]   Ah, look.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.120]   There's a whole new interface element.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.840]   Maybe I'll get used to that.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.160]   But it does be lie the notion that it's just,
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.800]   or any idiot can figure it out, because unless I'm
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.040]   in particularly dense idiot--
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.280]   It depends on the apps.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.800]   I know there was another application
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.440]   too where I could not find the pause to pause the game.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.080]   And there's no buttons at all.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.280]   You just touch the top left corner,
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.560]   and it prompts you to pause the game.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.240]   And I just accidentally happened to hit it.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.560]   So they need to do something about trying to unify all of this.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.400]   It's always the home button.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.080]   I told my wife, if you get lost, just press the home button.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.640]   But it's frustrating.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.120]   That's the only thing that I've had to do,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.040]   is to remind-- even iPhone and iPhone touch users.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   They see this big application in front of them,
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.160]   and then they sort of lose and go, what do we do now?
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.120]   They say, just press the home button,
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.040]   and you just say that twice.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.520]   And then they go, oh, yeah, of course.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.440]   Well, of course, then you have the problem of which orientation
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.000]   you have the iPad.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.680]   The first day I got it, I was continually sick.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.760]   It was on the left, or on the right,
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.720]   or on the top, or on the bottom.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.640]   So it's-- perhaps they need four home buttons, one on each.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.320]   I have taken to locking my rotation, actually.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.760]   Because I use it mostly always in the landscape mode.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.880]   For some reason, I just don't feel compelled
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.000]   to use it any other way.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.680]   No, I like it in the portrait mode.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.360]   Especially if I'm doing my RSS feeds.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.640]   I like the fact that you can see a whole page of the nation
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.720]   when it's in portrait mode.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.800]   Yeah, I find that very-- and emails as well.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.480]   It's much nicer to read your emails in portrait view
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.000]   rather than landscape view, because you can still
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.680]   navigate the folders by tapping the button in the top corner
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.840]   and having the overlay pop down.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:49.160]   And a 99-year-old woman in Lake Oswego, Oregon,
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.640]   has now gone viral.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.320]   I wonder if she's the oldest person ever to go viral.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:55.840]   I saw that.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.120]   You're an expert on that, Justine.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.680]   And would you say that 99 is the oldest person ever
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.440]   to have a viral YouTube video?
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.240]   I don't know.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.200]   I mean, this is a pretty cute video, though.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.160]   Well, it should be viral.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.240]   I'm not complaining about it.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.880]   I'm pretty-- so she's 99 years old, and they gave her an iPad.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.680]   Those are awesome.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.000]   And they're showing her how to use it.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.640]   She's using it just like my wife does, by the way, on a pillow.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.160]   It's kind of cute.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.960]   This is-- this-- you could make an ad for Apple with this.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.320]   There is-- there have been some anecdotal evidence
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.560]   that it is a lot of seniors getting iPads.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.320]   I got one from my 80-year-old father-in-law
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.680]   because he was on dial-up, and it was
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.480]   paying for him to go downstairs to the big computer downstairs.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.680]   And I'm hoping that he will just be able to sit with it upstairs,
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.440]   get the $15 a month in it.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.040]   Look at this.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.800]   So cute.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.840]   He's typing on the keyboard.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.720]   I've actually found that I'm pretty fast at typing on here.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.920]   Me too.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920]   Me too.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.960]   This is a great video, I have to say.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.560]   I'm captivated by Virginia and her iPad.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.000]   This is so awesome.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.840]   Well, it's great.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:12.560]   When you can be 99 years old and still be part of the modern times.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.680]   Well, I have a story along that.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.160]   My mother's husband just turned 100 in December.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.280]   And we asked him what he wanted for his birthday.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.680]   And he said, well, I want a Kindle
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.480]   because he needs big type.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.400]   And that seemed like the proper device for him.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.800]   I said, well, hang on a second.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.040]   There's actually something coming out
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.720]   that you may want more than that.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.440]   So we're considering getting him an iPad.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.240]   She wrote a limerick.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.080]   Apparently she writes limericks.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.480]   It goes, to this technical nitty,
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.960]   it's clear in my compromised 100th year
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.440]   that to read and write are again within site of this Apple iPad
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.120]   pioneer.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.320]   There he is.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.680]   Yeah, Kindle is great.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.600]   My mom, same thing.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.680]   My mom's in her 70s reading on the Kindle.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.600]   Does this replace the Kindle for you guys?
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.320]   It's kind of like Kindle.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.920]   Oh, God.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.720]   You don't OK, Leaf Blower guy first.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.760]   Oh, sorry.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.120]   I can go talk to the Leaf Blower guy.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.320]   No, no, I love it.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:10.920]   I love it.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.280]   No, no, because it's real.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.480]   It's real.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.360]   I could turn around here.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.760]   I'm just waving to the Leaf Blower guy.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.260]   Right?
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.640]   You're side to the window.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   You know how I know it's Leaf Blower guy?
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.200]   Because there was--
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.040]   See, Leaf Blower guy?
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.600]   Yeah, sure.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.760]   Every time I do a radio show, Leaf Blower guy
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.400]   comes to my office.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.200]   Hey, Leaf Blower guy.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:26.640]   You're on--
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.160]   He's so close.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:27.760]   Hey.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.440]   Oh, no wonder we hear him.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:29.880]   Yeah, he's right.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.240]   You're in the garden.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.160]   He's in with you.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.640]   He's right outside there.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.240]   Leaf Blower guy.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:33.720]   Come back here.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.760]   Come back here.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.920]   Show him an iPad.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.320]   There's an app in that.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.320]   No, OK.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.000]   That was Leaf Blower guy.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.440]   How long before 70 makes--
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.120]   Ah, Leaf Blower app.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.360]   That was by the end of the show.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.560]   You know, until they do the most annoying app,
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.360]   I've already played this for other shows,
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.560]   but I suppose I should play it for you.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.160]   The most annoying-- maybe not the most annoying.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.600]   It's worse than any fart app could ever be.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.040]   Have you heard the Kitty Cat keyboard app?
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.880]   Cat.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.280]   Cat Piano.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.320]   I've seen the video of this.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.520]   There's actually an app for now.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.040]   [SQUEALING]
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.960]   It has different cats.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.720]   Here's a warbler.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.640]   [SQUEALING]
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.600]   There's-- this is the best one, Angelic Meow.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.600]   [SQUEALING]
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.560]   You could do.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.240]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.080]   You could do the Kitty.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.600]   This is asthmatic flea bag.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.880]   [SQUEALING]
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.680]   Anyway.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.440]   So until Leaf Blower app, we've got Cat Piano.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:40.720]   Go ahead.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.840]   Interrupted your anecdote, Chris.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.280]   Oh, no.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.000]   I said something about the weight of this thing.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.800]   Kindle is nice and light.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.840]   This doesn't bend in the middle.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.560]   It's kind of big.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.880]   And after about a chapter or a chapter and a half in bed,
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.760]   my arms get tired.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.120]   Even though you hold it with your elbows this way
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.840]   and you're reading along, it's not really the perfect in bed
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.360]   reading to us.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.920]   So you don't like it for books?
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.720]   I mean, it's great that it can do that.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.640]   And it's great for comic books because of the color.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.740]   But I think for long-form books,
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.440]   Kindle may be the better way to go.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.760]   You know, I find even a Kindle is too heavy to hold up.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.440]   I rest it on a pillow or in my belly, which is about the same.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.800]   How about you, Justin, you read?
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.400]   I still really like to read an actual book being
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.320]   such a digital person.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.040]   I know, I know.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.760]   But my eyes do get really tired when
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.520]   I'm looking at the iPad for long periods of time,
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.320]   even because I have the same glossy screen monitor.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.200]   And my eyes just get exhausted from looking
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.320]   at that types of screens.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.040]   And it's so bright.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.760]   So the Kindle might be a better choice for people
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   to get to the end of the day.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   I think, yeah, definitely.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   Because it's like you're actually reading paper.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.840]   So I don't think it'll kill the Kindle,
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.680]   but definitely will, I think, hinder some purchases.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.480]   You don't have access to a Kindle, do you, John?
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.680]   Well, I think we do have them in the UK now, actually.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.040]   Yeah, they've come out.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.120]   But I'm not a great reader.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.080]   And the Kindle never really--
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.840]   I mean, we've had the Sony ebook readers over here
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.440]   for a long time.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.680]   But I've never really sort of it's,
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.000]   well, I'm a gadget free.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.040]   I've never really sort of wanted to go down the ebook route.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.760]   But I have to say, I think there's
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.040]   something about having digital possessions
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.880]   with the iPad, because the iPad is a book reader anyway.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.200]   I sort of get a hankering now to actually get more books
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.320]   onto the iPad, just for the sake of having them.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.360]   I mean, I've got paper books.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.120]   And I was thinking a couple of days ago,
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   wouldn't it be great if all the books had bought them last two
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.800]   years I could actually have on my iPad,
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.680]   because I've scattered all over the house and everything.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.880]   But I quite like reading on the iPad, actually.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.040]   And I've actually read more.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.040]   I've consumed more content, definitely, on the iPad,
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.240]   since I got it sort of--
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.680]   Oh, me too.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.080]   And browsing.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.480]   It's just so nice to use.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.680]   It's just a great way to consume content.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.000]   And my consumption's definitely gone up.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.240]   I definitely do.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.440]   I do find myself reading more blog entries
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.080]   and more news sites, because everything just flows.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.880]   Wired magazine reported-- what was it?
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.120]   Like 20%-- all of a sudden, 20% of its traffic
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.520]   is coming from the iPad.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.040]   Wired.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.240]   It's interesting.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.840]   So I think people are reading more.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.480]   By the way, there is a leaf blower app for the iPhone.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.480]   Oh, good.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:11.980]   All right.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.080]   I'll make sure to get that.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.580]   Thanks.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.680]   Thank you, Chad.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.180]   Awesome.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.880]   Thank you, Chadro.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.200]   However, not all is sunny in the world of Apple,
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.400]   despite the big sales on the iPad.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.680]   There is word that the US government, the feds,
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:32.480]   are looking into-- now, it's not even--
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.160]   it's not even an investigation.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.800]   They're investigating whether they will investigate
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.360]   the antitrust problems with Apple
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.840]   saying you can't use other people's programs to develop
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.040]   for the iPhone iPad.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.200]   So it's as removed as you can get.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.800]   No word about why they're doing that.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.160]   But you have to think somebody at Adobe
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.320]   screamed to a friend in Washington and said, hey,
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.920]   that's not right, is it?
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:04.900]   Yeah.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.120]   Yeah, there are a couple of things.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.400]   The whole idea that Apple could just
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.360]   throw this into the developers license and just say,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.440]   you may not do this.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.440]   And then Steve then has to come out and say, well,
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.400]   why you can't do this?
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.280]   And it's-- first of all, you couldn't run Flash because it
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.160]   slowed things down.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.560]   And then they said, well, and now you
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.280]   can't use their tools because that's
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.760]   putting in a layer between what we do and what you do.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.640]   And it's going to make less efficient apps than not.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.640]   So you just write everything with the kitchen sink in it.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.400]   There's about 800 ways to hate Flash.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   This just seems a little personal.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.600]   And the other conjecture is that this is more than just
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.080]   about Flash, that it also has somebody to do with the ads
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.120]   and the way that Apple's for being.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.280]   Developers from doing things with ads, and yet they can.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.160]   And so again, it does look like Apple's kind of saying,
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.000]   this is definitely ours, which is in their DNA anyway.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.520]   But it's a question of whether, has this crossed the line
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.120]   now where you can say, yes, this is yours,
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.360]   but you're being a little anti-competitive here.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   Explain to me why this helps I add.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:13.200]   Well, Apple is going into the advertising business in essence.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.800]   So they want their cut for selling these ads.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.560]   And they're saying to developers, we
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.360]   are going to be able to do this and integrate this.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.200]   And we're going to take a cut.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.800]   We do not want you to be able to get access
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.000]   to some of these ad components that we are maintaining
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.160]   for ourselves.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.720]   So for example, earlier this year,
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.760]   they said, if you can't do location-aware ads,
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.600]   just not going to happen, which could be a very powerful thing.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.360]   So if you've got an iPad and a local store has a--
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.760]   Oh, that's the holy grail.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.360]   Well, Apple said, no, you can't do that.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.200]   But not--
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.120]   Yeah, we can do that.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:48.840]   You can't do it.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.680]   You can't do that.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.880]   And that could be a huge source of revenue.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.800]   So that's another thing where people looking at ads
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.480]   going, I don't know.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.600]   Maybe not.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.920]   Do you think that this merits antitrust investigation?
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.760]   Justine, what do you think?
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.280]   I mean--
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.080]   How do your developer friends feel about this?
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.880]   I know I have a lot of flash developer friends.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.680]   So I think when a lot of them found out about this,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.760]   it's hard because this is what they're
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.120]   trained to do and what they do for their job.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.800]   And now that I even feel myself that I don't--
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.440]   if I can't view a website, then I just won't go back.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.840]   Using the YouTube player and the ABC player,
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.600]   which I guess I think last night they just updated the--
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.320]   It went 3K.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.680]   So I mean, everyone else is finding ways around it.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.720]   So I think it's just kind of something
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.120]   you're going to have to do.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.000]   You live on YouTube.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.480]   Your business is a YouTube business.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.400]   Yeah, and I-- oh, geez.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.480]   This is you as Keyshot.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.960]   I just got an iPad today.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   No iPad.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.040]   The iPad 3.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.560]   Called the iPad 3.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.160]   3.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.660]   3.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.760]   Even Keyshot apparently has a leaf lower problem.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.680]   Mine is interesting.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.280]   And when I'm singing and I'm done,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.800]   you know, so I can just have this.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.760]   I can have something.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.080]   That's very good.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.840]   For those that have no idea what's going on there,
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.360]   you have to watch a Kesha interview.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.640]   She's kind of a little crazy.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.360]   So I was like, well, what if Kesha got an iPad?
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.040]   So that was kind of take on that.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.920]   I got it.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.600]   I don't even know what Kesha is.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600]   She's a little crazy.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.600]   So maybe this is another thing that--
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.160]   you know, Apple might be--
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.960]   I mean, maybe there is reason to investigate Apple.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.760]   Because here's another-- this is from Openly--
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.200]   I'm sorry, Patently Apple.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:37.560]   The Apple blog that covers Apple's patents.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:43.040]   Is Apple test marketing eye travel in Montreal?
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.640]   Shh.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.320]   They say.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.280]   On April 21, Patently Apple presented a report
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.480]   on a high profile Apple patent relating
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.320]   to the travel industry, which covered an iPhone application
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.280]   called eye travel.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.360]   It's been the buzz or bane of the travel industry ever since.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.960]   The timing of the report couldn't have been any better
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.880]   considering the travel distribution
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.600]   summit is coming up in June in London.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.960]   How to build the perfect travel app
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.880]   will be one of the seminars.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.000]   Well, maybe you shouldn't.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.480]   If Apple's doing the eye travel app, apparently,
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.120]   if you go-- in Montreal is one of the few--
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.240]   Vancouver, Toronto, Paris, and London,
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.840]   the few markets where they're trying this out.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.080]   And I don't know.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.720]   That's an interesting-- how far can Apple go?
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.360]   Now they're saying, OK, we want the ad market.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.480]   And you can't really do anything cool
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.840]   unless we let you in our platform.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.760]   I imagine the same thing with games.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.160]   If they start writing apps, how greedy can Apple get
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.000]   before they really start getting in trouble here?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.920]   Don, do you have an opinion on this?
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.960]   Yeah, it's difficult.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.280]   I mean, the whole antitrust thing
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.640]   and the competitive nature of things,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.520]   I suppose it really depends on the market share
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.360]   and just how much clout they've got now.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.160]   Although they're still not the biggest mobile platform.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.120]   Although they might say they are the biggest mobile platform.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.040]   There's still tons and tons of competitors out there
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.160]   that have free rein to do wherever they want.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.440]   And Apple really are only sort of hankering down
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.400]   on their own platform.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.880]   So although it does have a knock on impact
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.200]   for the internet in general, because obviously,
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.040]   it is slightly contradicting myself now.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.760]   But it's such an important platform
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.520]   that if Apple go down that particular route
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.560]   of not supporting Flash,
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.360]   that others are likely to follow suit.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.920]   But I don't know the legalities of how big your market share
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.280]   needs to be before it actually just
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.920]   start to become anti-competitive.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.120]   It's got to be attractive to Apple because--
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.600]   Versus here's the patent application for iTravel.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.120]   You make reservations or retrieve reservations, check in.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.320]   You can book flights, hotels, car rental.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.680]   I mean, there's a lot of money on the table there.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.000]   And if Apple builds this into the phone--
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.280]   Yeah, but they're not stopping other people
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.000]   from doing the same, though, are they?
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.400]   And purely by the--
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.040]   Well, it's what Microsoft came up against
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.360]   with the internet explorer, where if you bundle the browser--
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.000]   and by the way, it got in trouble with the Department
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.760]   of Justice and the EU-- if you bundle the browser,
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.600]   that's anti-competitive.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.800]   Because it's coming from you and Opera didn't like it.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.000]   But don't forget, at that time, Windows
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.560]   have had like 95, 97% of the PC operating system market
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.080]   at that point.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.920]   So they were this huge juggernaut that
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.960]   were imposing this browser on everybody
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.920]   through the operating system.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.760]   Right.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.640]   Whether or not Apple-- we can mirror that with Apple
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.480]   with the-- as the mobile platform grows as more
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.840]   and more iPads, commanders, people move across to the iPhone.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.280]   It's a possibility, I must say.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.600]   It is my understanding.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.160]   And we always get letters from lawyers when I say things like
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.360]   that.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.840]   So I'm not a lawyer that you can do things
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.680]   if you're not a monopoly that, as soon as you become
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.760]   a monopoly, become problematic.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.120]   5% market share, Apple never had to worry about that
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.280]   on the desktop.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:57.080]   But they've got a pretty good market share in mobile, don't they?
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.680]   And it's growing.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.480]   And it's growing.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.880]   So I think this will be interesting to see
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.520]   what the US Federal Government Department of Justice does.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.560]   We're going to take a break.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.760]   We're coming back in just a moment.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.720]   Chris Breen is here with his leaf blower.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.600]   I thought at first it was your hairdryer.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.920]   I didn't know.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.520]   Well, it does take an awful big--
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.320]   I was going to say, to do this.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.560]   You have a guy come in, don't you?
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.720]   Yeah, he's all the way across the room.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.240]   He's flying all over the place.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.280]   Chris is the Mac Daddy, the senior editor at Macworld.com.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.680]   And always a pleasure to have you here.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.440]   Dharma Callister is also here, Justine Azarek.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.000]   And we are going to continue with our conversation
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.680]   in just a moment.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.040]   But first, I do want to mention our fine sponsors
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.640]   here at Mac Break Weekly.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.880]   Those without whom this show would not exist.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.600]   In fact, this is a new client.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.240]   Well, kind of an old client with a new product.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.160]   How about that?
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.320]   You've heard GoToMyPC.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.800]   We talk about Citrix all the time, the remote access product
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.600]   that we just love.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.280]   GoToMeeting, the meeting product we love.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.160]   Well, what if you took GoToMeeting and go to MyPC,
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.400]   you mushed them together, and you made a product for trainers.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.120]   Online training, that's what GoToTraining is.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.640]   Up to 200 people can connect to a training session
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.360]   right from their desktops.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.880]   You can do it in real time.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.280]   You can trade-- I love this.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.640]   You can trade training with other people.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.600]   So Don could do a bit.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.200]   I could do a bit.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:22.840]   Chris could do a bit.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.040]   Doesn't matter where we are, because you've
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.640]   got complete screen sharing capabilities.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.840]   Voiceover IP.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.640]   So you don't have to have a phone call going on.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.560]   They can just hear you, and you can hear them.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.320]   Chat.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.120]   But I love this.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.080]   You have session recording.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.680]   So you do it in real time, and then you can do it.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.840]   They can come back later and take the training again.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.960]   So 200 people in life, but as many as you want after the fact,
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.840]   you can create a training content library with any document
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.240]   type or links to any websites.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.520]   You've got a curriculum that your trainees can see before
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.080]   during and after the training.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.720]   You could send out emails, invites even as the training
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.520]   session is going on.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.160]   It's got an integrated email system.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.600]   You can create and customize tests, polls,
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.240]   all sorts of interactivity.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.800]   If you've sat through corporate training before,
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.600]   either in person or online, you know this
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.440]   is a big, big improvement.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.040]   These guys know what they're doing.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.520]   I want you to try it free, as always.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.840]   Citrix loves the-- give you the chance
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.480]   to try this stuff free.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:26.880]   By going to go to training.com, go to training.com.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.240]   That's it.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.640]   There's no special URLs.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.760]   Just go to that website.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.480]   Sign up today.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.640]   You get it absolutely free.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.400]   And I think you will find it's fantastic.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.480]   If you're an online trainer, check it out for 30 days free.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.120]   If you're not, if you just have to put up with online training,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.400]   you might want to mention this to the trainer.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.480]   Go to training.com.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.880]   We thank him for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.720]   So the other big story of the week this week--
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.680]   finally, we could stop talking about Gizmodo.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.160]   No, let's talk for a month.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.640]   What do you want to say about Gizmodo?
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.080]   Anything?
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.160]   Is there anything to say?
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   No, it's been covered so many times.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.120]   Is it true that Jason Chen put a fertilizer bomb in Times
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.240]   Square, or am I confusing things?
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.040]   I'm not confusing that one.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.080]   I'm confusing that.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.720]   I think that was an Apple engineer who did that.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.440]   Yeah, they were prototyping the iTerrorism application
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.160]   that we propped it in Times Square.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.440]   It took me forever to actually believe that that was real,
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.760]   because something like this does not happen to Apple.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.760]   You don't just lose an iPhone.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.120]   Honestly, I didn't believe it.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.040]   I didn't want to believe it.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.360]   But I think I believe it.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.480]   Did you think a lot of people--
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.240]   and it's funny, most of the time when I talk to tech pundits,
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.320]   they go now.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.680]   But most of the mainstream media people I talked to,
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.200]   because I did a lot of interviews the last two weeks
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.200]   of this subject, think Apple did on purpose.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.520]   I honestly have no idea.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.200]   I mean, I just-- I don't think that if you're an actual Apple
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.120]   employee, that you will lose an iPhone like that, no matter what.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.480]   So I really don't even know what to think.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.440]   I really don't.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.400]   Come on now.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.280]   Apple, this isn't how Apple works.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.360]   Krisping, you've been covering them for 43 years.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.280]   This isn't how Apple would do it.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.280]   You know, I think that somebody needs to do a chart.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:09.040]   Beer is the x-axis, and paranoia is the y-axis.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.840]   And you see at one point the two come together,
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.080]   because I think that beer exceeded paranoia there.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:17.800]   Yeah, it's just--
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.160]   That's all stupid.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   I mean, it's kind of nice.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.280]   They have to test them off-cant as well.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:22.720]   They have to.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.960]   Right, it's normal, right?
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.280]   Yeah, it's normal to go.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.040]   He was unlucky and too much beer.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.760]   Yeah, and still has his job, so that's OK.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.360]   I mean, the other thing is that now,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.760]   sort of break some of the preconceptions
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.680]   that we have about Apple.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.560]   They're not superhuman.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.400]   They're actually made of people.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.960]   And they can make genuine mistakes.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.320]   Made of people.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.440]   It's people.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.560]   Apple, it's made of people.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.760]   We do forget that, don't they?
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.600]   Sometimes seems--
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.680]   Yeah, you know it.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.320]   It was just inconceivable to think
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.200]   that an engineer would be in a bar with the next iPhone
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.720]   and just leave it somewhere.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.320]   Apparently, Justin, he doesn't believe it.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.680]   It's just unbelievable.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.040]   It rocked your world.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.760]   I believe it now, but I know that when-- before one of the iPhones
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.600]   came out that I was at an event and some Apple employee said,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.560]   hey, I have something to show you.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.200]   And I was like, oh, this is a little creepy.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.040]   And then they showed me one of the 3GS iPhones.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.600]   So I know they did test it off-site,
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.680]   but it still is just crazy.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.760]   It's crazy to me.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.600]   Don't say who did that, because remember when--
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.680]   I don't even know who it was.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.640]   It was like a stranger.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.000]   Because remember when the--
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.040]   Steve Wozniak said when somebody showed him a 3G iPad
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.040]   the day of the launch, he got fired.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:28.800]   Yes, I know.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.520]   That's crazy.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.160]   Showing it to an Apple employee, the day of the release
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.320]   of the product anyway, and he still got fired.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.200]   Be careful.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.360]   Anyway, enough about Gizmodo already,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:43.640]   even though the guy who found the phone regrets his mistake.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.760]   Well, and he's very good to children, too.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.320]   He's a nice fellow.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.600]   It's a very nice fellow.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.640]   And his attorney has made sure to already sort of start
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.480]   copying a plea to know he's really a really nice guy.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.120]   And he's just 21, and he's got a lot of loans to pay back.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.720]   And please, he's not a criminal.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.560]   His parents are very proud of him.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.640]   Don't hit me, Steve.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.520]   Don't hit me.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.440]   No, the big story I was thinking about is HP saying,
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.240]   we want to be in this game and buying saving Palm $1.2
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.640]   billion for Palm.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.840]   And really, the HP executives said--
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.120]   they didn't say anything about the phones.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:18.880]   They're not buying the pre.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.520]   They're not buying the PIXI.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.160]   They're buying WebOS, the Palm operating system.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.680]   And I can only think-- the only reason
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.840]   that HP, the world's biggest computer company,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.800]   would buy Palm for WebOS is if they
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.160]   want to make one of these puppies a slate.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.800]   Now, according to TechCrunch, apparently, people only
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.840]   speak to Mike Arrington.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.960]   They don't tell anybody else.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.120]   But according to TechCrunch, HP has decided
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.280]   to cancel the Windows 7 slate.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.000]   Has that actually been confirmed?
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.120]   Or is that still a rumor?
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.960]   Because it's a bit of a gray area to me.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.800]   I mean, it's such a huge shock to do that, especially after Mr.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.320]   Barmer gets up on stage to see, yes,
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.320]   and demonstrates this product that's going to launch.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.960]   And then makes you turn it on him.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.760]   He's not going to be very pleased about that.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.040]   I can fully appreciate that they want
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.360]   to go down the WebOS route with the mobile OS
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.680]   rather than the Windows 7, but still to cancel such a high
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.320]   profile product.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:18.240]   Are you thinking that Mike Arrington is wrong?
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:18.960]   Who am I to say?
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.520]   You know, it kind of makes sense to me.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.600]   I don't know what the truth of that rumor is.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.760]   But it kind of makes sense to me.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.960]   If you're sitting here with a slate,
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.360]   you have already made-- I have right in front of me right now--
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.720]   an HP tablet PC from four or five years ago.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.520]   They've made a number of them.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.280]   I don't know if they did the ultra-mobile PCs,
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.800]   but they've drunk the Microsoft tablet
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.320]   coolade for a decade.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.160]   And these things--
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.600]   I would be willing to venture--
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.840]   I'd love to find this number-- that all the tablets combined,
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.800]   all the Windows tablets combined have sold fewer units
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.640]   than the iPad in its first 28 days.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.480]   I think that's got to be accurate.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.600]   I think you're pretty close.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.360]   Just a flop over a 10-year period of flop.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:04.880]   So I--
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.120]   Because it's just a nightmare to you.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.400]   You don't want to-- I think what happens when you get this
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.600]   and you realize it-- and I'm sure the HP people--
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.040]   Mark Heard got one and said, oh, a desktop operating system,
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.760]   bad idea on a tablet.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.680]   So maybe, I mean, it would make sense.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.280]   Then they would cast their eye about for another mobile operating
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.000]   system, perhaps one that they could get on the cheap.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.960]   Preys having a fire--
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.240]   Poms having a fire sale.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.920]   They get WebOS.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.440]   Maybe they'll still do the slate.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.320]   No, they have to redesign it, because the slate as they
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.960]   specked it out-- again, another rumor.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.920]   But it seemed a pretty solid rumor was running an atom.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.400]   It was basically a net book, an atom Intel atom processor.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.000]   And of course, WebOS requires an ARM processor.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.520]   So they'd have to redesign it.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.560]   It would make sense that you would say, OK, well, hold on.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.440]   Let's not release the slate yet.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.240]   Let's redesign it.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.600]   Let's put an ARM processor in there.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.160]   Let's put WebOS on there.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.680]   So that's in a direct response to damage limitation
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   to the iPad itself.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.000]   Exactly.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.160]   Well, so close to it being released.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.800]   I mean, it must have been a complete shock to them
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.880]   when they saw it and thought, yeah, as you say,
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.000]   oh, hang on, we're completely going down the wrong track
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.800]   on this.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.720]   Let's retrace our steps and write, I just say, biparm,
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.800]   because they were up for sale.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.240]   And they have the WebOS, which is a mobile platform.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.080]   It makes sense to me.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.120]   But maybe that's because I've drunk the Kool-Aid myself.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:23.640]   I don't know.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.720]   Well, but I think it's surprising that anybody's surprised.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.280]   This is the third time around on this.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   So we've already had the iPod where people that
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.880]   were manufacturing MP3 players suddenly went, oh, oh,
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.080]   you do it like that.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.520]   And then we have the iPhone come out and people go, oh,
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.760]   touch interface, got it.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.120]   We need to do that.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.120]   And now suddenly the iPad comes out and says, oh,
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.840]   mobile computing is actually really important.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.160]   And we need to get in on the game.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.360]   Well, Apple's got a head start of several years on these folks.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.440]   And now they're going, oh, yeah, OK, well, yeah,
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.800]   we got to go buy an OS summer because what a horrible job it
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.440]   would be to develop it in-house.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.520]   As you say, they've looked at Windows and what that's
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.160]   had to offer.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.200]   And it hasn't worked for whatever reason.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.560]   It just hasn't sold.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.400]   So why keep hitting that nail?
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.640]   And finally, no, no, let's just get our own thing.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.880]   This is a perfectly fine operating system.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.160]   I love WebOS.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.960]   Yeah, hardware not so much.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.320]   Let's bring in-- it's a great hardware.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.120]   And maybe we can get in on this game.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.440]   And it's clearly a game they need to get in on.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.000]   I think, too, on a lot of the posts
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.960]   that I've talked about the iPad, a lot of people are like,
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.920]   well, why do I want this?
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.040]   And even though I'm the biggest Apple fan in the world,
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.360]   I was a little bit skeptical.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.640]   I was like, well, it doesn't have flash.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.240]   It doesn't have a camera.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.160]   But then I used it.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.000]   And it just completely changed the way
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.960]   that I browse the web, the way that I game,
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.840]   the way that I watch videos and consume content.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.000]   I watch a lot of TV.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.920]   The ABC app is pretty much just the coolest thing ever.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.760]   Now, I'm really excited if Hulu would get an app out.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.680]   They're supposed to.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.320]   In fact, it's--
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:48.840]   I've tried to get it heard.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.480]   The rumor is it'll be $10 a month, though.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.880]   Would you pay $10 a month for Hulu?
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.320]   I would.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   I would, yes.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:53.960]   I definitely would.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.200]   As long as there's an iPad app, and I can watch more than five
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.800]   episodes, then I would pay.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.680]   I think--
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.360]   You might see a crack in this wall
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.080]   that Hollywood has been so reluctant to put its content
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.680]   on digitally.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.760]   And there might be this crack in the wall where they suddenly
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.960]   go, well, we don't have to worry about piracy.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.840]   There's no, you know, notice, no disk drive, no USB port.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.120]   There's no piracy concern.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.040]   Maybe we will allow it on the iPad.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.000]   And that would be a breakthrough.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.480]   And the Netflix app, I was quite surprised how good it is.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.680]   It's great, even on 3G.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.840]   Although it downgrades the video quality on 3G, right?
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.560]   But I mean, a lot of the shows that you're going to watch,
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.200]   most of the time, that kind of stuff, you're probably
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.280]   going to be near Wi-Fi.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.960]   So I don't see myself sitting.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.720]   No.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.840]   Although it's great, I was in the park just playing with a 3G
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.760]   just to see what I could do.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.440]   And I ran Netflix.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.960]   And it was a completely acceptable experience.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.680]   And the fact that I could watch a Netflix movie in the park
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.200]   was pretty--
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.760]   It's pretty awesome.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.200]   --pretty rocking.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.080]   And so you're burning through your 250 megs.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.080]   Oh, no, no.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   And that's the end of the movie?
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.920]   Yeah, no.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.960]   In fact, there's some speed test.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.960]   There's a speed test out.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.600]   I downloaded all the speed test apps
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.120]   because I wanted to test the speed.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.000]   I had seen a very stupid rumor, which
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.400]   turns out not to be true, that somehow the 3G on the iPad
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.920]   was limited to 64 kilobits a second, not so.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.080]   I was able to get, depending on where I was,
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.360]   anywhere from pretty consistently,
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.600]   1 and 1/2 megabits per second to 2 megabits per second
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.040]   on AT&T 3G, as I wandered around.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.160]   Here in Petaluma, it's about two,
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.560]   because I don't think there's a lot--
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.800]   San Francisco is a little slower.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.720]   But still, 1 and 1/2 is plenty.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.200]   That's where I was watching Netflix.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:32.600]   250 megabytes would go pretty fast if you use this speed
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.960]   test app, because each time you used it,
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.280]   it downloads 10 megabytes.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.360]   You can use it 25 times.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:38.720]   And that's it.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.800]   Sorry, you're done.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.200]   But I think somebody like this 99-year-old Virginia,
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.920]   probably 250 megabytes of bassificient,
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.680]   that's how much my-- I'm sure my father-in-law
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.720]   will get initially.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.240]   I didn't--
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.200]   Just come back to the video experience, though, later.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   The thing was surprising.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.320]   I'm a big TV guy.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.760]   I've got the big TV in the living room.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.160]   And I wanted to watch a TV program that was on my Mac mini.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.800]   So I've got my Mac mini attached to the TV.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.320]   I've got a surround sound system that's also
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.200]   attached to the TV.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.600]   And I walked into the room.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.520]   And it was a case of either going across to the-- well,
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.520]   I didn't have to go across to the TV.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.400]   I could switch the TV on.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.680]   I had to physically walk across the room
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.240]   and press the HDMI switch button into switching
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.160]   to the Mac mini.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.600]   Then I would have to switch on the surround sound system.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.480]   And they set myself down, sort out the remote for the Mac mini,
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:16.840]   et cetera.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.400]   And you know what?
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.120]   I just didn't bother.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.200]   I just sat down, got the iPhone out.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:19.960]   Plus TV?
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.320]   Watch TV on using a video.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.000]   I just dreamed--
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.560]   And if you're holding it this close to your eyes,
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.240]   if you're at an arm's length, it's like a big screen TV,
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:27.880]   frankly.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.800]   I've come up, I'm a feet up, put it on my chest.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.760]   Actually, if I looked at the TV and the--
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.480]   I've got to do the iPad, it was literally the same size as the TV.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.240]   So--
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.200]   And it was-- I was watching the TV show in literally 10 seconds,
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.280]   15 seconds.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.480]   And there was no faff, and it was great.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.240]   And even the sound, the built-in sound--
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.440]   that's without earphones, the built-in sound on the iPad
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.280]   is great just for watching a TV show to the X, no problem at all.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.000]   So the question, I guess, is who should get 250 megabytes?
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.280]   Nobody who's-- I mean, $15 is attractive.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.080]   And by the way, for those who don't have the 3G,
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.400]   very easy that you sign up on-- you don't have to connect it
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.880]   to anything you sign up on the iPad.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.320]   Again, begging the question, why the hell
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.960]   do we have to connect it at all?
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.200]   I still don't understand Apple's thinking there.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.920]   But so you don't have to connect it with the 3G.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.040]   You sign up, it's a new account.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.840]   You do get a phone number, because I guess that's
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.240]   how they do 3G.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:24.800]   You can change it, they said, at any time to a higher--
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.440]   I don't know if you go from full time to 250,
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.600]   but you can go from 250 to full time.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.240]   So if you see, you're quickly going to max out.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.400]   You can go to the unlimited-- is unlimited really unlimited?
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.280]   I was reading the number of the one article that they said--
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.840]   Now to find out, I think they're just streaming constantly.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.480]   9 to 5 Mac is doing it, yeah.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:48.240]   If you go to 9 to 5mac.com/unlimited_data.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.480]   My only big complaint is that the 3G I definitely
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.720]   noticed killed my battery life.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.880]   Did it?
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.560]   Because I used the Wi-Fi one on several flights.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.480]   I would go to New York and back, and I wouldn't even
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.280]   have to charge my iPad.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.280]   But now with the 3G, if there's low 3G coverage, my battery,
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.600]   just I could just watch the percentages drop and drop.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.240]   I'm like, no, don't do that.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   So I turn it off a lot when I'm not using it.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.240]   That's interesting.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.760]   I leave it on, but I'm often on Wi-Fi.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.640]   So I presume there's not using it.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.680]   I'm sorry, it is not 9 to 5mac.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.440]   That article links to knowyourcell.com.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.720]   Knowyourcell.com.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.960]   And that's where they're doing the test.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.240]   It has to be very surprising if it is true unlimited.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.600]   I don't think there's ever been any sort of service
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.480]   provided to provide an unlimited service.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.880]   It's just how they get away with that.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.400]   It's always a fair use cap or some sort of cap.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.040]   I'm limited.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.480]   It has been 5 gigabytes up to now.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.000]   Right.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:43.600]   I thought there you go.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.960]   When I bought mine, I asked the Apple guy, I was like,
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.080]   so is this really unlimited?
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.880]   You're not really capping me at 5 gigs.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.120]   He's like, no, I swear.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.840]   It's completely unlimited.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.160]   I'm like, OK, so I'm limited my Verizon Wi-Fi is unlimited?
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.120]   He's like, no, no, no.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.120]   Not that kind.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.120]   Not like that.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.120]   Well, that's what AT&T has been saying.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.160]   So I'll be very curious to this knowyourcell test.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.920]   He has a few observances.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.360]   The 3G model is 1/10 of a pound heavier.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.560]   1.6 ounces.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.480]   I don't know how many grams.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.440]   That would be 28 plus 14.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.240]   As I remember from my days pedaling cocaine,
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.080]   I think that's--
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:19.920]   I don't know.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.720]   I mean, as I said before, the Wi-Fi is great.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.960]   I really love the Wi-Fi.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.040]   And it's so flexible as well.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.560]   You're not tired just of the device.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.880]   So you've got my iPhone.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.320]   I've got my laptop.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.560]   And they cannot run off the other Wi-Fi.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.640]   I did some tests on the Wi-Fi here in the States,
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.120]   because that's using Verizon-- the one I have
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.400]   is using Verizon in the States.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.560]   And it wasn't-- it was about the same speed.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.600]   It was a little bit slower than the native 3G.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.840]   The other difference is you have a plastic strip at the top.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.240]   That's, of course, where the antenna for the radio reception.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.560]   There's real GPS.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.920]   And by the way, the GPS is excellent on this.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.880]   I mean, it's fast.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.200]   It keeps it up to date.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.280]   It even seems to hover a little bit, move a little bit,
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.160]   as you're-- I mean, it's like real, real time.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.960]   I only complaint with the Verizon Wi-Fi is like,
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.800]   I'll have it in my purse.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.360]   And it'll just randomly turn on.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.240]   Yeah, I can't figure that out either.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.160]   And yeah, and then sometimes it'll just start blinking.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.680]   I'm like, what are you trying to tell me?
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:11.880]   I don't understand.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.360]   So then the battery life just-- it just dies.
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:18.520]   So that was my main thinking for getting the 3G iPad.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.160]   No, I'm-- yeah.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.320]   Mine does that too.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.840]   There should definitely be a lock that says,
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.800]   this is definitely off.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.840]   I want you to be off.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.520]   I want to save my juice.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.240]   But I think it turns itself off if you don't--
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.160]   I don't know.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   It does.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.480]   I will open my purse and it is on.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:32.960]   I know.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.480]   It's a mystery.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.480]   It's adding in how long it's been on.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.480]   And it turns on when you charge it.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.720]   I get some mystery with that thing.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.840]   It is.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.880]   So anyway, know your cell, I guess,
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.600]   is doing some sort of torture test.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.200]   He says, in my first two days with a new iPad,
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.720]   I've pumped just about-- get this-- 31 gigabytes of data.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:59.880]   Two days, 31 gigabytes of data.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.640]   Now, of course, he may get a bill.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.200]   He might get an iJustine sized bill at some point.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:04.680]   Oh, boy.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.080]   That would be interesting.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.480]   But there's nowhere that it's said.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.640]   I mean, actually, I didn't really read all of that text
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.720]   when I first signed up.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.280]   No, I didn't.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.600]   So I hopefully he did.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.400]   Because if he gets a bill, that's not going to be pretty.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.320]   He's going to try to hit 100 gigabytes in the month
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.640]   and see if he gets shut down or gets a big bill.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:27.280]   I would say I would wait till next month
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.560]   and see if Vazak survives the torture test.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.040]   Meanwhile--
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.000]   Well, I would have to think, too,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.560]   that they would put limits on things like the Netflix app.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.560]   If it is going to eat up this kind of thing,
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:42.120]   and everybody's streaming Netflix over 3G for $30 a month,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.800]   I would think somebody from AT&T would come over to Apple's
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.320]   house kicking the door and say, by the way,
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.000]   did you stop this from working?
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.240]   Because this isn't good for us.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.280]   Well, I think that's why people were worried when the ABC
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.560]   player did not work on 3G.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.880]   They thought, uh-oh.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.760]   But what Justine ABC just said, oh, no, we screwed up, right?
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.600]   And I'm a big ABC fan.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.040]   So I watch a lot of shows on there.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.960]   So I was very excited that I could now watch on 3G, just
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.200]   in case.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.160]   Is brothers and sisters any good?
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.280]   I actually haven't watched that.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.160]   That's the new Sally Fields show.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.600]   I did start watching "Happy Town," though, which is pretty good.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:16.960]   Is it good?
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:17.800]   It looks kind of scary.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   I was quite surprised.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.480]   It's a little cheesy, but it's a good.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.280]   She's OK.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.000]   I can live with cheesy.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.600]   Of course, lost.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.000]   I'm sure you're watched "Lost" on here.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.360]   I am.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.600]   I'm much sick of "Lost" actually.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.520]   I actually enjoy their sideways stories, much better
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.400]   than the flashbacks to the island.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.360]   I think ABC is really a chick network.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:34.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:35.080]   Let's see.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.880]   You're desperate housewives.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.960]   Raise anatomy.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:39.880]   I don't watch any of those.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.280]   Brothers and sisters.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.480]   Castle, which is--
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.560]   Castle is really good.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.280]   I like him because he was a firefly guy.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.640]   So I watched it just because of him.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.920]   Yeah, for murder mystery, it's pretty good.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.440]   Can you go back in time on "Lost"?
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.720]   Like, because I've never seen "Lost."
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   Could I go back and watch it from the beginning?
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.760]   Not on there.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.920]   I think you can on Netflix.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.280]   Did you start watching Netflix?
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:00.680]   Yeah, Netflix has all of them.
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.920]   And Blippi was filled with--
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.600]   Yeah, I started--
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.040]   So Blippi, Rich, is a site that I'm really kind of toying
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.120]   with discontinuing, records all your purchases.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.520]   And whenever you start streaming something on Netflix,
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.320]   it acts as if you've rented that movie.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.360]   So all you really saw, Justine, was I keep trying to watch "Lost."
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.120]   Yeah, no, I did the same thing too.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.640]   I mean, I don't have my credit card in Blippi,
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.440]   but I do have my iTunes account and my Netflix.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.880]   So my sister watched the entire six seasons of "Lost."
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.440]   So my entire Blippi feed was just filled with--
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.440]   I remember that.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.400]   It was your sister.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.400]   I remember that.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.760]   Was there?
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.880]   Because my big disappointment is that we can't get Netflix
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.120]   or EBC of the entire city.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:43.920]   So I thought, oh, great.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.560]   We'll go to the iPlayer because BBC
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.440]   have got a great website, which is optimized for the iPhone.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.160]   And you can go back and watch the last seven days' worth
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.040]   of BBC output.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.160]   So I'll set up this herb on the iPad.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:53.960]   It doesn't work.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.960]   It takes a special--
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.960]   Oh, no.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   Because they haven't flipped the switch
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.880]   to sense when an iPad is accessing the iPlayer,
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.720]   because obviously there shouldn't be any here in the UK.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.480]   So it's just a matter of them making sure
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.640]   that mobile so far on the iPad is recognized
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.280]   and then using the iPhone optimized versions of the shows.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.720]   Unless they're bringing out a special iPad version
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.120]   of the iPlayer, which would be fantastic.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:20.080]   But hopefully it won't be too long now.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.520]   Hmm.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.960]   You do have Spotify, which we don't have.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.480]   Yes.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.440]   Is there a--
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.480]   How long before we get Spotify on the iPad?
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.480]   Well, there is a--
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.840]   But they've just launched a new version of Spotify, actually,
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.360]   which is phenomenal, because one of the problems
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.400]   with Spotify in the past--
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.680]   I know it's only for European people at the minute--
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.480]   is that whenever I was playing Spotify music,
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.720]   I'd always be switching between iTunes and Spotify
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.920]   to sort of play my own music and then going out to Spotify,
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.520]   you know, in a sort of like party situation or something.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.800]   Well, now that you've been a Spotify,
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.120]   actually imports all your local music as well.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.800]   So it's all in a single library.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.680]   So basically, you've got all your own music, plus, you know,
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.720]   all this unlimited download of--
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.120]   well, not download, but streaming of music and Spotify.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.240]   And they've added some social aspects to it as well.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.480]   So there's integration now with other people
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.120]   that are on "Friend Feed" that you Spotify.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.040]   It's very, very neat.
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:09.040]   It's a really nice upgrade.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.080]   The best we've got here is a Rhapsody on the iPad.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.480]   And iPad is considered like a phone device.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.680]   You can only have one device.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.880]   You can have multiple-- I think three computers on Rhapsody,
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.080]   but only one phone device.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:23.400]   And it's streaming, although it will cache your playlists,
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.240]   I guess.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.520]   So you can't go offline.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.320]   There is an iPhone out for Spotify,
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.080]   which is intelligent enough to know
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:33.160]   that if you're listening to a streamed track on your iPhone,
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.800]   it will actually stop the desktop client.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.840]   So it knows that you're listening to something on the iPhone,
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.280]   so it will stop it on the desktop client,
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.400]   so you can't listen on both devices.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.320]   But the neat thing they've done now is if you have local music
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.440]   as well-- so I've got quite a large iTunes library--
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.400]   if I start listening to something on my iTunes library
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.080]   and then play a Spotify track on my iPhone,
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.360]   the Spotify and the desktop doesn't stop.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.040]   It carries on playing and vice versa as well.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.120]   So it's done some quite neat things with Spotify application.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.120]   And I think it's 10 pounds a month for the premium account.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.360]   You can get a free account as well, which is sort of unlimited
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.080]   access, but with ads stuck in this.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:08.640]   Right.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.520]   Spotify, according to CNNMoney.com, says--
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.760]   money.CNN.com says they plan to launch in the US
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.400]   by the end of the year.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.880]   But of course, you can't launch in the US
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.880]   unless Apple says you can.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.280]   You have to get by Apple.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:25.560]   But Apple let it happen in the UK, so maybe they would.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.240]   Now, Apple did kill La La this week.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.840]   Apple bought a similar service called La La.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.200]   Justine is the token hip person here.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.600]   I must not be that hip because I never--
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.240]   I buy a lot of my music on iTunes.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.240]   So anything that I want to listen to,
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.080]   I just get it on iTunes.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.600]   Although I saw somebody in the chat just
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.280]   mentioned the Dashboard iPad app.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.600]   Yeah, we'll talk about that.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.120]   Yeah, that's an interesting story too.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.400]   Because you went open source with it, which is kind of--
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.480]   but you have to be a developer to use it.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.400]   Chris Brain, OK, you may not be hip, but you're a hipster.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.560]   Did you use La La?
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:03.120]   Yeah, La La would say is another streaming service
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.480]   that what they would allow you to do is listen to one--
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.960]   listen, any track you want once all the way through.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.920]   So unlike iTunes, when you're doing a preview
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.160]   and you just get 30 seconds, and they always
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.360]   give you the best 30 seconds.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.880]   You know, never that terrible bridge in the middle
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.160]   where you go, "Oh, it's horrible."
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:20.760]   So--
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.240]   Is that--
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.360]   Yeah, are you being sarcastic or do they actually
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.400]   put the hook in there?
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.520]   No, completely being sarcastic.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.080]   It's random.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.600]   It's like the worst part, right?
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.200]   Yeah, say they put the bridge.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.440]   Here's the bridge.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.000]   Here's the bridge, like, oh, this is great.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.600]   Then you get to the rest of it, and then they have, like,
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.640]   this Elizabethan poetry thing at the beginning.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.720]   You know, where they have--
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.720]   Night in white satin.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.240]   Exactly.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.560]   Yeah, it's like 35 minutes of that.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.640]   I think, oh, God, say--
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.320]   Talk to escape across the land.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.960]   So-- and it's a remarkable the amount of Elizabethan poetry.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.280]   It was a trend in Britain in the '60s,
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.840]   and it was a bad trend, yeah.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.440]   It was very bad trend.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.560]   But so with La La, you could listen to an entire track
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.600]   and say, oh, great, there's no Elizabethan poetry,
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.440]   and that's what I will buy this now.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:10.800]   So Apple purchased La La six months ago or so.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.280]   And at the time, everybody speculated, ah,
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.240]   that means streaming is somebody coming to iTunes.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.600]   At least we'll be allowed to get our iTunes library from the cloud,
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.760]   because that's one of the things that La La did.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.840]   And then we can listen to our iTunes library on the go.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:25.520]   Sounds great.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.400]   Apple said, no, no, no.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.280]   We're just buying the engineers and the technology.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.040]   And that's it.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.480]   And that's what happened.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.600]   Yeah, and so this week, they said, no, they're done.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:36.400]   At the end of this month, we're learning.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.120]   I was really hoping they'd incorporate something like this.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.400]   Why is Apple so dead set against the--
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.160]   They may.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.400]   I mean, I'm not sure that I buy the fact that we have a lot.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.960]   They say, well, La La's got a lot of smart engineers.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.240]   There are lots and lots of smart engineers for hire.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.720]   You don't just buy a company because they
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.200]   have a smart engineer.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:53.560]   Right.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.360]   I have to think that there's going
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.640]   to be some streaming cloud component to iTunes.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.440]   I hope there is because I love subscription services
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.680]   unlike anybody else on Earth.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.480]   No, no, everybody loves it.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.720]   Like the only reason to buy a Zoom.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.280]   I mean, you get a Zoom pass and you
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.160]   can listen to anything.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.520]   You fill up your Zoom with stuff.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   It's great.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:12.920]   That is big.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.680]   No, I think so too.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.440]   So I hope that comes to iTunes.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.520]   All right, I just got to-- I'm sorry.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.720]   I have to play "Nights and Whiteset."
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.080]   And this is the iTunes preview.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.000]   I'm just curious what part of "Nights and Whiteset"
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.480]   in the iTunes preview.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.680]   With these eyes.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.280]   Oh, that's good.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.400]   That's good.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.960]   No, Elizabethan poetry.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:34.800]   No?
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.080]   No?
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.640]   They left that part out.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.880]   That's-- oh, now let's see.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.160]   That was the album version.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.320]   Let's see if the single version, what they put in there.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.240]   Same thing.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.880]   Probably have violated all the rules in the--
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.840]   Is that Prokal Harlem?
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.520]   Just a satellite, the original, that?
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.280]   No, that's Moody Blues.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.640]   Moody Blues, dude.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   We're going to yank your liver, puddly, and membership card here.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.320]   I'm sure I'm not allowed to do that.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.640]   But that was for news purposes, just to check.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.040]   And watch, because I guarantee you,
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.760]   they will sell 100 copies of that song in the next hour.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.320]   I know, I don't have it, so--
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.480]   Everybody got great song.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.640]   Everybody's going to go, oh, I forgot about that.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.240]   They're going to go buy it.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.360]   And I'm going to get sued, because somehow, in some bizarre way,
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:30.480]   I've depleted sales by playing 10 seconds.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.600]   All right, we're going to take a break while I act bitter.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.160]   We shall come back.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.120]   There is more news.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.120]   A great panel with us.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.920]   I just-- Dean, Justine Azerik is here.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.600]   I Justine.com for her great videos.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:46.080]   Find out what Kesha would be like if she got an iPad,
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.560]   because you wouldn't believe it.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.760]   You didn't have enough glitter in your hair.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.600]   I know, I didn't.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.240]   I shouldn't have washed my hair for a week.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.640]   You need more bling.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.200]   I know.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.320]   Boy bling.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.600]   Let's talk about Squarespace.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:01.160]   Actually, Don, any of you do a Squarespace blog?
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.280]   We have one-- our house blog is Squarespace.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.600]   And I'm moving the radio station to Squarespace.
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:07.840]   Don, you use Squarespace.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:13.640]   Yeah, I move the Macscreenscasky.com blog across to Squarespace.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.400]   We should be honest.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.160]   I mean, the reason that Kevin Rose, Sarah Lane,
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.280]   and I'm a callister are using Squarespace
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.760]   is because they came to all these people
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.520]   and said, well, would you like a free account, right?
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:27.440]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, actually not.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.560]   The reason I moved across was that I'd heard you talk about it.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.720]   And I had a WordPress blog.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.360]   It was on WordPress.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.320]   And my WordPress blog got hacked.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.240]   And I was really nervous about it.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.520]   It was around the time when WordPress was a bit flaky
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.680]   and there were attacks.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.800]   So I was looking for a way to move my WordPress blog off,
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.000]   WordPress, to something else.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.560]   And then I remember someone saying that probably yourself,
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.680]   that there was an import feature within Squarespace.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.080]   So I got the free account, because you
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.880]   can get a free account.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.400]   You don't even have to give the credit card, because I just
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.360]   got a free account.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.640]   I thought, well, I'll just try an export from WordPress
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.200]   and import it into Squarespace to see how that happens.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.000]   And in the afternoon, I had it all moved.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.320]   It was literally a couple of hours
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.840]   that I'd moved my entire blog into Squarespace.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.240]   So I actually paid for an account.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.680]   And I was quite happy with it.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.120]   And then I was so impressed.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.160]   I contacted the guy to inquire with not
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.440]   they wanted any screencasts doing,
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.640]   and they actually do their own screencasts.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:18.600]   So they said, no, thanks.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.600]   But you've seen as you do screencasts,
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.480]   here's a full account for you to try and--
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:24.320]   Oh, that's nice of them.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:24.760]   Oh, good.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.080]   So that was nice of them, yeah.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.640]   So I did actually pay for the--
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.960]   I signed up for the premium account,
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.560]   and they said, no, we'll let you have an account
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.960]   to try all the other features.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.440]   And yeah, I've been with them ever since.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.760]   I still need to do a bit more work.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.440]   The usual thing, you never have the time
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.240]   to play about with these things as much as you want.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.400]   But it's very, very simple to say.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.600]   Well, for something you've set up in two days,
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.400]   it's pretty good.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.320]   That's great.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.600]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.640]   You can do a personal--
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.920]   If you're into CSS or JavaScript, you can do more.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.880]   They have great templates that you can start with.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.280]   That's one of the things I really like about Squarespace
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.080]   is the starting point.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:00.880]   And the other thing I like is a lot of times,
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:05.200]   if you do a WordPress blog or a Drupal site or a lot of Joomla,
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.320]   people go, oh, yeah, I know what your engine is,
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.520]   because they all look kind of the same.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.880]   And Squarespace is not the case.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:14.600]   Every Squarespace blog is, even though they're all
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.520]   starting from the same basic templates,
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.960]   they all are incredible.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:23.360]   Go to the examples page, because it's so easy to customize,
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:26.680]   whether it's simple publishing, business style publishing
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.200]   that you want to do, or something a little more artistic,
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.520]   a lot of photographers use Squarespace.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.760]   Go to squarespace.com.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.000]   You can try it for free right now.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.400]   He's obviously a wedding photographer.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.720]   You can try it for free right now.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:43.400]   If you use a promo code MACBreak, you'll get 10% off for life.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.080]   You get the Don McAllister deal.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.240]   10%-- actually, go ahead.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.120]   What's cool about Squarespace, too, is a lot of people
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:53.360]   always want to add forums or little widgets that
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.320]   aren't maybe it's a little more difficult to do in WordPress.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.800]   But on Squarespace, it's there.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.480]   It's just instant.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.720]   It's like, oh, you want to add a forum?
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.840]   Here you go.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.040]   Hosted service.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:02.960]   It's hosted.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.520]   So they run the servers.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:08.240]   They, unlike-- to your point, Don, they update the code
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.120]   and everything.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.320]   It's always patched.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:12.400]   With WordPress, you're always going, what's the latest?
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.240]   What's the latest?
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.240]   Am I attached?
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:14.880]   Am I patched?
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.640]   They patch it automatically.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.520]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.280]   I love this because they're virtual server technology.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.680]   They just add bandwidth whenever you need it.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.920]   So it's just always there.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:26.320]   I love it.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.520]   Squarespace.com, we're going to use it more and more.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.360]   I can't wait to put the tech guy on it.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.800]   That's a big project that we're working on right now.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:37.080]   Squarespace.com use the promo code MACBreak for 10% off.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:38.920]   They start at $8 a month.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:41.640]   But when you get 10% off, you get it off for life.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:42.360]   I like that.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.120]   Squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:52.640]   So you don't buy my conspiracy theory on an HP or not.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.880]   Do you think HP is going to be able to compete against the iPad
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.520]   with a web-away-based tablet?
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.720]   Are they doing phones?
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.480]   Where are they going?
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.280]   They do make-- I was so surprised.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.080]   I thought, well, HP's been out of this smartphone business
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:04.360]   for years.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.800]   No, you could still get an IPAC--
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.720]   Windows, mobile smartphone from HP.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.040]   You poor person, you.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:13.960]   I think I'll pass on that.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.440]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.520]   But I would be very interested.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.240]   Dell's doing some really interesting stuff with Android.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.200]   I think you're going to have the big three mobile platforms.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.360]   You're going to have Android.
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.480]   You're going to have Apple, of course.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.320]   And you're going to have WebOS.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.960]   It may be Windows Phone can compete.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.000]   It looks pretty sharp.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.280]   Some of it already with the Canon.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   We're going to see more in the fall.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.800]   And Blackberry is starting to do some interesting things.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.520]   They actually put a real browser on Blackberry's now,
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.440]   instead of that crappy Blackberry browser.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.480]   So you may have five platforms.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.040]   And I think credit to Apple for not only stimulating
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.520]   the smartphone category, but creating a whole new category
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.920]   with the iPad.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.760]   And it's going to be a boom.
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.000]   I was on Twitter this week.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.360]   I talked about, are we entering a post PC era?
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.880]   I don't mean-- oh, there goes Chris Breen.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.480]   I've found him.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:00:59.980]   Why?
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.880]   I'm aerating him.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.000]   He's got to go see the blower, man.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.840]   He's going to get his hair.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.440]   His hair needs to be inflated.
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.920]   Does that-- is that kind of crazy this post PC era?
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.840]   I mean, I just see more and more people using simple mobile
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.960]   devices in lieu of PCs.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.640]   For me, I do a lot of video editing.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.520]   So the only reason that I actually use my MacBook
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.960]   or my real computer is just to edit video.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.960]   I do all of my emails, web surfing, everything on my iPad
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.200]   now.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.360]   I really didn't think that it was going
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.080]   to change my life as much as I did,
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.960]   which sounds like I'm drinking the Kool-Aid.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.440]   But it really has changed the way that I do things.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.120]   And I think it's only just going to continue to do so
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.520]   with more apps that come out.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.640]   Yeah, you still need a desktop or a notebook to write apps.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.400]   So Apple can't kill OS 10.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.320]   And for editing, which is a big business for them,
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.960]   for Photoshop, a big business for them,
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.000]   they're not going to abandon the desktop.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.240]   I just think that this is a new category that
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:59.960]   may for normal people who mostly consume content
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.840]   may be the future.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.280]   What's interesting, though, is developers themselves
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.280]   are coming on board with the iPad.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:10.360]   I follow lots of Mac developers on Twitter.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.040]   And despite what Apple had done to them
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.320]   about leaving them at a WWDC, but we can talk about that later,
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.160]   they really have embraced the iPad.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.880]   And they can see huge potential.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.960]   And it was a blog post.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.840]   Yes, they were there for us.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.080]   Fray just beers.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.000]   He'd written a blog post saying that he was out of the app store
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.440]   and he wasn't interested in developing for the iPhone.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.400]   What is Fray's--
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.800]   What does he develop?
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.360]   He's the guy who does some of the apps you plug in.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   And I think he just--
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.280]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.840]   So to upload your pictures, in fact, I think he did a--
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.800]   Yeah, he did a pick I did a while ago with that viewport.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.120]   It's right.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.440]   I knew I knew the name.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.400]   Yeah, I'll look it up.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.120]   So he's not going to do apps?
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.280]   Well, he wasn't going to do apps on the mobile platform
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.120]   because of the--
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.120]   developers were very upset at the treatment
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.080]   that we get from Apple and the whole review process.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.640]   And that's all been smoothed out now, although there's
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.440]   still some anomalies.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.480]   But basically, it's getting your app reviewed.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.240]   And it's quite quick now.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.320]   So he sort of had a change of mind
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.280]   when he sort of realized the direction that Apple were going
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.000]   and the fact that the iPad is such a huge potential.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.960]   The platform itself has such a huge potential
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.120]   that he's back on board now with developing apps
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.440]   for the Apple mobile platform, not just the iPhone,
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.640]   but the iPad as well.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:29.120]   Here's a guy who has built his iPad into his kitchen cabinet.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.240]   There's a Flickr photo set.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.400]   I saw this on the unofficial Apple web log.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.400]   He's obviously a podcast fan.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.320]   He's got Ignatian.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.360]   And maybe he just wants to get on Ignatian.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.600]   But look, he's got it mounted in there.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.000]   He's got it hooked up to a stereo
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.040]   so he can have audio coming out of it.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.080]   This is not a bad idea.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.120]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.760]   I think it's actually--
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.120]   there's his music system, right?
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.480]   Or is-- you could watch BBC News.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.880]   It was smart to hook up the speakers
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.640]   because now it's a little TV if he wants it to be,
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.320]   or an aquarium.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.200]   Pretty cool, huh?
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:00.720]   Right.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.200]   He's got an landscape orientation,
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.640]   which is hard to do with the dock because you've got the connector
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.360]   on the bottom of the thing.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.400]   I know.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.360]   Nice orientation.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.120]   Yeah, I think it's right.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.880]   I think landscape is--
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.880]   Yeah, for me.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.880]   --on the couch and notwithstanding is the right way.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.800]   But now here's a question.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.960]   And I know the answer, but it's a surprise answer.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.400]   Where does the home button go?
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.920]   Is this the proper orientation with the home button on the right?
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.400]   Or should the home button be on the left?
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.680]   He's got it on the right.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.280]   I have mine on the left.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.880]   Must admit when it's in landscape.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.920]   I did too because I'm a lefty.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.920]   I have mine on the left, too.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920]   But you know what?
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920]   I'm a lefty, too.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.360]   This is the way it's supposed to be.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.920]   Do you know how I know?
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.880]   Because we rule doesn't rotate.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.960]   That is true.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.480]   It doesn't.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.960]   It doesn't.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.120]   Justine, do you have a farm?
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:51.620]   I do.
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.960]   I kind of quit playing because I was kind of obsessed with Farmville.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.680]   And then since there's no flash on the iPad,
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.480]   I was like, I'm done.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:57.600]   I quit Farmville.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.160]   And I started playing We Rule, but--
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.120]   I like We Rule better.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.360]   It's not so compulsory as Farmville.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.920]   Plus I have a much cuter farm in We Rule.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.200]   I like the little castles.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.040]   Have you played Godfinger as well?
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.600]   It's a little less time consuming.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.800]   Well, Godfinger is one of those things where,
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.320]   unless you're constantly running it,
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.760]   you can't maintain it.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:20.800]   You have to fix everything when you get back.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.080]   Oh, I have some taxes to collect.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.480]   Continue on with the show.
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.040]   I think I've made it quite a nice little--
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.120]   I have a little river moat.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.760]   And I've got-- did you get the cauliflower yet?
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.520]   Once you can raise cauliflower, the sky's the limit.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   Well, I just got a penalty.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.120]   I had to quit playing.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.960]   Because once I get to the point that I start spending real money,
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.640]   I'm like this is--
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.800]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.880]   I will not play the games.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.680]   I won't play that game with these developers,
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.200]   where you buy all points or whatever.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:50.880]   I won't do it.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.320]   I did.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.120]   But yeah, justine, watch this.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.720]   I'm going to make justine crazy.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:00.200]   Where's the speaker?
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:05.120]   See, she's getting cold sweats.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.560]   Oh, man, I'm going to have to--
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.720]   After the show is over, I'm going to have to go back to my farm.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.280]   I've got to-- my farm needs me.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.320]   There might be cauliflower blooming.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.320]   I know.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.280]   I like the music.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.760]   The music-- I'm now completely Pavlovian.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.960]   Every time I hear the music--
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.760]   I've also known--
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.200]   It sounds a little Elizabethan to me.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:21.720]   It is.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.480]   And then, oh, you know what?
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:22.960]   It's really cool.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.000]   OK, so after that song--
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.120]   it ends, then the wind blows a little bit,
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.040]   and they have wind chimes.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.520]   It's very pleasant.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.000]   And then a guy starts talking about dragons and--
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.920]   No, they use the World of Warcraft thing
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.400]   when you touch them to go, oh, I--
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.760]   and they all have different voices.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:44.440]   And do you notice, Justine, that when you look at it,
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.600]   they look at you and wave?
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.160]   That's kind of creepy.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.680]   They're like-- they're my people.
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:51.720]   That's so funny.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.840]   But I realize, I feel like now that I got the iPad,
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.520]   like I really don't download iPhone apps as much.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.080]   Right.
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.040]   It's such a--
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:58.520]   I don't either.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.040]   No.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:06:59.560]   It's not--
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.720]   And how much do you spend on iPad apps?
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.560]   I don't want to talk about it.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.760]   I'm just mad because they're so much more expensive.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.080]   And a lot of the games that I play to my iPhone,
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:09.480]   like--
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.080]   You have to buy a game.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.840]   --smiles and plants for zombies.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.160]   Like, I bought all these games again for my iPad.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:15.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.000]   And it's such a better experience.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.360]   It is.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.520]   Plants vs. Zombies is the same exact game,
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.080]   but it's just better because it's bigger.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:23.760]   I love it.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.160]   It's terrible isn't it on the iPad,
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.200]   because I know you can blow up iPhone apps to twice the size,
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.360]   but it just doesn't seem right.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.600]   You've got to have an iPad app for it.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.200]   There's only about three iPhone apps
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.760]   that I've left on my iPad, everything else now.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.600]   You know what I still have?
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.360]   And I put it on as soon as I heard this news.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.200]   Apple bought Siri.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.720]   So I'm putting this back on, because they don't have an iPad
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.120]   version, I guess never will.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.240]   I pray that Apple did not buy this one for the engineers.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.040]   This is a great little app.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:51.840]   It is pretty cool.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.240]   I actually hadn't really tried it out.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.480]   And I just downloaded it the other day.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.560]   And I was like, this is pretty cool.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.760]   You know, I tried a ticket saying,
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.760]   I would like to find a pizza place that
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.560]   has really good pizza in San Francisco.
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.560]   And it found all of my favorite pizza shops,
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.040]   which was, I was pretty surprised.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.520]   I have a theory that the little people in We Rule
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.880]   are actually operators for Siri.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.880]   And they're really, when they go in the house,
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.040]   what they're doing is transcribing what you write,
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:14.800]   because it's too good.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.600]   You're right.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.280]   They are pretty good.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.200]   And it was quite surprised.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.160]   Natural language.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.440]   You make reservations.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.080]   You book tickets.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.920]   You find out what movies are showing.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.280]   And Apple hasn't said what they're going to do with it.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.480]   But I think it makes a lot of sense,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.800]   especially because Android phones have dictation.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.040]   And that's something that would be great
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.520]   to have a ubiquitous dictation.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.560]   I do notice that they did put a microphone
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.400]   in this iPad.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.320]   Which is great for the Glee app.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.400]   If anyone has seen that.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.000]   Are you on the Glee app too?
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:43.880]   I have it, yes.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.280]   I've never published any of my songs
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.400]   because they're terrible.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.440]   I was going to say.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.080]   The Glee app has auto-tune.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:52.720]   It does.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.880]   It's kind of fun.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.240]   Except that I'm sick of--
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.240]   well, now here, let me ask you.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.280]   Did you buy songs?
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.280]   I did.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:01.840]   I bought a few.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.360]   I got sick.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.720]   I don't want to go to rehab.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.680]   That's a good one.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.400]   I don't want to go to rehab.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.400]   Nothing.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.600]   No, no, no.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.240]   I'm going to fall down the Glee road.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.760]   Yes.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.920]   Yes.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.800]   No, don't save us, John McAllister.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.240]   Save us.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.560]   No, the voice thing with Siri.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.720]   I mean, that's the logical progression is different for Apple.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.480]   I mean, I thought they'd do more with the voice control,
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.880]   which had brought out in the last version of the iPhone OS.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.680]   Because when it works, it works great.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.160]   But it's very hit and miss at the minute.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.760]   And that's something I was expecting them
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.120]   to really build on for the next version of the iPhone.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.640]   I don't think they'll have time to incorporate the Siri thing,
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.520]   but probably for the next version after that's
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.440]   going to be part of the OS.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.000]   Sure, it must be.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:44.760]   Oh, it's five.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.720]   No, it was four.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.240]   Yes.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.000]   No, you're right.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.440]   I always hate it when these great apps get purchased
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.280]   by a big company, because no matter how much good will
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.240]   or intention they have, it always seems like it just basically
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.480]   peters out, like Lala did, like Friend Feed has
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.520]   when they got bought by Facebook.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.320]   What do you think, Chris Breen?
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.480]   Is there a chance that Siri will become a part of the iPhone OS?
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.440]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.720]   I think--
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.040]   I mean, my big vision of all this
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.240]   is that Apple eventually becomes a financial services
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:14.920]   company.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.480]   And it's all about what's around you.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.440]   No, I'm serious.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.000]   Is that the iPhone becomes money?
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.880]   Just give us your money, and you will be happy.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.600]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.440]   Oh, you mean like--
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.720]   It's going to be a payment service.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.360]   Yeah, that you land somewhere.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.160]   You walk outside your hotel, and you talk into your iPhone,
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.800]   and you say, I want to go get a pizza.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.560]   And then it shows you all the pizza places around you
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:44.520]   within 500 yards or whatever your search setup is.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.280]   You tap the place you want.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.360]   It orders the thing for you.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.800]   It pays for you because it's already done this.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.560]   So this becomes your credit card.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.040]   You walk into the place.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.080]   It's ready for you because you've already ordered it.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:55.560]   You eat it.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.640]   You don't have to have a server.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.040]   You don't have to have anybody else there.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.520]   You eat it.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.240]   You leave.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.040]   You're done.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.760]   And Apple takes-- what?
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.720]   They take a tenth of a cent per transaction.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.800]   That's a lot of money.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.000]   And why not?
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:08.880]   It's so funny.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.320]   So if you can search with voice, all the more powerful.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.080]   There was a Microsoft video.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:17.240]   One of those Bill Gates videos at Comdex many years ago.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.080]   I mean, look, everybody's wanted to do this.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.560]   And Microsoft really wanted to do this
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.040]   where Bill or somebody walks up to a Starbucks cart in Seattle
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.800]   and waves his phone.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.320]   And he gets a cup of coffee.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.560]   This is an interesting play.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.480]   And I think that that's what I travel is all about.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.360]   You're right, Chris Breen.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.160]   It's what Siri is all about.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.400]   And it's just a question of how can Apple avoid regulatory
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.440]   slapdowns, which is a shame in some ways
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.960]   that a company has to start thinking about antitrust
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.320]   action if it wants to innovate.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.800]   I mean, you could already purchase things
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.880]   with your phone in Japan.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.960]   So that's done.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.520]   It's just simply a matter of at what point
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.440]   do the financial services companies, Visa, MasterCard,
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.240]   all of them suddenly wake up and go, oh, wait.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.120]   People are using one click to purchase things.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.360]   And they're coming through us.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.880]   But what's to eventually stop them from coming through us?
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.280]   And Apple just simply saying, oh, by the way, we're Apple Inc.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.480]   And we also handle financial transactions.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.480]   So not just I ads, you do IP and pay.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.400]   I pay exactly.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.640]   IP you have a phone.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.360]   It's much more convenient than having a card
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.800]   because it's all your purchases are done wirelessly.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.800]   You just walk in and then it just becomes my minority report.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.800]   So they're pushing ads to you and you're purchasing wire.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:33.000]   We never did get smart cards here in the States.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.440]   I know in the UK, these chipped cards, credit cards are big.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.000]   This may just bypass that entirely in your phone.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.520]   Everybody's got their phone with them at all times.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.080]   We have-- I'm sure everyone's seen the square application.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.920]   The little square for your iPad or iPhone.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.160]   And I've been using that for a while.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.960]   And I mean, it's just it's insane that just this little device,
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.840]   you know, I no longer have to carry cash
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.680]   or if I want to sell a T-shirt wherever,
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.840]   I can sell someone a T-shirt just right on the spot.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.880]   And you can just wear a device.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.120]   But eliminate-- but you still need the credit card.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.800]   Eliminate the credit card now.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.880]   Yeah, that would be--
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.680]   That's the next step.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.440]   Hi, I'm here.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.840]   In fact, via Bluetooth, you don't even
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.560]   have to take the thing out of your pocket.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.360]   It just goes.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.680]   It's a little scary.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.360]   It scares me a lot.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.040]   Yeah, we have to have some way of confirming the purchase,
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.080]   don't we?
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.760]   Well, you know, what was interesting, too,
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.480]   is when I bought my new Mac Pro, I didn't realize
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.360]   that I had the Bluetooth.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.200]   I had it was on as discoverable.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.520]   So one of my neighbors in my apartment building,
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.240]   who I don't know, sent me a Facebook message saying,
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.280]   you're just a New Xerx.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:34.320]   I just wanted to let you know that your Bluetooth is on
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.280]   and you should turn it off.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.360]   Since you're a New Xer.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:36.960]   Creepy.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.080]   But thank you.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:38.960]   Creepy neighbor.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.000]   Yeah, so I think Tim too, because who knows what could have
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.800]   happened, and that's something that you just don't think.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.200]   Now I make sure my Bluetooth is not discoverable.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.680]   And I just bought it, just set it up,
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.560]   and wasn't even thinking and left for a week.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.840]   And what do you know?
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.040]   Starbucks is accepting.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.000]   The Starbucks app, it's not everywhere,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.520]   but the Starbucks app can be used at 1,000 Starbucks inside.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.160]   But you have to go inside a Target store.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.720]   I can't quite understand this.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:09.800]   But for some reason, only the Starbucks in Target stores,
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:14.200]   you can use the Starbucks app to pay for coffee.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.280]   Only in Target stores.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.720]   The kind of defeats the purpose.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.640]   I understand it.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.240]   You get it?
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.760]   It says, OK, coffee lovers can now flash Apple iPhones
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.040]   or iPod touches, or I presume iPads,
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.960]   to pay for lattes, pastries, and other items
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.480]   at more than 1,000 Starbucks locations.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.400]   They were doing it initially at the 16 company owned stores
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.440]   in Seattle and Northern California.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.360]   Now they're doing it at 1,000 to coffee shops
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.640]   inside Target stores.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.560]   I don't know why that is.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.800]   Well, maybe because Target owns those.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.520]   So I get it.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.360]   It's probably that way.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.200]   Because you can then go to one franchisee instead of 100
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.680]   or something.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:55.200]   I'm not sure.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:55.720]   I'm not sure.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.720]   I'm just testing it out for us.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.520]   I'd like Apple to be more location aware there with the iPhone.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:04.200]   So my beef always is if I go to the car that Bluetooth
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.480]   enabled, I have to switch Bluetooth on in the car.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.840]   And you always have your keypad lock on
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.760]   when you're outside of the house.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.280]   But when you come back into the house,
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.440]   you take off the keypad lock and you switch off the Bluetooth.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.240]   I'd like it just to be location aware.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.760]   It's not home, which is at these GPS coordinates.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.160]   Lock up.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.560]   Switch all this off.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.920]   Make more useful.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.920]   That's brilliant.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.920]   I tried something today, which really was cool.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.080]   I have Bluetooth audio in my car in the Ford, the Sync.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.840]   And I had the phone.
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.280]   My Android phone is the phone on Bluetooth.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.400]   I could have another device.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.200]   I had my iPad.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.160]   And I was listening to audio from my iPad.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.560]   When I get in my car now, the iPad plays music.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.280]   And the phone does phone.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.800]   So that's nice.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.960]   And with this nice new pedometer app,
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.320]   I'll know exactly how many steps I've taken.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.520]   That's really funny.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.240]   This is the world's largest pedometer app.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.800]   Takes the entire 1024x768 screen of an iPad
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.880]   to tell you how many steps you've walked.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.080]   All right, I threw that in.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.280]   I don't know why I said that.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.400]   Huge pedometer.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.520]   The Scotty Vessner, can't you with the iPad?
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.320]   Carrying your big pocket.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.680]   It's a big butt.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.280]   It's a big butt pocket.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.200]   Hey, here's some really good news for gamers.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.640]   Valve has said, you know, they've been beta.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.400]   And I wasn't able to get into the beta, but Steam for the Mac.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.200]   Steam is a really great gaming platform for the PC.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.560]   Almost all games that come out for the PCs
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.840]   are available via Steam.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.120]   You have a Steam account.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:32.960]   You buy the games.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.680]   You download them.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.680]   You have to go to the store.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.600]   Here's the cool thing.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.000]   If you've got multiple PCs with multiple Steam accounts,
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.240]   you can download that game on any of them.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.480]   Steam says that's going to work for the Mac too.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.040]   So if you have the game on a PC, it'll work on the Mac.
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.440]   The lobbies will be non-denominational Mac or PC.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.040]   You'll be able to play against PC gamers on your Mac.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.360]   And all of that now is going out of beta
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:59.320]   according to a Game of Sutra, Gama Sutra, May 12.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.120]   In just a few days, you'll be able to get Steam now.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.880]   The bad news is the only game right now is Portal.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.000]   But they say they will do same day Mac versions of games
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.360]   as they roll them out going forward.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.240]   This is huge.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.960]   This puts Mac back in the gaming platform.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.280]   And it explains why these new Mac books have such great
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:26.000]   Nvidia GPUs, much better GPUs than the Apple's
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.600]   used in the past.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.680]   I just ordered mine.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.240]   Me too.
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:31.840]   And this is why, by the way.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.000]   It's like I really don't need this, but--
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   I don't need it either.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:35.560]   I don't want it.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.800]   I'm sure I can sell my other laptop and it'll be fine.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.080]   So I'm really--
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.000]   It's my real laptop.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:39.600]   It's just doing it.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.120]   So what did you get?
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.280]   The 15, the 13?
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.640]   I got the 15 because I traveled.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.280]   And the 17 was too big, but the 15, it was good.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.600]   I really wanted a 13.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.760]   But I also really wanted a core i5 or i7.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:53.720]   I was also debating on whether to get the anti-glare screen.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.680]   I got the Glary High-Res screen.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:56.360]   I did too.
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.360]   Yeah, that's what I went with.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.360]   But I just really enjoyed the matte screen
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.400]   from my previous Macbook Pro.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:08.960]   You know who has the 15 i7 is Jammer Bee, who works for us.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.280]   And he got the high-risk screen glossy, unbelievable.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:13.840]   It looks--
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.360]   I'm glad I got with that.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.080]   It looks--
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.320]   Have you reviewed them, Chris?
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.760]   Have you looked at them?
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.840]   Macworld has looked at them.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.320]   And they're certainly faster.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.800]   I am a matte screen kind of guy.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.000]   And I haven't seen one yet.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.400]   And I want to see exactly what-- because it's not really
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.080]   matte, it's non-glossy.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.040]   And I'm not exactly sure what the difference is.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:33.480]   Oh, what is that?
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.600]   I would like to see how that looks because I'm just even
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.320]   finding my iPad too glossy in certain situations.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.960]   I took a look at the 17-inch because I
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.880]   have a theory that--
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.360]   because when I'm away--
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.440]   I mean, I don't travel that much.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.080]   When I do go away, it's normally a week,
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.400]   and I need to do video and stuff.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.880]   So I sort of realized it's on the last trip
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.840]   that I could actually get away now with the 17-inch machine.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.280]   I started off with the 17-inch machine,
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.440]   but it was too heavy.
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.280]   It was just too difficult to carry around.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.000]   But now that the iPad is there, I mean,
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.680]   that's the machine that you carry around all day.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.240]   If you go to a conference or a conference
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.480]   for a trade show or something, you
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.880]   know, you go to your hotel, your portable desktop,
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.200]   rather than your laptop, which would--
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.680]   I'm thinking of getting a 17-inch i7--
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.280]   stays at the hotel, and your iPad goes away with you.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.040]   You video on your phone or whatever,
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.080]   and then you go back to base, and then you do your post-production
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:22.360]   stuff.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.440]   So very much I see now as the laptop.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.240]   I don't need to worry about carrying the laptop.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.680]   It's going to be my hand luggage.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.480]   I wheel it onto the plane, fly to where I'm going,
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.600]   but go to the hotel.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.520]   No, I've never carried it.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.600]   It's all on wheels.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.960]   And the iPad is the portable device
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.720]   that I'll be carrying around all day to answer my emails
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.880]   and stuff, and then just use that as the main machine back
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.640]   at base.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.560]   So I'm probably going to go for the 17-inch.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.440]   And I did actually go into my local Apple shop
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.360]   and had a look at the glossy next to the anti-glare.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.520]   I always thought the anti-glare thing
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.360]   was a little bit ugly because it's not
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.480]   the complete glass around.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.160]   They have a silver bezel that goes around the outside.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.640]   And I seem to remember the very first ones that came out.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:59.840]   It looks slightly ugly.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.760]   Whether or not they've restyled it or not, I'm not sure.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.680]   But it looks fine now.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.120]   I've got no problem with the appearance of the machine.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.360]   And the anti-glare makes a huge difference.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.000]   It really does.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   It's quite a-- and I don't know how much of a difference
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.240]   it actually does make.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:16.200]   And the 17-inch shoe is so much lighter than the ones before.
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.520]   They're really thin now, aren't they?
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.720]   It is a lot lighter.
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:23.200]   So you got the 15.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.040]   I got the 15.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.640]   Don got the 17.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.240]   Well, I've got it on hold because I decided to get to BwDC
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.520]   this year, so it's sort of on hold.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.520]   OK.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.680]   Yeah, they finally announced WwDC dates
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:39.200]   as close as they could to the actual date.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.520]   Yeah, five weeks notice.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:41.240]   Yeah, crazy.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.760]   That's tough.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:47.240]   I presume that we will see any rumors about what we'll see at WwDC
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:54.520]   where we see OS 10.6 or 10.7, I guess it would be, right?
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.520]   I know we'll see iPhone 4 more about that.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.680]   Will we see the new iPhone?
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.120]   Any thoughts?
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.720]   Oh, since we already saw it.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.360]   Yeah, right.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.280]   I've before we know.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.840]   And we've seen the iPhone itself, maybe, sort of.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.280]   We don't know for sure.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.720]   They've changed the emphasis this year, haven't they?
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.600]   They really are looking solely at the mobile platform.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.080]   Yes.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.840]   Very much looking at the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.520]   The thing that disappointed me, though--
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:19.200]   and I can appreciate why they might do that.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.600]   I might need to focus all their attention on mobile for now.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.280]   They've only got limited resource.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.040]   So this year, let's focus on iPhone and iPad.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.520]   And then next year, perhaps, when
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.920]   the closer to releasing the new version of the OS,
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.200]   we'll focus more on the Mac.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.600]   But the strange thing to me was to leave the Mac developers
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.440]   out of the Apple Design Award thing.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.440]   There's only awards now for iPhone and iPad apps, not for Mac apps.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.880]   Boy, is that a strong message, huh?
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.320]   It's crazy.
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.920]   It surely wouldn't have been that difficult for them
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.920]   to include Mac applications.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.680]   I just can't understand the logic behind that.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.400]   Yes, focus on the iPhone and the iPad for the conference.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:58.400]   But to leave the Mac developers out of the Design Award,
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.800]   it seems crazy to me.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.120]   Well, it's an app world.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.120]   That's what I was saying.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.160]   We're kind of in a post-PC world.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.880]   I really think Apple still will have to sell OS 10
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.480]   and desktops.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.720]   But where's the money, right?
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.840]   Where's the money being made?
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.560]   Chris Breen, they're making it off of you on apps.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:15.360]   I saw your tweet of the top 12 grossing iPad apps.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.320]   I have purchased eight.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:19.840]   I was just counting on.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.660]   Let me see.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:25.320]   Of the top 10, I have six of the top 10.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.800]   I love it that Apple tells you what the top grossing apps are.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.600]   So you know--
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.600]   Well, I mean, it's almost a no-brainer
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.160]   that you're going to have three of them,
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.480]   because you're going to have live work.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.240]   Even though I'll never use numbers,
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.800]   I sort of feel like, well, I should have it.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.300]   Anyway.
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:38.800]   So that's number one, two, and three,
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.000]   is pages numbers keynote.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:40.440]   Right.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.160]   I did buy real racing HD, because I've done enough driving.
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:44.660]   Did that.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.440]   I got that one.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:46.200]   Scrabble for the iPad.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.160]   I bought that one too.
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.680]   I got Scrabble show people.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.160]   That's like the sample of what the iPad would do.
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.000]   It is a good demo.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.160]   Scrabble, I bought words with friends instead of Scrabble,
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.320]   because I was a cheapskate.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.080]   Log me in ignition for $30.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.520]   You didn't buy that, did you, Chris?
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.400]   No, on the tweet, I basically said,
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.320]   either I'm a cheapskate or I have no use for productivity apps
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:09.080]   that cost more than $13.99.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.640]   So it really is.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.920]   I looked through what I purchased,
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.880]   and most everything was $10 and less.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.960]   Things, I didn't buy things, but I know you did done,
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.760]   because you did a screencast on that.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.720]   Yes, I actually did buy it as well, sir.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.360]   $20.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.680]   I bought the desktop, and I kind of bugs me
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.400]   when they charge you whatever it was, $30 for desktop.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:31.480]   And then another $20 for the iPad app, it's like, come on, guys.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.640]   Let's not get too greedy here.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.440]   Plants versus zombies, yeah, I bought that.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.840]   Pinball, yeah.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.560]   I love the pinball game.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:38.480]   That's a great thing.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.560]   I just updated it, Justine, so that it does the full thing
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.440]   in portrait mode.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.520]   I just don't think it does move around anymore
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.160]   if you don't want to do it.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:48.960]   You can pinch, I guess.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.480]   I'm going to try it because I'm downloading it too.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.280]   Oh, nice.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.160]   We're multitaskers.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.840]   Omni-graffle, yeah, you got to buy.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.480]   I'll never use that.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.200]   You got to buy it, all right?
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.000]   Major League Baseball, got to buy that, even if you have baseball.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.960]   Let's skip that one.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.600]   Explain for the iPad.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.120]   So which ones didn't you buy, Chris?
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.920]   You didn't buy things, you didn't buy LogMeIn.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.680]   Right.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.920]   I didn't get explained.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.280]   I have to look at the list again to see what else is on there.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:16.880]   But it's just--
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.480]   It's sad.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.680]   Hundreds of dollars.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:21.440]   I'm sure I've spent more now on apps than I--
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.800]   I just went through and I thought, well, somehow I need this
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.000]   for work.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.160]   I need that pinball game for work.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.840]   And the driving game for work.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.560]   I know a lot, but my daughter would really love this
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.800]   because she loves plants versus zombies in the little screen.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.680]   And she would really love it in the big screen,
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.640]   even though it's exactly the same game.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.200]   Yeah, I think once you get on that roll,
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.480]   and Apple makes it pretty easy.
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.480]   It's too easy.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.080]   Yeah, well, you enter your password,
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.040]   and then you've got about three minutes for you.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.040]   It's all free.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:48.560]   It's all free.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.040]   It's all free, the next ten are free.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.520]   It's free.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.080]   Somehow it seems like, no, I'm paying money now when I'm going
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.240]   tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, but everything after that,
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.880]   for the next three minutes, it's like the red light's gone on.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.720]   And come on, you could get them all for free.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.040]   That's why I pay scares the hell out of me.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.320]   It's too easy.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.880]   But of course, that's what Amazon's doing.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:08.880]   It's what everybody's doing.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.120]   You know, I was thinking, how would you validate your purchase?
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.320]   Of course, you could take the phone out,
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.000]   and there could be a QR code on there or something like that
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   to validate the URL you say you are.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.320]   But Amazon's doing this new thing where you have two words
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.800]   that are your magic words.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.080]   And I can't figure out why they're doing it.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.920]   Now I just thought of why they're doing it.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.600]   So the clerk could say, what's your magic words?
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.120]   IP.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.720]   It's a Groucho Marx tribute.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.040]   Ah, say the magic white and everything's free for the next three
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:38.800]   minutes.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.080]   Exactly.
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.200]   All right, we're going to get our picks of the week
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.480]   in just a second.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.920]   I think we've already heard a couple of them.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.000]   Have you said mine?
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.200]   That's OK.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.120]   It's OK.
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.680]   I'm sure you could find one or two more.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.600]   Should you feel like it?
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.680]   Before we do that, though, I would
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.840]   like to do my audible pick of the week.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.200]   Audible, you know, is that great bookstore that you can go to.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.800]   And 75,000 titles, they'll read it to you
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.240]   just like mom, dear old mom used to.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.520]   And there's something about absorbing a book
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:14.000]   by listening to it that just brings it to life for me.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.120]   I'm going to give you a couple of choices.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.880]   Because we have this deal with Audible.
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.000]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak,
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.600]   where you sign up for the gold account, that's a book a month.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.560]   And the deal they make is that the first book is free.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.320]   And you get to keep it.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.240]   You can cancel it anytime.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.880]   So it really never needs to cost you anything.
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.160]   It's yours forever.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.200]   And so that's kind of really the fun thing about now,
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.240]   listening to the show and saying, well, what will my first book
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:37.400]   be?
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.000]   And there are some really good choices.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.080]   So I've got a serious one.
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.400]   And I've got a light one for you.
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.040]   Go to audible.com and browse around.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.280]   Of course, you get a credit towards a book.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.560]   Some people are very interested in Laura Bush's book.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.960]   And she talks about the car crash and everything.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.360]   And spoken from the heart.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360]   That's there.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.240]   And Laura Bush reads it.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.600]   So you're interested in politics.
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:01.720]   There's some good choices there.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.880]   I'm reading The Time Traveler's Wife, which was a movie
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.960]   that I still haven't seen, but is a wonderful kind of sci-fi
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:11.560]   book about a guy who can travel in and out of time.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.840]   There's an abridged version.
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.080]   But get the unabridged version.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.840]   It's very nicely produced.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:19.240]   Male voice for the guy and a female voice for the woman,
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:19.920]   for Claire.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.160]   So Henry's and Claire both represent it.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.880]   And it's just a really enjoyable 17 hours.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:25.880]   I've really liked it.
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:28.800]   Now that's the light book.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:31.880]   There's a very serious book that I am reading now too.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.080]   You know, I like to read one nonfiction, one fiction.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.240]   And this book is very powerful.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:43.720]   I heard about it when I heard an interview on Fresh Air with the director, Catherine
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.480]   Bigelow of Hurt Locker.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.080]   She said this was the book that inspired Hurt Locker.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.140]   It's written by Chris Hedges, who was a war correspondent through a number of wars.
[01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:57.660]   And discovered, really realized that he had become a war addict.
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:04.040]   The process of war was so seductive that it made life seem so meaningful.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.680]   He had some real issues come up about.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:07.920]   It's a fascinating book.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:11.480]   And I think a must read for everybody.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.040]   He's not a pacifist.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:16.720]   He doesn't say all war is bad, but he says, we've got to be really careful because it's
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.720]   so seductive.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.080]   War is a force that gives us meaning as the name of the book.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:26.780]   And I just found this very powerful and fascinating and I think a must read.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:29.340]   He's a very good reporter.
[01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:31.460]   Chris Hedges, war is a force that gives us meaning.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:32.460]   So there's a couple of books.
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:36.380]   So you're something serious, something not so serious, something fun.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:41.780]   And that's the point is that once you start listening to books at audible.com, life becomes
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:42.780]   enriched.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:47.100]   You hear great audio all the time as you, as you're in the car, as you're in the garden,
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.180]   as you're working out in the gym.
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:53.140]   This was where I was listening to Chris's book this morning was on the, on the, on the
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.540]   exercise bicycle, bicycle.
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:56.540]   Try it today.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:29:00.300]   Audible.com/Macbreak your first one's free.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.300]   Thank you.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:02.300]   Enjoy it.
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:05.740]   Now for our picks of the week and I'm going to go clockwise starting with Mr. Chris Breen
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.180]   in the upper left hand corner.
[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:08.180]   Hey, Chris.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:09.180]   Hello.
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.180]   Okay.
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:13.260]   So I've mentioned this already and I'll mention it again is I like the Rhapsody app.
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:14.260]   I do too.
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:16.260]   This is a new version of it.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:17.780]   It came out last week.
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:23.540]   This is Rhapsody 2.0 and the idea is that you have to sign up for a Rhapsody account.
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.820]   The least expensive option is $10 a month.
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:29.980]   And for that you get unlimited streaming of audio.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:35.420]   The audio streams are 64 kilobits per second AAC with that.
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:41.460]   You can also download anything you like onto one mobile device for that $10 account.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.420]   If you choose to, you can pay $15 a month and that gives you download privileges to
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:49.580]   three devices as well as streaming to three mobile devices.
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.660]   That's what I need to do.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:51.660]   That's what I need to do.
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:52.660]   Yeah.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:55.560]   So you put on your iPhone, you put on your iPad and you put it on your iPod touch for
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.060]   $15 a month.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:03.180]   I've been using Rhapsody for only three or four years now, mostly with my Sonosystem.
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:04.180]   And I love it.
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:07.180]   I love having access to everything.
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:11.540]   As you can see in the background, I've got a pretty significant collection.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:18.340]   But I don't care how big your music library is, it's not as big as Rhapsody's library.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:21.900]   They have 9 million Sonos tracks.
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:25.100]   And the fact that you can listen to anything you like, you can put on channels.
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:30.500]   So for example, this last weekend I was painting a bedroom and I spent two days doing it.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:36.660]   And I put on the 60s channel for a while to listen to some truly awful 60s music.
[01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:42.740]   And then I had an acoustic sunrise channel that's listening to sensitive people singing
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:45.180]   about the trench.
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:46.260]   And it's wonderful.
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:52.820]   And even though it's 64 kilobits, I had an iPhone hooked up to some audio engine 85 speakers
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:56.220]   that are like, it sounded really good, perfectly acceptable.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:01.460]   And just the variety for that little amount of money per month, I think is tremendous.
[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:05.940]   And now the fact that you can download songs you want onto an iPad, iPhone or iPod touch
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:09.380]   and take it with you is a tremendous value.
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:11.380]   Yeah, I'm such a cheapskate.
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:13.780]   I thought five bucks, well, I'm definitely doing that.
[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:16.260]   But then I found that I can only put on one device for that.
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.900]   So I thought, the music quality is good, right?
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:21.260]   I mean, it's full bandwidth, it seems like.
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:22.460]   Well, it's 64 kilobits.
[01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:23.460]   Oh, 64.
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:24.460]   Okay.
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:25.460]   Yeah, it's not 128.
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:28.580]   See, I pay for Pandora, so I get the 192 kilobits.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.580]   Right.
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:31.580]   And I have that as well through my Sonosys.
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:32.980]   But you can't choose the music.
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:33.980]   Right.
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:36.180]   And this is you can get anything you want.
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:40.340]   And you can follow artists around, you can check out people's back catalogs.
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:43.340]   If you're a music geek, it is an amazing thing.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:45.060]   I love Napster 2 for the same reason.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:48.380]   Napster is only five bucks a month, but they don't have an iPhone.
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:49.660]   But now they have an iPhone app.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.900]   Apple let them through and downloads, which I think a lot of people didn't expect would
[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:54.060]   be possible.
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.060]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.060]   All right.
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:01.860]   Thank you, Chris, bring good recommendation, Rhapsody for iPad and iPhone.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:04.820]   Moving to Justine Zarek.
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:08.260]   I already mentioned mine, but it's the pinball HV.
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:09.260]   So awesome.
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:10.860]   I don't know why this game is so fun.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:15.540]   I think for me, I mean, I think it's like a three or four dollar app, I believe.
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:18.660]   But when I was younger, I used to love playing pinball, but you know, I would only have so
[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:19.660]   many quarters.
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:22.380]   So you pay like four dollars and you have unlimited plays.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:23.700]   There's three different levels.
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:24.900]   They're both pretty fun.
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:25.900]   I don't know.
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:27.100]   I really, really like it.
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:32.380]   But there's also another app that I've been enjoying as May is mustache May, there is a
[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.740]   mustache application.
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:37.260]   It's called Stashtastic.
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:41.740]   And you can add a mustache onto any photo and there's tons of different mustaches that
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:43.180]   you can choose from.
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:44.420]   There's also little accessories.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:45.500]   You can give yourself a mullet.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:46.660]   You can give yourself different hairstyles.
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.500]   Oh, I like that.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:49.700]   It's surprisingly addicting.
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.220]   So I definitely recommend it.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:54.540]   Is it universal iPad and iPhone?
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.540]   You know what?
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:57.260]   There is an iPhone version too.
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:01.180]   But it's the official mustache app of the American mustache Institute.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:02.980]   It's pretty fun.
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:04.500]   Wow.
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.460]   So are you going to grow a mustache for mustache May?
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.820]   You know, I've been trying, but it has worked out so well.
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:13.820]   So I had to resort to the application.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:14.980]   And there's Movember too.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:18.940]   I didn't, you know, it's interesting how much mustaching is going on these days.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:19.940]   Should I grow a mustache?
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:20.940]   I don't think so.
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.940]   I don't know.
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:23.940]   Maybe.
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:25.940]   I think she'll look like a porn guy.
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:26.940]   Doesn't it?
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:27.940]   She's steady on.
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:29.540]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.500]   I'm sorry, Mr. mustache.
[01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.580]   Maybe it's just me.
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:36.340]   Maybe what does he look like with the mustache?
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:37.700]   By the way, that's George Bush.
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:38.700]   He's in retirement now.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:43.580]   He's always wanted to have a mustache and he's grown quite a quite a doozy.
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:46.300]   So you get some choices.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:50.900]   Here's a sack ephron with a beard.
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:51.900]   It's way too entertaining.
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:52.900]   It is.
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:54.900]   You can see the appeal of this.
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:57.460]   Look, this guy's got a Don McAllister.
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:58.460]   He stole your mustache.
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:01.380]   What's the Don McAllister, isn't it?
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:02.540]   It's a Don McAllister.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:06.420]   It's a small smile.
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:10.020]   I want a mullet, Anastash.
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:15.060]   Don McAllister, who is not a porn guy, he's the guy behind screencasts online.
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.220]   Despite the mustache.
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:19.980]   Have you had one all your life?
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:21.940]   Since what's seven?
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:22.940]   Wow.
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:23.940]   That's impressive.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:24.940]   No.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.900]   Yeah, sort of a beard.
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:28.740]   And then it's a goat tee.
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:31.620]   I thought you were kind of a hippie.
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:32.620]   I was a hippie.
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:33.620]   Yes.
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:36.380]   I've done him waistcoat the whole denim waistcoat.
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:37.380]   Wow.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:39.380]   Long guy.
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:40.380]   You want to see some of the other photos.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.380]   But anyway, we digress.
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:42.380]   We've got a post those.
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:43.380]   I want to see them.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:45.620]   Otherwise, we're going to have to result to the monetizer.
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:46.620]   Ooh.
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:47.620]   It's amazing.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:48.620]   It's amazing.
[01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:49.620]   That's a margin, by the way.
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.620]   They're on the right.
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:51.620]   And the monetizer.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.620]   I'm not.
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:53.620]   Am I wrong?
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.620]   I don't know.
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:55.620]   I believe that is Martin Surgeon.
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:57.060]   Yes, I believe so.
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.580]   Or somebody who looks strangely like him.
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.580]   Go ahead, Don.
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:02.580]   Right.
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:03.580]   My pick.
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:07.660]   Actually, just a quick correction about Fraser Spears application was Viewfinder.
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:08.660]   Viewfinder application.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:09.660]   I was mentioning it before.
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:10.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:11.660]   I previously chosen that as a pick.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:12.660]   Right.
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:15.260]   My pick for this week is it's not new, actually.
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:20.780]   It's a computational engine called Wolfram Alpha, which is both a web service.
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.820]   But there's also an iPhone app and an iPad app.
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:25.980]   Now, the reason I'm bringing it up again, people might have seen it when it first came
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:27.140]   out and thought it was fantastic.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:31.580]   But they actually priced the iPhone app at, I think it was around about 50 or 60 pounds.
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:32.580]   It was really expensive.
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:34.780]   And it didn't make sense because you could do it on the web for free.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:35.780]   I just didn't understand.
[01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:36.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:39.420]   So anyway, they've had a change of policy and you can actually get the app for both the
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:42.900]   iPad and also for the iPhone now for something like £1.19 or something.
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:47.340]   So they've literally priced it now in line with a normal iPhone or iPad application.
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:48.340]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:49.340]   And it's just so handy to have around.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:54.620]   Even if you're not into heavy maths or research, it's just a fantastic application.
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:36:00.060]   There's a video on the website over at wolframalpha.com, which takes you through the things it can
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.060]   do.
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:03.980]   And it basically takes sort of free form text.
[01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:07.580]   You can ask it a question, a mathematical question or a question about geography or something.
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:11.020]   And it will return the answers in the best form that it can and give you lots of different
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:12.020]   choices.
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.660]   So if you're researching things about population or growth, national product and things, that's
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:17.660]   really very clever.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:18.660]   Beautiful.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:22.620]   They can see that on the actual iPad app itself, they've done a great implementation.
[01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:24.100]   Really, really nice.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.980]   I'm going to buy it right now because I didn't realize it had gotten cheap again.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:27.980]   That's awesome.
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:33.780]   What is the advantage of the iPad app over say using the web?
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.540]   It's just such a nice presentation.
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.860]   Just really is pretty.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:40.860]   And they built in an extended keyboard.
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:41.860]   In fact, I've got mine here.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:45.660]   Now, if I show you the keyboard to this, let's just tap in here.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:49.060]   So you sort of get the, I don't know if you can see it probably here, probably not.
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:50.060]   It's probably bright.
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:54.460]   You get the standard keyboard at the bottom and then some additional keys at the top,
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:56.860]   which are sort of like scientific and generic.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:37:01.700]   But if you tap on more, you actually get, like, look at all those rows of people's.
[01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:02.700]   Oh, look at that.
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:03.700]   There's buttons and stuff.
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:07.100]   So if you're a student and you want mathematical words.
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:08.620]   It's fantastic for students.
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:09.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:10.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:13.380]   But not just physics and statistics.
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:17.980]   Just say geographic information, even, I mean, dumb things like, you know, I always struggle
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:18.980]   with percentages.
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:20.740]   I just type in 25% of 343.
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:23.900]   It comes out and it just, you know, just type in the sentence and it gives you the answer.
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:27.180]   So it's, it's a great little act to, especially for that price now.
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:30.740]   I didn't show and I should show your pick.
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.100]   I just seen this is the new.
[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:33.580]   I just got the new one.
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:36.780]   Now they said if you pinch, because this is the problem with, you know, if you do it
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:38.940]   this way, you get to see the whole machine.
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:41.060]   This is giving us a tour of the machine.
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.060]   Which one's your favorite?
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:43.060]   The deep?
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:44.060]   The deep one?
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.060]   The deep ocean?
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:46.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.060]   Okay.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:49.380]   So let's, let's look at, oh, now I have to, what did it do?
[01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:50.380]   It took me out of it.
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:51.540]   Oh, I think it's taken you to the site.
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:52.540]   Why does it take me to the store?
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:53.540]   I don't want that.
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:54.540]   Let's play the game.
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:57.980]   It's kind of a weird interface because to switch from, this is the actual, the game
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:01.140]   that I was talking about with you, you tap in the left hand corner.
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:02.500]   That's how you pause the game.
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.500]   I didn't know that.
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.340]   Yeah, it's weird.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:07.220]   Let's ignore that.
[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:08.220]   Okay.
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:09.220]   So there's the jungle.
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:10.220]   Stop.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:12.060]   But now see, I want to, am I locked?
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.060]   I'm locked.
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:14.060]   Okay.
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:17.300]   So that's the problem was it, as you play, it zooms around a lot.
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.540]   And that kind of, I felt like I was going to have a seizure.
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:23.740]   Apparently they said now if you, you can pinch, oh, yeah.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:27.180]   It's a little insane.
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.420]   But it's really fun if you like pinball.
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:32.140]   So I have to find the new user interface.
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:33.140]   Okay.
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.140]   Enough of that.
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.140]   Stop.
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:39.500]   Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:45.100]   Well now I was going to mention pinball as my pick or perhaps, no, no, no, we rule.
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:46.100]   Well, that's a problem.
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:47.620]   There's so many great games.
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:49.580]   Have you played Galcon fusion yet?
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:50.580]   Haven't.
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:51.820]   This is a fun one.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:54.300]   Robert Scobel son Patrick turned me on to this one.
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.020]   It's a puzzle game.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:59.900]   So we'll restart with a new game.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.380]   So I'm green and the bad guys are red.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:06.060]   And I have to take over planets before they do.
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:07.660]   So you do them by invading them.
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:09.420]   But see they're invading planets.
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:10.740]   These are neutral planets.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.540]   And eventually we're going to have a war.
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:17.020]   You can double tap, tap all your planets invade a planet.
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:18.020]   They're coming for me.
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:19.020]   They're coming for me.
[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.300]   It's a little bit like playing Ender's game for reels.
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.100]   Oh no, the bad guys.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.580]   Oh, they're around.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:26.660]   Oh my goodness, the humanity.
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:31.020]   So it's a lot of fun and there are a variety of different puzzles you can play with this.
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:34.500]   This is called a Galcon.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.060]   I'm sorry I'm a little distracted.
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:37.260]   I don't want to lose my planets.
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:38.620]   All right, I'll stop playing.
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.540]   This is called Galcon Fusion.
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:43.380]   That's a lot of fun.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:45.660]   You can see I have quite a few games on here.
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:47.780]   And I am downloading the now that Wolfram Alpha.
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:51.740]   So that'll be a new game for me to play.
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:55.380]   We'll just give you a little view of this now that I got it loaded on here.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:55.740]   You're right.
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:40:02.940]   If you tilt it just right, it's actually a pretty lit legible screen, Don.
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.580]   You can actually shoot the screen pretty well.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:06.500]   And so this is the extra rows of buttons.
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.700]   And if you tap more, you see.
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:12.100]   There's still a little room, a little tiny bit of room up there.
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:15.580]   I like using Microsoft Word with all the toolbars turned on.
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:18.580]   That's really cool.
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:19.580]   Look at all these symbols.
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:21.580]   I don't even know what most of them mean.
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:22.580]   Same here.
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:23.580]   Wow.
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:31.300]   Man, woman, birth, death, infinity equals Ben Casey.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:32.300]   Wow.
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:36.860]   That is a joke that no one except us old farts will get.
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:41.660]   Actually, if you use the, is it the elements application?
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:43.180]   Elements as it built in too.
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:44.180]   Yeah.
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:47.460]   But it's not the same though, because it's only about that particular.
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:48.460]   Sure.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:49.460]   Yeah.
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:50.460]   That's right.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:51.460]   It just brings back the information about that particular element.
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.020]   But let's check out the website.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:54.020]   Check out the website.
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:55.980]   There's a great video on there from the guy who actually invented it.
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:57.860]   He showed us some of the examples.
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:58.860]   Stephen Wolfram.
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:00.620]   You know, when this launched, I interviewed Stephen.
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:01.620]   Oh, that's right.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:02.620]   I remember that.
[01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:03.820]   What a treat that was.
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:07.660]   I should dredge that up because he's so brilliant.
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:12.340]   And I think one of the tricks with Wolfram Alpha is just understanding, you know, kind
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:14.860]   of using it enough so that you kind of get what to search for.
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:17.900]   Because when you first start searching for stuff with it, it doesn't make any, you know,
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:19.500]   it's like you have to, it's not Google.
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:20.500]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:22.660]   You have to kind of know what to do.
[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:23.660]   Thank you, Don, for being here.
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:24.660]   Really appreciate it.
[01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:27.620]   Don McAllister is the hosted screencasts online.
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:31.460]   They have plenty of free screencasts, but you can also subscribe.
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:35.180]   We encourage you to do so because there's a whole bunch of paid material too.
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:38.180]   He's got that freemium service that he uses.
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:40.740]   And I think it's a really useful site.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:41.740]   Screencast.
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:43.660]   Can I just book my other blog?
[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:44.660]   Yes.
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:47.700]   Screencast online.com, which is the, which is my main site.
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:48.700]   That's my day job.
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:50.060]   That's why I do the video tutorial.
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:55.060]   So I've just started a Tumblr blog all to do with the iPad because again, I don't want
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:58.380]   to cram the iPad down people's throats, especially over here in the UK and Europe when we start
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:41:59.380]   with it.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:00.380]   Right.
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:01.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:05.940]   Split off a separate little blog called all about the iPad dot tumbler dot com.
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:10.780]   And in there, I'm just putting some videos up, some information, just basically musings
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:12.300]   and ramblings about the iPad.
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:15.380]   Don, you'll have to be part of our iPad show.
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:16.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:17.380]   Love to.
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:18.900]   We'll have to do a view across the pond or something.
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:20.900]   By the way, that was another thing I was going to mention.
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:25.220]   Dropbox now has a Dropbox updated to a universal application.
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:31.060]   If your Dropbox customer, really fantastic, really much, it makes Dropbox a must have now,
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.060]   I think.
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:33.060]   Yeah.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.060]   Great to get files onto the iPad.
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:38.860]   But see, I learned that from my first iPad video, which is how to take the iPad out of
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:41.940]   its case, which is on it.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:47.220]   I think, you know, we laugh, but Virginia, that 99 year old needs some help probably getting
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:48.220]   it out of the case.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:49.220]   Now she's got a video.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.780]   I struggled with it initially, but it's a little easy way to get it out of the track.
[01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:54.780]   Oh, there's a track.
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:55.780]   I see.
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:56.780]   I feel like I'm going to rip it.
[01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:42:58.780]   I don't use the Apple case.
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:42:59.780]   I hate the Apple case.
[01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:00.780]   I lose.
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:01.780]   Oh, I love the Apple case.
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:02.780]   No, it's great.
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:03.780]   I like it a lot.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.260]   As long as you don't mind it being a big groupie now.
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:06.260]   How about, look at this case.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:07.260]   I'm going to show you this case.
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:09.260]   I got to get the camera going here.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:10.260]   Hold on a second.
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.780]   This is the Marware Eco View case.
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:14.540]   I have the Apple case.
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:15.540]   I bought them.
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:16.540]   It's leather.
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:17.540]   It doesn't have an Apple logo.
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:19.500]   You can't tell that something.
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:23.860]   It's got a little moleskine rubber band, so it holds it nice and tight.
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:27.100]   It's using the same technique that Apple uses, except this is nice leather.
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:32.180]   It's only $10 more than the Apple case to hold it in the frame method, which I like.
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:36.060]   The thing that's key about the Apple, of course, is the ability to stand it up.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:37.060]   This has that.
[01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:38.060]   It does it a little bit differently.
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:41.420]   It has a little stand built in, but it does a very nice job.
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:45.220]   I believe you shouldn't get a case that doesn't have a stand because you do want it tilted
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:46.220]   at an angle.
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.500]   It's sturdy enough that you can type at that angle.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:50.180]   This also has something unusual.
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:52.900]   I think it's designed for the factory floor or something.
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:56.460]   It's got a strap that you can put your hand in and hold the iPad one hand.
[01:43:56.460 --> 01:44:02.220]   You see, I use it to hold a cleaning cloth because that's another thing you need.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:05.140]   This is the Eco View from Marware.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.540]   This is my favorite case.
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:12.020]   Similar to the Apple case and functionality, but it's leather instead of rubber.
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.940]   Have you seen the Dodo cases?
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:14.940]   No.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:15.940]   There are handmade...
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:18.580]   I just saw these last night, actually.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.860]   It looks just like the most skinny notebooks.
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:24.420]   It has the bound, hardback cases.
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:28.300]   It looks really cool when it's made of bamboo and I think leather as well.
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:29.300]   I did see that.
[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:30.300]   We have it really nice.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:32.340]   Somebody sent me a link to that.
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:33.340]   Have you bought one yet?
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:37.180]   I'm thinking about it, but I'm not sure if it would be heavier because it's made of
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:38.180]   bamboo.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.260]   Bamboo is a very light wood, W.
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:43.940]   I mean, the Apple case itself though is so light, I feel like it's not.
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:45.580]   You don't have anything on it.
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.180]   The Apple case is kind of like being naked, isn't it?
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:50.380]   But this one looks like I do like cases.
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:51.380]   It's pretty.
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:52.380]   Isn't that pretty?
[01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:53.380]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:55.140]   Really nicely done.
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:58.340]   There's going to be a brisk market in iPad cases.
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:00.220]   There's no doubt about that.
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:01.460]   So what is it?
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:03.020]   All about iPads.com?
[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:04.020]   All about the iPad.com.
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:05.020]   All about the iPad.com.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:06.020]   All about the iPad.com.
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:07.020]   Totally.
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:08.020]   Good.
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:11.020]   And Don, we'll make sure that you are a regular on our iPad show.
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:13.020]   I'm really excited about that.
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.660]   Christine Azerik, I think you will be too.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:16.340]   Any iPad fanatic should be.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:17.940]   I'm a big fan.
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:20.260]   Justine is iJustine.com.
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:23.060]   That's the place to go to find out about everything she's doing, anything particularly
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:24.940]   you'd like to plug today?
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:25.940]   Not much.
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:30.620]   Just check out my blog and watch my YouTube videos if you're bored.
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:31.620]   That's the hard sell.
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.020]   Thank you, Justine.
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:34.780]   Always great to see you.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:35.780]   Thanks for being here.
[01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:36.780]   Thank you.
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:39.260]   Chris Breen is the MacDaddy senior editor for Macworld.
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.360]   Go to Macworld.com.
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:42.060]   I know that much.
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.340]   He's also a talented musician.
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:45.100]   You got any gigs coming up?
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:49.100]   Yeah, actually we're going to be in Golden Gate Park.
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:50.100]   Oh, neat.
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:53.740]   I think May 31st for some kind of Zen festival or something.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:54.740]   Oh, that was fun.
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:56.580]   Yeah, in the band shell, it should be a lot of fun.
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:57.580]   Oh, that's really neat.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:58.580]   So that's probably a fantastic band.
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:00.260]   Yeah, in the band is System 9.
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:01.500]   System 9 from Outer Space.
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:04.380]   Oh, no, that's a movie.
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:05.380]   Chris is great to have you.
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:06.380]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:07.380]   We appreciate it.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:08.380]   Always great to be here.
[01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:09.380]   Take care.
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:10.380]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.380]   Don't forget you can watch us do this show.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:12.820]   I got squeezed.
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:17.940]   We do it live every Tuesday at about 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:21.020]   That's 1800 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:22.740]   But to subscribe, it's the best way to get it.
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:26.740]   Either in iTunes or whatever other podcast aggregator you use.
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:30.700]   Just search for Twit or go to our webpage, twit.tv.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:35.100]   And we have a subscribe button on the show, twit.tv/mbw.
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:36.660]   There's a lot of other good shows there.
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:41.340]   I have a feeling people watch their favorite show and forget that Twit is about Twit.
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:42.940]   There's 20 different shows.
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:45.020]   We do a good show on Google these days.
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:47.260]   We do it every Wednesday afternoon.
[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:51.580]   This week in Google with the great Gina Trapani of Life Hacker and Jeff Jarvis, author of
[01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:52.580]   What Would Google Do.
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:56.860]   If you're interested in Google and the cloud and what Google's up to, that's a really
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:57.860]   great show.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.620]   So I want to give that one a little plug too.
[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:02.900]   That's at twit.tv if you want to know more.
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:04.060]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:05.060]   Now get back to work.
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:08.540]   Break time is over.
[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:13.580]   This is Mac Break Weekly, Episode 193, for May 4th, 2010.
