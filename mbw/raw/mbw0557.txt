[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.680]   Rene Richie's here from imore.com
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.440]   He's warming up his fingers. He's doing the stretching exercises. There will be typing this afternoon
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.560]   It's not a holiday quarter or an iPhone launch. So it's gonna be doomed Leo. It's just a question of how doomed
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.280]   It should be easy. It should be easy doomed as doomed can be you know how many words you think a hundred words hundred thousand words
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.080]   Quarter a million iPhones a year a million iPads there as soon as real money
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.720]   And I can also hear from the Chicago Sun times. He's not on deadline
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.880]   Or are you I'm always on deadline, baby the world keeps spinning even as I keep tripping
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.760]   Did either of you you're on East Coast time. So it wasn't as early as it was for me. I got up at 5 a.m
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.160]   To to cover at 6 30 a.m. Our time
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:43.680]   Microsoft's announcement in New York City of a new version of Windows an interesting version of Windows Windows 10 s
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.600]   The S stands for simple series series
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.400]   stands for schools and for students speed security safety
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.560]   But interestingly, okay, so this is something my Apple could follow in their footsteps remember when Apple started the Apple store and
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.840]   As you know encouraged you buy apps there. I was a little perturbed. I was worried
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.160]   I was upset. I thought this is the beginning of the end. They're gonna make you buy all your apps there
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.400]   They're gonna keep the app store updated and they never did they didn't it wasn't a problem
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.080]   They have gatekeeper which says
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.760]   You can only you know you could turn on gatekeeper and I imagine schools might do that you can only get apps from the app store
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.120]   But but it's up to the user because it's a desktop operating system
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.360]   Well, Microsoft's Windows 10 s is almost identical to Windows 10 in every respect except
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.640]   You could only get apps from the app store and there's no really no way to turn that off. That's
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.400]   What it is is you can upgrade
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.280]   50 for 50 bucks you can upgrade it to regular Windows Windows 10 Pro so yeah, actually if you buy one of Microsoft's new surfaces
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.000]   We'll talk about that in a second. It's free to upgrade it through the end of the year. So if in effect
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.620]   You don't have to have Windows 10 s but schools might be interested in that because it you know limits what kids can
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.240]   The trouble kids can get into I think right I think actually it's more than a school operating system
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.800]   And in fact when they announced the hardware to go with it
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.040]   They announced they have seven vendors a sir a sous delf which it's a HP
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.960]   Samsung and Toshiba will all make Windows 10 s laptops for education starting at $189. These are essentially
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.080]   Chromebooks running Windows 10
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.200]   You know, I have to streamly dinner stripped down checks, right?
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.120]   Which means that they're perfectly fine for whatever you want the what do you want to call the the four R's to be not only for
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.400]   schooling but also for like personal computing like people a lot of the stuff that I use my PED Pro for
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.360]   It really is just I need a web browser. I need to write lots of words
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.560]   I need to go on Twitter and goof off a little bit
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.680]   And a lot of these things can be handled very well with a Chromebook the cost 200 bucks or a $300 notebook
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.720]   But yeah, this this really is just laser focused on education
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:07.400]   Acer introduced among among the carpet bombing of press releases that was in my inbox that one second passed the time
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   They were allowed to actually post
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.680]   Acer has a
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.860]   Things like $200 and obviously education focused machine
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.860]   It's only bought by like
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.920]   Educate by education and it's it's designed to be drop proof. It has a chick like keyboard
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   But that means that they they were very
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.280]   They're very specific saying that you could put it could be you could pour as much as 11 ounces of liquid
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.720]   Into this keyboard and gutters would channel it away. I know I worryingly that is one ounce less than a 12 ounce can of soda
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   So I don't know if you
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.000]   So so long as you make a half-hearted attempt to grab the can after you after you dump it onto the keyboard
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.680]   It will still be okay, but yeah, it could it couldn't be more clear that this is this is the idea of let's create something that
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.320]   No school system is going to want to say no to
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.100]   The other parts of press releases. It's designed so that you can easily rack mount it
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.400]   This Acer is also a 360 degree convertible
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   So you can use it as a tablet you can use it to stand it up and play a video. It has HD video 1080p
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.760]   It's interesting and it basically
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.400]   makes a tough world for Apple to sell iPads to schools in to bring it back to Apple
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.320]   It's it's funny. I think we totally buried the lead though that Joe Bell if you already now has blonde hair
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.080]   But I didn't see Joe do was Joe there he was tweeting from outside the venue
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.240]   Oh his hair is always a big deal outside venue. This was really though
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.840]   I you know we had bought who was joining me for this stream pointed out. This is really Joe's
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.000]   Thing he took a year sabbatical after Windows 10 came out and spent it teaching traveling and teaching his kids and
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.040]   Education has become his thing. He's now in charge of education and Microsoft's so I really did expect to see Joe on stage
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   Instead, we saw CEO such a no della
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:00.880]   Followed by Terry Myerson who's the senior vice president for Windows and then a stream of various presenters presenters and teachers
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.320]   and educators demonstrating
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.840]   The thing this is chose this is Joe's baby
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.600]   I think was that interesting though that mean like you could say you know last time that came for the creatives
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.240]   And I didn't worry too much because I had a nice new Macbook Pro now. They're coming for the education market
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.820]   Well, that's why I'm bringing this up because and and Mac break weekly because obviously, you know you guys
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.320]   I'm sure don't say oh who we don't want to hear about Windows, but
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.200]   Microsoft did ship new or announce new hardware which won't ship for six weeks
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.760]   They call it the surface laptop and on the surface it might look like an education machine
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:47.000]   But it starts at 9.99 not education priced. Yeah, and I think this is more than a this is a two and three-quarter pound
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.280]   high res 10 point touch
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.520]   No pen included, but you can use the pen with it device that is not just aimed at schools
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.000]   but aimed at executives and actually a
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.720]   fashionable colors aimed
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.120]   Squarely at Apple they even compared it to Apple in terms of battery life. It's got a real
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.400]   It this looks like the Macbook. It's a little heavier than the Macbook, but it's got a real processor the I5 or the I7
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   KB or to seventh generation not not the older one it has
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:23.520]   You know admittedly a strip down operating system, although I think there are people including executives
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:31.680]   Just normal people who would probably like 10s. It's kind of midway between a Chromebook which is you know highly locked down
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:38.840]   You can flip it if you don't so it's not even a new clip it. Yeah, the the education version is gonna have a free version of
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.720]   Of Minecraft and mine, you know a bunch of stuff. They're doing a bunch of tools for education
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.480]   So they're really aggressively pushing education, but I think I
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.040]   Think if you're an Apple person you've got to look at this and say
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.520]   Gosh, this might be the laptop. I wish Apple had made
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.080]   It's priced like an iPad air
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.120]   It's like a Macbook air and it's got a retina display and it looks like a Macbook air and it's got a retina display
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.440]   And and it's got the colors of a Macbook which don't come with the with the bigger models
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.800]   It's really no you just have to what you have to bite the bullet and say well
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.440]   I'm willing am I willing to buy a Windows 10 device instead of a Mac OS device, but I
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.520]   You know, I mean I've ordered one I ordered the burgundy one and we'll have it
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.720]   But we don't have until June 15th the colors are pretty
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:33.320]   The you know, they offer an i7 version with 16 gigs of RAM. They don't go more than that anymore than Apple does
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:43.240]   512 gig SSD. I don't know a lot about the SSD. You do not see my screen Carsten. Okay. I don't know a lot about the SSD
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   We have some some specs here
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.360]   But I do think that this is I
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.840]   Think they're what do you think are some Apple people gonna look at this look at the video?
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.160]   I mean was was you know straight out of?
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160]   Apple's Apple's play book. Sorry
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.480]   Straight out of Apple's playbook. This actually isn't the the video
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.080]   I wanted to show they showed a video of it being put together
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.640]   You know that with all with the exploring parts and stuff that really was straight out Apple playbook
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.840]   They're going after Apple. I mean it's really smart working you
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.720]   Here we go
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.800]   This is this is a this is a very apple
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.520]   Down of the music
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.880]   So you speak the language that people you want to talk to wait until they pronounce aluminum and they'll lock it in
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.080]   Note the i7 right up front they show an i7
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.800]   Poor m is not a great processor
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:47.120]   Interestingly though, they're doing the buckling very similar keys the switches to the Apple laptop and Andy
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   I'll be very interested to see how that
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.200]   Have similar platform and physical constraints, so they're gonna have to do right similar platform. This is interesting
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.400]   They use al-kantara, which is a poly fiber
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.000]   For the surface not the keyboard but underneath the keyboard. Yeah, that certainly makes it distinct
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.840]   But I I don't know how that'll wear
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.040]   Say it feels very comfortable and warm
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:17.440]   Well, find out I mean it might it might wear like leather meaning that you can tell that as what they say it on antiques rocho good
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.040]   Honest where that actually gives it a patina or it could
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.720]   Make you wish that you had decided not to use this right after a 10 mile bike ride. Yeah
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:33.840]   You know, I mean in terms of specs. It's got a standard USB port not no type C on this and no USB C
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.440]   It's got a type a yeah
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:41.360]   It's also got a mini one type a mini display port and they're all doubling down on the surface port which
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   You know if you have other surfaces, it's gonna you know, which I do the dock and and
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.840]   You know the
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.280]   It is I mean, it's a big version of type C
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.040]   I mean you can you know when I put the dock on it. I got ethernet. I got
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:07.560]   US you know USB 3 I've got you know a dock the basic idea to make it make it trivially easy to take a laptop
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:13.360]   That is deleted a lot of ports and essentially turn it into a functional desktop without having to plug in a whole bunch of things
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.680]   Or having to buy like a $400 Thunderbolt brick for it. So there's a it's it's an
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.680]   interesting
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.400]   Place it really really I think that Microsoft
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.640]   They're definitely taking some lessons from Apple
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:31.040]   But I think they're also taking some lessons from Google where they so they're saying that it's we're doing great
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.800]   We got like 80 something percent of the desktop market
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.560]   By letting everybody all these manufacturers do whatever they want
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:43.920]   But we think that we really need to develop the Microsoft brand not just as like this power outlet
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:50.360]   That's at the desk at you at the desk at your office that you don't think about and turn it into something that there's gonna
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.360]   Be at least one brand that is a desirable
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:58.360]   Object where I don't I don't want to get if when I go when I take my job at this new company
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.360]   And they try to give me like an Acer laptop or a Samsung laptop
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:06.320]   No, no, you're gonna you're gonna as part of the deal you're gonna get me a surface notebook
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.000]   So that people see that I'm a I'm a man of taste and breeding and character
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.880]   Who wants the finest things in life and that's I think part of why they've they've been
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:22.920]   Pushing the surface brand even when you have this $999 laptop that runs what might be incorrectly
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.680]   What would might be say it said as the as the second-class version of Windows?
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:32.840]   Realize that it's still premium build. It's still designed so that you're not sacrificing all that much
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.080]   I think that this one is designed to be a transition between
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.120]   Like someone who went through high school being issued
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.080]   Window Windows notebooks and now wants to buy something for college and or got it
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.760]   Someone's gonna buy something for them for college or they've decided hey, I'm gonna be $700,000 in debt
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.440]   What's another thousand dollars of debt?
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.200]   They want to take something with them to school that has a little bit of style about it
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.240]   And they don't want a gaming laptop it includes a year of office
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.360]   365 and now they've put office 365 in the windows store
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.840]   This is not the same as the tablet version that you get on the iPad. This is somewhat different
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.800]   I and I haven't played with it. I haven't played with any of this but
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.600]   They're saying that it's not that the things that have to be necessarily rewritten for the Windows store
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.720]   But you if for instance if Google wants to have Chrome
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.680]   Use on this laptop they will have to put a version of Chrome in the store
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.960]   Which just like doing things with the Apple store means that there are terms and conditions
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.080]   You're going to have to adhere to and how you build your apps
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.240]   So this hope maybe if this would be a good thing for Microsoft
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.720]   It will sort of encourage developers to move a little bit out of the wild wild west and into the compound
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.520]   Where there are rules to how we expect apps to behave?
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.600]   And they do sorry any can they do third-party rendering engines in the windows store because they can't do that on they show
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.840]   Photoshop they say Photoshop is
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.840]   I mean for like Chrome could they put
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:15:00.640]   Yeah, Microsoft rules right now there is only one browser on ten s and that's edge Microsoft some browser no third-party browsers
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.680]   But again, I don't think there is restrictive
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:09.640]   But I'm not sure they may not be the other thing missing is steam and one of the reasons people buy Windows machines is to play games
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.720]   That that's game new and Val was very perturbed by the Windows store
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.080]   He said this is Microsoft's attempt to shut down third-party gaming everybody laughed at him at the time
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   But that might be a little bit more true now. That's certainly like Microsoft just doesn't have that power over their own plan
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.040]   No, and they don't think they want to they want a diverse platform. I think you inhaled it Andy
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.920]   This is a reference design much like the Google Pixel
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.140]   To show what you could do at the high end and certainly not the education machine
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.400]   Yeah, it's on install reinstall
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.240]   Now it's interesting because
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:51.800]   From now through the end of the year you not only get a free version of Office 365 for one year from now through the end of the year
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.240]   If you buy one of these you get a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.240]   so
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   They're they're they're saying
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.520]   This is a real
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.480]   Gap in the laptops. Yeah, cuz they had the surface book which I own but it's ungainly
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.280]   It's top-heavy because of the way it's designed. So it's not really great in the lap
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.920]   They didn't really have a laptop plenty of other people are making Windows laptops. They didn't have a laptop
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:25.280]   So that's why they're calling the surface laptop it fits in between right convertible that they make the tablet the surface pro the surface book
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:31.880]   Which is a laptop with a detachable screen. This is just a regular. This is this is a lot like the Mac book
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:38.360]   Exactly, that's I think that's what they're doing with the surface brand if people don't if people are saying correctly that
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.600]   Versus your your levelable
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.120]   Your levelable desktop over there is not like the best seller in the world
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.680]   It's not necessarily designed to be the best out in the world's done design to you about the service studio
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:54.440]   I'm using sorry. Yes, the studio is designed or it's designed to say that look if you see something with the surface
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.720]   That's being sold under the surface brand you at least want to take a look at it because it's going to be different and interesting
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.040]   but this just as the
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:08.000]   The surface book last year it was really interesting because it's not just here
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.840]   You can detach the screen and it becomes it's not only is it a regular touchscreen machine
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.160]   But it also actually detach the screen it has its own battery
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.200]   It has its own CPU and get this super super super slim
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:25.800]   Tablet machine that still runs windows, but it's also leaving behind in the base with the keyboard in the trackpad
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.160]   It's leaving behind the GPU and other things that are really really power hungry
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.360]   So that this can still have a really good battery life
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.280]   That's obviously comes with a lot of trade-offs as you mentioned
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.000]   But it's something that Microsoft can make and say hey
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.200]   Here's some things you can do with windows that will distinguish it from the commodity machines that most people are buying
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:49.360]   It's and the fact that they're not only giving you an easy upgrade path from 10s to
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.400]   Actual windows pro and also saying look no we will give you a screw the 50 bucks
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.440]   We will give it to you if you wanted it's it's clear that this is not just a prop a pet project
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.040]   It's not just hey wouldn't it be nice. They really are trying to make people from again people who?
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.800]   I think most windows uses right now
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.920]   They land at the airport they go to the rental car counter and they get the car that it's issued to them
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.560]   And they drive that car without feeling very much about it
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:24.000]   They're really trying to build a generation of Windows fans of people who especially kids who are going to grow up with Windows machines
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.240]   Grow up with hopefully cool Windows machines and
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.480]   When they're looked at when they're looking at a Linux machine
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:36.320]   They'll saying well god, but this why would I want something that's this hard and like I don't I want to I can't use the
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.880]   Commercial apps that I have to pay a lot of money for but I want those commercial apps that pay a lot of money for or they'll look at
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.440]   Max and they'll say yeah, but this keyboard really sucks. I mean it really
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:54.880]   It's a clown exploding bad keyboard. Why would I want this? Well because it's more secure and because oh, I don't I just want the nice keep
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:01.440]   You know, it's you want to make a generation of people who are gonna have active resistance against switching from Windows
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.920]   That was funny funnily enough Apple strategy for years. They gave away Apple to computers
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.000]   Your generation
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.400]   Renee grew up with Apple two computers in school every computer lab. Yeah, and
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.560]   And I think that that was a very smart move. I don't know why Apple abandoned it
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.600]   Google has been eating everybody's lunch with their Chromebooks in the last couple of years
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:28.440]   This is Microsoft's all hands-on deck response and I have to say I think it's a very good response
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.680]   They have you know, if you watch the videos that they showed they have a very good solution for
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.800]   administrators in schools to make it easy to set these up. They're offering a version of their in-tune
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.800]   enterprise pro you know administration tool for
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.360]   education they're
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.680]   doing a version of their
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.120]   Slack competitor Microsoft teams
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:57.120]   They're doing teams for education and I think that is brilliant. Yeah, that's that's part
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.680]   That's part of you think way off 365 for free for a year because there's a lot of it's
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.440]   On shows like this and in columns we like to argue about well
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.200]   What about this technology makes it better than the other or what features is this delivering that other people's aren't the other
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:17.440]   Solutions aren't going to get but unfortunately really is what came pre-installed on the machine or what what was I went when I
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.680]   During the 15 minute or half hour process in which I unboxed and set up this computer
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.600]   Was there a box that said oh by the way choose a password and you'll have this this office suite
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:34.240]   For entire year for free you are not going to be going out and looking for third-party apps because it works fine
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.240]   It's not there's nothing wrong with it
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.960]   Google Docs is not the it's not the greatest suite in the world, but it works fine
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.120]   It's free. It's what people are being taught in schools
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:47.320]   And so you really need to push them into a better app even if it is a better app for imagine
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.560]   They've got Microsoft Office for free a lot of schools use PowerPoint schools that might be tempted to use Google
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.400]   Google's apps or now have access free to the Microsoft apps
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.120]   This is I think and by the way
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:04.840]   And let me ask you guys this is this the laptop?
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.760]   Apple should have made is this what their MacBook Air should have been or even the MacBook Pro?
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:16.880]   This I mean now did now they have I think lapped Apple twice with touch devices this surface studio
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.560]   Which I have to say touch works beautifully on and now a laptop Apple said time and time again
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.000]   We're not gonna do touch we don't believe in touch so Microsoft says yeah, well we're gonna do it
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.040]   Go ahead for now, sorry. Yeah, I mean I think that we're still in the age of of compromises all around like this is a
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:42.760]   Is a really great laptop is essentially a MacBook Air with a retina display that does touch but it's missing USB-C and better battery life
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.280]   And yeah, I mean I don't know the MacBook Air has got pretty great battery life
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.040]   But getting a retina display in there with good battery life is a really good accomplishment
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.100]   And it's you know, it's running on the latest processor is it's not running on it's
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:58.840]   And it doesn't have USB-C which seems like Microsoft could throw one of those in there
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.240]   There's always there's always sort of something with these that doesn't give you everything that you want
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.680]   Otherwise we don't have nothing to complain about fair enough my big problem with all this
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:14.120]   Increasingly going forward I mean it's not fun to have a computer that now is okay because it's got a single USB-A port
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.880]   But in two years everything is USB-C and now you're using dongles again like you bought a MacBook Pro
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.480]   So I mean it's it's a good to have it be nice that these companies had some sort of balance
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.520]   Like just give me one give me one old port one new port
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.920]   I'll be happy for both, you know for a couple years to come
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.040]   But my bigger concern is you know Apple
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:34.400]   Famously give away software because it makes so much money on hardware Google escalated by giving away hardware and software because they make so much
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.040]   On services and Microsoft is an old company trying to reinvent themselves
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.120]   But we saw palms start to give away things that are lost and we don't have palm anymore
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:47.840]   So I just hope that Microsoft has a strategy to actually keep making money and being a solvent company and growing company on the back
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.200]   Of trying to compete with Google who can afford literally afford to give away all
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.480]   Well, I hope Microsoft has a strategy to make money
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.880]   You're always you're always one step away from it. I mean admittedly they don't have a quarter of a trillion dollars in the bank
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.120]   But they're doing all right everyone is doing all right until they're not that's my biggest fear
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.600]   I mean Apple's doing all right until they're not and if you start if you decide to compete with Google on price
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.120]   You've got to make sure that you know first you you create a generation for whom price is the only feature and Google is really good
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.240]   at competing with companies for whom price is the only feature and then you also train people not to want to spend money on stuff
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.600]   And you've got to have an engine that allows you to be solvent when people aren't spending money in a traditional way
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.440]   And again Google is a past master at doing all this
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.640]   They are making credible amounts of money
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.480]   So does Facebook without having to sell any atoms or any bits
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:39.360]   But not everyone is is is good at doing that and I think Microsoft has really good traditional office and enterprise and server businesses
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.360]   But that's very different than the consumer market
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.120]   well
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:51.240]   The the problems the the problems there are that it's not as though people always want the cheapest and they always want something that's free
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.440]   They want to get the best value and sometimes there really is that sweet spot of
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.560]   Again is Google Docs the best has the best word processor ever made certainly not but it's good enough
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.200]   So that most people can use it for a long long time before they feel as though they're hidden their head
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:13.440]   On the ceiling of what they can do with this app a lot of a lot of things that laptops that are in the
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:21.240]   That run windows they are also there's some really terrible ones that I really wish the people would ban from their house as they would
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.760]   ban trans fats because they're just terrible if they break it they break in about five or six months
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.000]   But nonetheless there there's a sweet spot of 500 bucks where
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.640]   Even when I test these things as I'm wrapping it up and sending it back to manufacturer at the end of my period
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.760]   I'm like why am I why do I always just automatically spend?
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:44.520]   $100 on a new laptop when this there are very there very few things I can't do with this really dirt cheap one
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.640]   That's well made and has all kinds of ports on it
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.000]   So it's so I agree that you always have to have a plan to keep making money, but
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.440]   Microsoft has
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:00.240]   Has air support they got sea support they got land they got ground forces with with windows
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.800]   It's still 82 83 percent of the desktop market might even be a little bit larger than that depends on how you cook the numbers
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:13.200]   So so long as you can keep people and companies and schools using software that at some point requires a
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:20.000]   licensing fee to be paid by someone to Microsoft they're gonna do pretty well and this the
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:28.760]   Strength of they haven't I think that we need we can start to steer the conversation about Microsoft's trajectory
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.920]   Away from trying to reinvent themselves to know they've done it
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.500]   They are they they they rolled the dice saying that no we don't think that
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.320]   laptops and desktops are gonna be trending downward and going eventually going away
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.960]   We think that they're going to be affected by multi touch but then find its own level because or get we think there
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:54.600]   Is always gonna be things that desktops and laptops can do that multi touch devices can't so we are going to build hybrid devices
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:00.960]   So that not only can someone build a build a phone out of this or a tablet out of this or a laptop out of this
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:06.600]   They can build a laptop that takes some of the best features of a tablet or tablet that takes some of the best features of laptop
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.200]   And as I've said before it really is starting to look that Apple
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:18.440]   Bet on the wrong horse here. I really think that I don't think I will never I will never let the phrase what Apple should be doing
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.800]   Escape my lips except for in a mocking tone as it's doing right now
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.400]   but I really I
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:34.520]   I'm looking forward to seeing if Apple either has a way to remind us why keeping multi touch screens are separate from
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.840]   laptops desktops and
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.600]   mobile devices is still the best way to go and
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.080]   Tell me why a
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:50.160]   Generation of people who once again the first computer they pick up is going to be a device that has a touch screen on it
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.200]   How they're going to continue to get these people to want to buy max?
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   Instead of buying an iPod or excuse me an iPad or an iPhone and never really caught into any other computer
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.960]   It's a question mark in my mind. That's all I'm saying
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:10.520]   What does Apple do in education now? Do they just give up with two strong competitors and Microsoft?
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:16.240]   They haven't they haven't shown any ability any look at the iPad you look at the iPad in this
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.200]   It's I if I were an educator I would say not gonna buy an iPad to expense
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.240]   It's it's it's well
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.960]   It's tempting because when you talk about the the reason introduction the price dropped to 329 bucks
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.320]   That's getting close to what schools can support for to buy per seat for for a student
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:38.720]   However, it doesn't come matched with the software that they need it doesn't certainly doesn't come matched with the administration tools
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.080]   They need again
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.800]   It's it's really is a computer you buy for that you're buying a
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:51.720]   500 copies of for a school system is such a different beast than something you're buying two or three of for your household or
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.880]   Ten of your company. It is no it is really no no accident that Acer said by the way
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:03.280]   Here's how much liquid a stupid kid can pour into this keyboard before you run into a problem
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.920]   Here's how far he can drop it before he can brother
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.240]   Another advantage for Microsoft there is a much more heterogeneous
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:15.080]   Group of OEMs that can make a variety of different sizes shapes styles and price points
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:21.360]   Which makes this very desirable Microsoft has put together a software package and a concept
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:27.400]   Yeah, and then they're saying you guys run with it and I think that that I mean Apple doesn't have that you know luxury
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.920]   I'm sorry. I was just gonna say that I think Andy is right that Apple has focused in on iPad
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:37.600]   Especially the new iPad fifth generation for schools and they're pairing that with a large a tech deal
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.800]   So if you buy them you can buy the pallets of them basically where you get a bunch of iPads
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.760]   I'll discounted price with a bunch of large tech keyboards that are matched to them at a discounted price
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.160]   And then they have the new
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:53.000]   Phasor spears is under really good job documenting all this they have a bunch of new tools where teachers can push things to students and pull things back
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.600]   And they've just rebranded iTunes you and all their Apple stuff is Apple education and they're pushing the teachers project
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.840]   Okay across you know it just came into Canada
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:06.760]   There's a lot of curriculum on iPad lot. I mean, you know Pearson and a lot of apps for students. Yeah
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.360]   But that's but that's that's also one of the problems
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:15.120]   They don't in many school systems. They don't have the they don't have the ability to choose an iPad until they
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.760]   They go back to their school board and saying yes, I know that we are not allowed to buy computers
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:25.960]   I do not have anything at port. However, here's the reason why we don't think that's important and why we want to buy an iPad instead
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:33.920]   It basically adds another thing to the another brick in the backpack of somebody who really wants to put iPads in the school system
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.840]   Whereas there's so much flexibility in the window side of things
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.000]   I'm not saying this is right or wrong
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.160]   But this is just the way the world is if the state of California decided that added
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.000]   Some tweaks to here's here
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.280]   We don't think that our technology and school system project is really working right now
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.320]   We are gonna add these two or three features to the core curriculum. You could have a company
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.600]   Company like Acer say great. We are good because that's a huge market
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:04.040]   We were actually going to create the California edition it comes with avocado and the prototyping board area
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:09.020]   That the school system requires of all computers that they buy because that's how many we're gonna sell
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:15.400]   The difficulty with Apple is not that they can't create hey, we've got this great iTunes U system
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.920]   It's like yeah, no, no has Apple has to be iTunes me iTunes my school system
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.440]   You don't try to sell me on your new system
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.760]   You you you you convince me that I tell you what I need for my operation
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:37.120]   It's really really hard for I don't think that Apple has created for itself a culture that says that we're gonna start to make
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:44.560]   Computer that we don't necessarily want to make that that doesn't really inspire us that doesn't we don't think is part of the future
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:50.960]   That is a wonderful and aspirational thing it delivers things as even as simple as as the earpods
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.440]   That is not a product of a company that's trying to make a $50 pair of Bluetooth earbuds
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.800]   They're trying to make something truly great. They need to create a culture of
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:05.960]   They they need to create a used auto dealership a really good used auto dealership that knows how to take knows how to go to the auto
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.000]   Auction saying that great
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.520]   This is we can sell a million cars that cost five five thousand dollars and has it have at least 50,000 good miles on them
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.360]   That's how we're gonna make our business Apple is not a company that wants to do that
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:23.720]   They want to make the hover car that flies itself and sells you movies while you're while you're traveling
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.640]   I have to say there is a killer app that Microsoft has that Apple does not and that is
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:34.520]   Minecraft for education and they are offering this you know this this acquisition
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:40.640]   3.2 billion I think it was is looking smarter and smarter and smarter for Microsoft
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:47.320]   It not only is the game still extremely popular for maybe kids from 10 to 15
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:55.860]   But it also with they now have this code builder which means that you can you can teach kids math
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.240]   programming you can really
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.320]   Do a good job of using something that the kids already love and they demonstrated using tinker
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:10.640]   To have it, you know one of the things you do in Minecraft is a lot of mining and it gets tedious
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.640]   And so you tell the kid will write an automated mining machine and tinker. Oh, I could do that
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.400]   Yeah, you could let it run all night. Oh, I could do that
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.920]   That's talk about incentive to learn how to program. Oh
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.880]   My god, I want to do it. It'll be Bitcoin Leo. So it'll be
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.000]   I mean, I this is this is
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:39.200]   Even if you didn't have any other educational leg up. This is big. This is huge. I think I'm glad that that remains a century later
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.520]   A core American value find a way to get little kids into the mining industry
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.880]   Forget coal miners. I got minecraft mining
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.480]   No, but I mean if you want to if you want to teach coding and increasingly I think coding belongs in the math curriculum as well
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.320]   You go to where the kids are go to where the kids are and I can't imagine a single kid
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.160]   That wouldn't be thrilled to play with this and it comes with this thing
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.000]   Microsoft smart too because they did avoid the netbook a little bit by making this high end
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.640]   uh laptop
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   So that you can ace her and all the rest of it
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   There will be netbooks. There will be crap
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.120]   189 dollars. What could you make?
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.960]   But it won't be from microsoft microsoft showing look you can make a good one
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.320]   Yeah, but schools we understand you're on a budget. So we're gonna give you a choice
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.720]   uh
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   Last question then we'll move on
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.200]   Is it can we now say that?
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.600]   Touch belongs on the desktop or
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.960]   Is is apple right?
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:41.840]   I've I've already said it. I I think that apple is a either living money on the table or they're letting the bus take off without them
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:47.680]   I think that they really need to figure out a way to either enhance ios so that it becomes more
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.920]   Excuse me. So they can sell not not so that it ruins existing iPads
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.760]   But so that hey look how much we've added on to this wonderful building we call ios we've now created
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:05.280]   uh new apis and new hardware specs for here's how you make an ios based laptop or they find a way to say that yeah,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.240]   I you know how
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.320]   Mac OS the interface has looked a little bit stodgy and a little bit old well
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.560]   That's because we have been always working on
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.040]   Mac OS emoji
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.280]   It's it's so in the future. We can't even put a number on it has to be
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:25.680]   High-asking number of a of a smiley face and that's how different this is and yes, it does incorporate multi-touch
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:33.200]   That's what i'm hoping. Yeah, well, we might find out wwdc is just a few weeks away. That's apples. It's a month away. It's apples chance to uh
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.520]   I mean
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.440]   None of these things are done in a month, but one hopes apple has a response
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.080]   It's a broader question too. It's like not just his multi-nurship along the desktop
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.600]   But does it belong on computing and as Andy said people are growing up just using touch
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.520]   It's a de facto interaction model for them
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.440]   And I think the desktop paradigm starts to go away because none of these things are strictly desktop anymore
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.000]   You pull off the keyboard you use it on your lap you flip it upside down and turn it around you use it while you're standing
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.840]   We're living in an age where all those boundaries those are those sort of artificial technologically constrained boundaries are falling by the wayside
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:08.720]   And apple is sort of it's funny to say but it's sort of unlucky here because google grew up their business from a touch generation era
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:13.600]   They didn't have a legacy computer business and microsoft did but their mobile operating system didn't do very well
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:20.160]   If if windows phone had been as successful windows mobile had been as successful as ios was maybe they'd be facing a similar conundrum
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:25.520]   But they they had to go all in on windows and they it really hurt them for a while with windows eight and they came through the other side
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.800]   And now they're doing extremely well and apple had huge success with ios which makes it hard to want to invest
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.400]   Considerable time and money and making os 10 or back os touch friendly
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:40.160]   But now they have to devote that energy into ios because you're going to be like like caught in the middle if you're not
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.800]   And there just has to be something after both of these things when computers really are no longer segmented
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.320]   Between mobile and desktop that has a better answer than what we have from apple today
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:54.000]   Jc lon in the chat room. I think says it nicely. It's nice to have the choice
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.520]   Yeah, and when you don't like it. Don't use it. You don't have to use touch, but it's sure nice to have it there
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.040]   And yeah, I think they've proven that you can make a beautiful machine
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.360]   with a touch screen
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.240]   Yeah, that that's just to finish it off. That's uh, that's the core of my
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:17.280]   Disquietness with apple because the option to the option for mac is well. Just don't buy a mac like yeah, but I want to buy a mac
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:23.760]   I like max i always use max. They're great. It's like but but but like, okay, if you want if you want a standard usb port
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.160]   You're welcome to switch to windows whereas if you're in windows, it's like oh man
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.200]   This isn't this new laptop doesn't have usb c. Well, I guess i'll buy one of a hundred hundred laptops
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.480]   It will get the job done for me to have you that have usb c and usb 3
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   I
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:44.560]   Hope I hope it'll still work for apple or maybe their long form game plan is we think that we can be
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:51.360]   We can express our appleness and not necessarily always being a desktop manufacturer or even a mobile manufacturer
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:57.040]   We want to create the software that heals the world which in other any other company you would think is a silly
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.720]   Thing that the new ceo says as he's counting the days until if I make it if I don't get far until this date
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.760]   I get my emailing a dollar boaters and I can buy my own rock concert with apple you're thinking that no no
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.680]   We think that we we we see the writing on the wall. We can't make $50 phones
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:19.200]   We can't make $500 laptop. So we're going to transform ourselves into a company that can do good and express our creativity without having to do those things
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:25.840]   All right taking a break more to come apple has a quarter of a trillion dollars in the bank
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.680]   For apple there's so much trouble with this new microsoft
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.680]   It's your long lost relative for today. I'm just I need to borrow some money
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.880]   I hear there's an igerian prince who could help you get that money rene
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:42.160]   Actually the apple quarterly results come out later today. We'll give you a preview of that
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:50.720]   And uh some bad news for the apple watch a couple of big companies are pulling their apple watch apps maybe perhaps perhaps
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   Our show today brought to you by wordpress. I confess
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.600]   You know, I've been using wordpress for a decade
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.520]   And I confess I was seduced
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.400]   By a pretty young thing and sure I had a little fling
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:11.680]   With some other system, but i'm back, baby. And i'm so happy. I love wordpress
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.800]   For a long time. I was hosting my own wordpress blog and one of the things I got tired of was keeping it up to date
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:23.680]   Dye wordpress.com. They host it. I don't have to i'm i'm no longer enamored to the idea of running my own
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:31.360]   Server they keep it up to date. They give you so much capability. Here's my new site leola port.com

[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:52.400]   Uh, it's pulling in my feeds from instagram and twitter and good reads and I mean
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.280]   It's just ready to go and the commenting system, but you know what I found which I had forgotten
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:04.160]   wordpress.com has a huge community around it. So I get follows I get lots of traffic

[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.760]   But if like me you're a long time wordpress user you could sure dig under the hood
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:29.040]   And uh and and play with it and and have a lot of fun. It's just a great solution

[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.600]   slash mac break
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.320]   This is not your grandpa's wordpress. You by the way
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:49.200]   Very easy to import my grandpa had a wordpress. It's right. Well, he had a letterpress. It's close
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.440]   It was born in a log blog wordpress that he built with his own two hands
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:59.200]   Uh, it was really easy to export all my content and just suck it right up into a wordpress
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.080]   Which is a lot of big tech sites run off wordpress. Yeah, you know, I was I was very every time we talk about it
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:10.080]   People will say oh, yeah, we use wordpresses or cms. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's it. Yeah, it's power
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:15.120]   You were just showing nine to five mac that's running off wordpress. Yeah, the chicago sun times works off a wordpress
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:20.400]   I do all like it. It's pretty darn good my own and my personal site runs off a wordpress
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.000]   Which means that when it comes time to archive my stuff. I just simply cut copy based. Yep
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.640]   And incidentally, it's really nice to be back on uh, um, Daniel jalkaets mars edit. Yes the best
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.600]   Mac desktop client for blogging
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.040]   And I was frustrated because I couldn't use it because well I
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.240]   WordPress has a very well-known api that works just great
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.160]   You can use it with the blogger too
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.720]   And i'm using uh mars edit with this new micro dot blog and it pipes right into my wordpress
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:55.440]   I mean, that's the advantage you have of having a a system that's been around for years. Yeah, everybody supports it
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:02.160]   It's just awesome again. It's it's about choice no matter what you want to do with a blog or or just the the
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:08.560]   vague concept of i've got ideas in my brain that I want to put onto
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.480]   internet, please
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   You can articulate that so easy
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.280]   Have to be the person who hits the bug first
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.040]   Yeah
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:22.880]   Thorett dot com runs on wordpress. Yep, you know paul is using it. Um, anyway, thank you. We're glad i'm sorry
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.880]   I had that fling with that other one
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:30.560]   She's forgiven me. I'm sure wordpress.com slash mac break. It's good to be back
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:39.360]   Uh, let's see. Let's let's will i give you some good news a quarter of a billion dollars in the bank
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:46.640]   Uh, that's that we won't know exactly but that's expected to be the number announced in just about an hour, right?
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.480]   Yeah, and that's after all this by backs and the dividends
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:56.720]   Everything else they've been doing to reduce that amount and there is a chance that uh, president trump will let them repatriate for 10
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.680]   Uh that i'm team's going i'm giving it away leo, but it keeps growing i keep giving it away and it keeps growing
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.280]   I didn't realize but this did happen once before in
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.720]   2004 there was an amnesty under bush
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:15.840]   And companies were able to bring their cash and they you know google microsoft and apple many companies
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:22.160]   Uh end up transferring intellectual property assets in this case. It's apples transferred to apple ireland
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.640]   So they pay royalties to apple ireland even on stuff sold in the us
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:34.160]   The idea being let's let's let's earn that money where the tax rate is much lower in fact for a while ireland had zero tax rate
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:40.560]   I think it's still uh pretty low and uh not the high corporate tax rate, uh in the united states
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:47.520]   Um, but it also means you can't use that money in the us and and apples actually had to borrow it against it for some of the stock buyback
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:56.000]   But is it makes it a quarter of a billion dollars is kind of an un i mean a quarter of a trillion dollars is kind of an unimaginable number
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:02.560]   Yeah, that's it's the the cool thing about that is that okay, so we we we spent the first
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:07.920]   The first act of this show talking about or excuse me in my case talking about how gee I really wish that apple
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:13.920]   I hope apple's not making the wrong bets or with that amount of money that means that if they decide that oh damn it
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.440]   You know what?
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.480]   Gosh darn it. We really should have invested in multi-tux and the desktop
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.200]   Well, I guess we're gonna have to spend 75 billion dollars to own that entire company
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:29.200]   That's doing nothing but developing desktop multi-touch and now they can get they can get spun up on pretty much any direction
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.200]   They want to take the company in a couple of years simply by saying that thank you
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.320]   Thank you and your other 130 employees for working on this problem for the past 12 years
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.080]   We would like to own the brain simply line up in front of the can opener
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:49.440]   We have the ice cream scoop ready. You will be you will be very very happy here at apple to give you an idea of how much a quarter of a trillion
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.200]   Is it's it's greater than the market value of walmart
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.320]   It's greater than the market value of proctor and gamble
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:02.000]   It exceeds the foreign currency reserves held by the united kingdom and canada combined
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.560]   Combined now not all of it is overseas, but uh 90 percent of it is uh overseas
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.560]   um
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.920]   They've doubled that cash in just four and a half
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:19.360]   Years and I guess there's two ways to look at it and you you know you you make a point
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.720]   Well, they have a lot of money to spend if they need needed to but the other way to look at it is why haven't they spent this money?
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   Why haven't they been investing more aggressively?
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.080]   Uh in technologies that could help move them forward
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:36.480]   Yeah, there also might get some pressure from shareholders say well you should now be paying now that you've repatriated all this money
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.840]   Why don't you start paying big big dividend? Well, that's what's gonna happen
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.080]   It ends up in fact. That's what happened in 2004
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:48.160]   Very little of it went to hiring more employees or r&d almost all of it went to stock buybacks
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.120]   And that's probably what apple will do and dividends. Oh, but they have to buy twitter and netflix
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.120]   I mean
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.960]   Would buy twitter
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.960]   I'm this close to suing twitter by the way
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.960]   Because I don't know if apple want that headache because yeah, so just apple i'm warning you you'll get the papers because
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.760]   uh, you know we trade mart sweat long before twitter trade even existed
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:15.360]   And I I you know I I sent a note to ev and i waleam's the founder. I said why did you name it twitter?
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.840]   He said well, I didn't think either one of us would become big
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.960]   Uh, and and I was a little miffed
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.480]   And then we sent it then we actually had our lawyers right to their lawyers and they said well no problem because we're going
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.280]   We're never going to get in your business. Our trademark is in streaming content on the internet
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   And they said we're always going to be a micro blogging platform whenever getting your business. Well now here we are
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:43.920]   Twitter's about to launch a 24/7 live streaming channel with technology news on it and among other things
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:50.480]   I'm this close. I'm talking to our lawyers this afternoon because it's the problem is people assume
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.760]   That we're copying them which drives me their nuts
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.480]   Anyway, it's that that's neither here nor there
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.160]   uh
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.960]   But apple if you wanted to buy twitter
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:05.360]   And us by twitter by accident take it in my accident
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.880]   Oh it was twitter. We thought it was twitter. Oh
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:14.160]   Oh, you keep that you keep that billion. We don't need it. Yeah, that billy. That's fine. We don't need that
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:20.240]   uh apple's uh cash exceeds any company in recent history. It's unusual
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.240]   Uh, in fact, uh, the journal quoted a professor at warden
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:31.120]   Donald trump's alma mater who said i've never seen a company in this kind of extreme position barring a winding down in other words
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.440]   selling off of assets
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.520]   Um, iphone says you're welcome. It's is it all iphone?
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.280]   It's mostly i mean was it 90?
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:46.240]   It 80 to 90 profits hard to remember that it was in 1997 that apple was this close
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:52.080]   Just a few million dollars short of going out of business going bankrupt
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.560]   It's a depression ira company leo just like our parents
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.840]   That's why they're saving all this money
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:03.200]   We remember what i don't want to ever get that close again you kids these days you with your fancy companies
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.240]   here's a great graph. This is the graph from the wall street journal of
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:13.040]   The cash being amassed the uh the blue is amounts head by held in uh the foreign series
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:18.000]   That's awesome. Yeah carl icon takes a stake large calls for big buyback
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.040]   So it's just i mean it's a pretty steady state of growth
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:28.320]   But the big bumps, you know, it really starts taking off as you say with the iphone and the big bumps start in 2011 2012
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.920]   2013
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.680]   And it's it's just growing at this point. I wonder i mean some of that's got to be interest right
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.600]   Or or investments and i mean as much as we as people talk about ipad not growing or or don't
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:45.120]   Or wonder about apple watch profits. They're still contributing billions to that bottom line every quarter as well and it all adds up apple
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:50.240]   Does buy companies but they don't spend a lot of money the biggest acquisitions the three billion dollar beats acquisition
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:56.000]   Um, I feel like they need that this is an opera the money does nobody any good just sit in there
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.120]   It's an opportunity for apple to do something
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:06.000]   Well, we didn't believe it would happen. Remember like it apples buying piece. What are they doing? I still think that was a bad idea
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.040]   But all right no, but I mean like comes out of nowhere and they could announce some major acquisition next week
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.040]   That's true wait or this after apple wise disney
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.360]   Yeah, they just had to keep the money around until the deal was my own life
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.320]   Well, but you'd have to ask and I think it's not unreasonable say well what would why would how would disney enhance apple
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:26.160]   Or any kind of any really fishing. Well, no, that's what i'm saying is yeah, what would you buy that would enhance apple? I don't know
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.120]   the entire
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:34.400]   Yeah, I don't even think we're need to show there. I think that if like when I was talking a
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.160]   A couple of weeks ago about how apple can you get a chip?
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:44.000]   That they simply said okay guess what we're not buying we are designing our own chips for everything from now on
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.200]   They could really just buy a middling
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.240]   Manufacturing concern in china own it
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.920]   Buy all of their by their entire supply chain by their entire
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   Manufacturing line and simply say that we never have to buy a chip that is not singly purpose-built not just for the mac or not
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.840]   Just for the iPad but for this specific iPad or this specific mac
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:11.920]   It's there's so much stuff they could do if they decide if they if they decided that we're going to basically take two or three years in which we're
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.160]   Okay with not being the shiniest the shiniest
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.000]   The best boy in all of pep atlan or whatever
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.480]   We can just basically say three years in which we're going to continue to make really good iPads iPhones and Macs
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.800]   but we're really just sort of
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.840]   Moving into the new facility and we're really
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.360]   Reinventing ourselves so that three years later when we
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:39.280]   Do the dramatic unveiling where the apple logo is now going to be in six colors once again?
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.920]   Uh, we'll realize oh wait a minute. They're
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.200]   They have they have their own energy production plant. They're growing their own crops
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.960]   They are they're encouraging all of their employees to interbreed as opposed to date outside of the company
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:51:00.640]   And they could they're mining there or they have their own mines for or they are now essentially their own country for all of their independence
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.080]   Uh, and that would not necessarily be the worst thing for them to happen for them
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:10.320]   Just buy a amd and then build the warp engines for the spaceship campus already. I mean none of that stuff is cheaply. Yeah, you know, I mean
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.560]   We talk about
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.400]   The old days and intel
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.520]   Intel's really struggling right now and uh in fact
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:23.120]   They just announced that there was a bug in their management module a module everybody hates
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.520]   Uh because it was kind of this close source lump that we didn't know what it was doing
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.760]   And now it turns out it was it had an exploit in it. It was it was a buggy
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:35.120]   I have to I feel like intel suffering. I mean maybe apple
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:41.280]   Maybe apple does, you know start doing all their own chips and start making all their own stuff
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.720]   Why not on the supply chain. I've talked about it. There's 20 letters left in the alphabet Leo
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:47.600]   Uh
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:54.640]   All right, let's see here. It's uh what 130 about an hour and 15 minutes. They will send out an email, right?
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.960]   That's the that's how it all begins. It hits the wires
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.640]   Yeah, I think they legally have to make it hit the wires first at the close of the market
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.960]   And then is there an analyst call it to this afternoon? Yes five p.m. Your time
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:11.120]   Uh, so we're gonna by the way, we got to get rid of rina in about a half an hour because he's got a he's got a limber up
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   He's he's still on the loop
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:20.080]   His finger exercises in an hour. I'm good until quarter after I loved uh this article in the axios
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:26.480]   Talking about what to expect from eena freed. She says she's waiting for what i'm looking for
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:32.640]   The one sentence and it seems like in every analyst call there's there's one line apple
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.680]   Says like tv is a hobby
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.600]   That everybody's years go whoa, what did you say?
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.840]   Uh, it lately it's been we're all in on ar
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.160]   Are you are you looking for what are you what are you looking for?
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.520]   Renee uh
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.200]   Yeah, so I think this again. This is not a holiday quarter. It's not a new iphone announcement quarter
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:01.760]   Uh, this is typically the quarter where I think apple is going to be pressed on things like ai in ar and tim cook has proven strangely
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.120]   Verbal
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.520]   Verbal the opposite of secret when it comes to ar
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:11.200]   Typically apple won't discuss future looking plans but cook has said four or five times already that apple apple is incredibly intrigued
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:16.560]   And think there's a big future in ar so I think he's going to continue sort of tease that thread because a it's nebulous enough
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.440]   That doesn't pin apple down because ar could be like screens a ubiquitous technology and not a specific product
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.440]   But b it sends analysts and media types starting for headlines, which gets them off his back
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.600]   So it's almost like a double whammy from cook at this point the word you're looking for is loquacious
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.000]   He's been loquacious
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.560]   Yeah, it's not verbose but loquacious
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:41.920]   Uh, open uncharacterously open about in his in his charming southern
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:45.360]   But but I have to say I don't think anything tim does is not carefully
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:50.400]   Thought out. There's always a strategy. He doesn't let things slip unless he has a man
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.200]   This is hilarious
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:57.040]   But as strad- i've helped serenity called well do her awesome transcription several times now for the apple call and transcribing tim cook
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:01.760]   Is incredibly easy. I had to transcribe elon musk at one of their recent calls
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.240]   Very discursive. It was so difficult
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:09.840]   But what I think is like tim cook is not only well spoken, but I think like you exactly said he is brilliant
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.280]   He has almost little recall and he knows exactly what he wants to say
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:18.640]   Yeah, he does not like as eena says that one sentence that's not a slip. There's always
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.760]   You know that if there is a sense she thinks it might be something about cars
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:31.680]   Um, yeah, yeah, I don't think car is an apples future. I don't I don't I don't think talk about cars helps apple
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:38.720]   I think talk about vr helps apple particularly given how apps is someone dropped a match down zucker burbs
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:44.080]   But about vr that was all about that that was his entire thing about vr
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.440]   Excuse me in his uh his own like, you know facebook
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:53.680]   A sermon to developers a couple weeks ago and it's all people have been writing about about facebook for the past couple of weeks that he's
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.440]   a
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:01.600]   Doubling down if not quite drooping down on vr and facebook and also maybe running for president because he's doing a
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:06.080]   Lot of things that are really dopey for billionaires to do unless they think they have a political future
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:11.200]   Uh, but but but I don't I don't think that tim cook is going to talk anything about running for president
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:15.840]   I think he's going to want to at least address that particularly given that he was very open to do to acknowledging
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.240]   vr in previous statements
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.200]   You see that you're gonna drop in you weren't expecting that where you dalings
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.440]   You know, I did a drop in just a little drop in
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:28.400]   Expectations here's fast companies article by mark solivan on what this you know
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.840]   They always talk about beat the street. Well, here's what the street expects
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:37.280]   Uh 52 million iPhones for the quarter that would be a 1% increase
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.920]   Anything above that is gravy
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:47.280]   Last quarter 78.3 million devices, but that was the new phone right that was the iphone seven we're now in the second
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.760]   Quarter of the iphone seven
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:55.680]   Uh apple said early it expects to report between 51 and a half and 53 and a half billion in revenue
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:59.760]   analyst consensus 53 billion
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:06.480]   Apple always beats the analysts. I don't know why I don't know how I think they what they do is they sandbag
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:11.280]   Yeah, they put it just a little low enough that analysts are tempted to go just a little bit higher than they be both of them
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:17.600]   Haha. Got you again. It's like like hardly. It's just like lucy in the football social engineering. Uh, uh
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:24.880]   Services is something we'll all watch with interest. That's been a big and growing business. We're talking app store. I tunes
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:30.880]   Uh, I cloud it grew 18 remember what is it last year that your was
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:34.320]   Last quarter of the quarter before they said it might go to be one third of the business
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:39.760]   Wow in the next few years grew 18 percent last in the final quarter 2016 7.2 billion
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.480]   in revenue
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.840]   20 billion for the whole year. So yeah
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.640]   It's interesting because apple. I mean I
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:51.280]   Forgive me, but I I don't think apple's
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:57.680]   Known for it's just the it's the amazing historic strength. I think it's not a historic strength perfect phrase
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.760]   But the massive size of their business the number of iPhones out there
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:07.760]   Just powers that thing through and apple music is rising and it's just there's a lot of things in that ship now
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:14.960]   Jason snell at six colors says apples china sales are slipping in fact. They're now below european sales for the last three quarters
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:19.360]   Uh everybody had hoped big hopes for china opening up that market
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:25.200]   But it's been underperforming so we'll watch that with interest also subject to the whims of the leadership in china
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.160]   Yeah, it's a tough market to work in you don't you know
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.440]   Not just the leadership fads trends
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:36.960]   You know there are a number of very good chinese smartphone manufacturers like shalmi and
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.920]   While we keep scrolling there, which is good for not just apple but all these smartphone companies, right
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.440]   Uh, i'll be watching max sales because you know I still have
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:53.360]   I have less in my heart for a mac. I brought in today our old cheese grater because we're gonna benchmark that new
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.920]   Uh video card video card
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:01.760]   Uh, and we what we're gonna benchmark it in a pc and I don't know what variety of different things
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.120]   But uh, but of course I couldn't use the new mac pro the new
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:09.600]   We couldn't get it to work in my nihala mac pro because it needed a six eight and we only have six six power in there
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:13.600]   And we're kind of nervous to switch the power supply. I have the latest this is the most
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.280]   Cheese grater some hoping crossing our fingers. We we did get an external
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.160]   Thunderbolt box
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:28.960]   Now admittedly the the trash cam max is only thunderbolt too. So it's not going to be I doubt it will be a good choice for that
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.160]   But
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:33.600]   The new mac books are thunderbolt three so we'll try it with that as well
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:39.920]   So we're gonna that'll be for the new screen. I just bought a mac mini so we could mess around with a os 10 server and it came pre-installed with
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:44.080]   With el capitan so I don't think those things are moving too fast either. Okay
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:48.640]   Well, we'll watch with really came pre-installed with el capitan. Yeah, which makes me
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.280]   For a little while what the what?
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.520]   Yep
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:59.040]   When apple says that 98 percent of their sales are I think about suppose that but we people suspect that 98 percent of sales are mac books
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.040]   I think they're not far off. Wow
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.720]   Wow
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.720]   Uh, of course, you know that
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.600]   I
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:09.120]   It may be that in june on june fifth they'll announce something for wwc
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:13.120]   Yeah, they they didn't they never had an event, you know, I mean that was it they hit you know
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:19.200]   uh in the spring um we'll watch with uh mac uh at mace als they uh
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:24.000]   Max sales are slid for a year, but they grew slightly last quarter
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.840]   Remember they were kind of surprisingly up with 5.4 million units
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:34.560]   gardeny max though subtlety tough. Yeah gartner expects 4.2 million in this quarter which is the first
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:39.360]   The calendar quarter of 2017, but is apple's third quarter, right?
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.200]   I can't ever
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.720]   their second quarter
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:48.000]   I have a fiscal years off by something. Yeah, it's off by a quarter by a quarter. So it'll be the second quarter
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.080]   Uh ipad sales, you know, they've been down down down second quarter
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:58.720]   Second quarter. Okay. Uh, it's too early right for the three to twenty nine dollar ipad to make a difference
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.840]   Um, I think it probably was introduced right at the end of that quarter
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:05.760]   But that one's not going to be a high margin ipad like it's not going to be terrible because of the specs in it
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.720]   There's not going to be a huge high margin ipad the way that the ipad roll in
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:12.880]   Well units sales would still be interesting, but they don't break out uh units for ipads, right?
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.720]   It's just ipads not by model. They'll tell you overall but not they won't break like for none of their products
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.040]   Do they break out like how many iphone se's versus seven right?
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.560]   Right
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.600]   um
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.120]   apple watch
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:28.560]   Fast company says they're expecting five million units, but apple doesn't break out those numbers
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.200]   So we will have no way of knowing anyway
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.720]   Watch with interest follow i'more.com
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.360]   Renee will be writing it up
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.560]   Serenity you'll be doing her famous transcription
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.000]   Yep
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.280]   She's aces at those kind of bad news for the apple
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:52.400]   Watch or maybe not says rene richy. I have a theory. Oh, you tell them these and i'll tell you my theory apple
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:58.160]   Apps for the apple watch from google maps amazon and ebay
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.600]   are gone
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.400]   Uh, these updates that just came out in the app store no support for the apple watch why
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.840]   So uh, there's two prevailing theories mine was that when they shipped the iMessage extension
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.600]   They just did bad code and lost the apple watch extension in the mix
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.240]   Because i i don't have high hopes in their accounting skills
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.040]   I think the better answer is that they're rethinking the experience and we'll see something at wwdc with the brand new google
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.520]   Okay extension for watch os4. Okay
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.560]   It is the other ones i think just nobody used
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:34.240]   I think that's the real case is that the apple watch has turned out to be a fitness
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:40.480]   Device google maps was imposive for the other ones i absolutely believe that i think there's a very narrow case where apps are actually i think apple
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   Is gonna buy stuff on amazon
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:49.200]   Totally, but i think apple was mistaken the mistake was trying to make it an apps platform the way the iphone was instead of a true extension platform
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.640]   But maps extensions are hugely i use apple maps my watch all the time
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.920]   It is incredibly beneficial to have that stuff just telling you on your wrist where you're going
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.560]   So i can see google maps returning the other ones i think there's different use cases and is coincidental that those three
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.680]   Apparently google did give a statement to cnet saying that they expect to support it again in the future
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.200]   So google maps maps makes a lot of sense you still have apple maps on the watch
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.320]   But maps it's great sense. Yeah, but i could see a bay in amazon who's gonna buy something on a watch
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.280]   The only people who are upset were the ones who use it to keep updated on their auctions because they're really nice
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.280]   Let's have a nice thing that is a yeah, absolutely
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:29.520]   Andy i was just gonna say i wouldn't be surprised if google just said we're not we're not in a huge rush to get this fixed
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.400]   Uh, they certainly want to be committed on getting it on that platform
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.160]   But i think they acknowledge that particularly on a watch the built-in feature
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.320]   That uh video teaches them how to how to use it it's already on the on the phone
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:46.080]   Is going to have a leg up so i don't i would like to see the usage numbers between apple maps on the watch and google maps
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.320]   On the watch i would not be surprised if apple max is just smoking
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:56.240]   Uh spoken google maps on that platform. So it's not like there if they were if they were a tech problem that like oh my god
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:01.200]   We're we're we're orphaning 80 80 hundred million users right now. They'd be more like, okay
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.480]   Well, let's fix this but we don't have to it's not on all hands on deck sort of thing
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:10.400]   They made the iMessage app, you know, it's like not so you can you can sort of share your directions on the iMessage
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:14.240]   Yeah, which i guess is useful, but you don't still extra effort. That's a force touch i think right
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.080]   Well, it's on and then you message is out on the iphone. Yeah, you can you sort of share directions right from messages. Oh, okay
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.680]   Yeah, there's a if you force touch apple maps you can share your location
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.680]   Uh
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.000]   If you bought a first generation apple watch good news
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.880]   Uh, the repair period has been extended to three years one more year
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:41.840]   Yeah, this is apparently some people are having battery issues swollen or expanded batteries. Look at that watch. It's got a screen is pop it open
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.960]   a baba lui saide
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.480]   Adai saide. It's like a pop-up timer saying that okay, you're done
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.760]   Battery's big
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.760]   But I mean anytime you have a battery issue most companies are going to be incredibly attentive of those because yes
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:03.600]   Lithium ion is not a safe technology and until we get what this solid state is what they're promising next we'll get the solid state batteries
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.000]   Yes, that's keep my on though
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.680]   All right, let's take a break
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.680]   Annie and ico rene ritchie. We're going to get you out of here in half an hour rene. You got to be ready

[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.520]   Best solution if you love magazines is Netflix for magazines. That's what I call it. It's not Netflix

[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:50.240]   Sponus features like videos that you can't get on a paper
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:55.120]   And I have to say if you like photography, they've got a bunch of photography magazines, of course national geographic
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.720]   The pictures look spectacular on your iPad
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.680]   Much better than they do when they're screened and printed on paper. So this is actually a better
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.840]   Place to read magazines and I have to say it's better for the environment and it's better for your wallet, too
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.360]   You know, I hate I love the New Yorker
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:16.480]   But I always feel guilty because there's a pile of them that I say I'm gonna get to that there's
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:21.520]   There there are magazines like Rolling Stone where there's one article I want to read once a month
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:26.000]   But I don't want to subscribe and it's really expensive to buy one issue of it on the new stand
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.640]   This is perfect texture makes it easy to find the articles you want to read even in magazines

[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:44.960]   Billboard's expensive. I'm not gonna subscribe to it, but it's fun. No what the hits are I used to read it when I was in radio
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:49.680]   The stations would always get it. There's it's just great. I love it. US politics

[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.640]   Do not open attachments
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.120]   Actually, I want to pick a
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:55.280]   Little knit with you rene richy you wrote this
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:01.680]   Uh, actually lori gill wrote this for i'm more psa another reason not to open attachments for strangers
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.320]   And I and I think it's a really important article to read but I should point out
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.280]   that
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.560]   Fishing scams ransomware usually doesn't come from a stranger
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:17.120]   It comes from your boss. Oh, holy true or the irs or
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:23.920]   Maybe your best buddy so frankly open attachments don't open attachments, especially from people you know
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.280]   Our ad blockers are really getting away here. I'm sorry
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.840]   I mean every one of those clicks is costing me income Leo
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:37.280]   I'm just I only do it. I do it for the show because you know, I don't know totally
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:42.240]   Clutter on the page, but I got a turn now it says escalation now everyone's blocking ads
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.600]   So the ad companies are figuring out ways of telling that you're blocking ads. I can't yeah
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.760]   I can't now I can no longer get in there's a little button at the bottom that says screw you
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.280]   Oh, I don't want to use ads anyway
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.400]   Well, I don't mind. I really don't mind in fact. I actually appreciate it when sites remind me
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.280]   Oh, just you know turn off you block origin for this page because this is how I mean I read
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.920]   I'm more religiously so let me just turn it off and refresh and there it is all as well again
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.440]   um
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.240]   So this is doc dok. So named because the attachment is document.zip spelled with a k
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:19.120]   Checkpoint technologies found this yes mac ransomware
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.320]   I guess or maybe not ransomware mac malware it could be ransomware
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.360]   Because what happens is uh, you know, it says hey quick open up this file
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:32.560]   You might be fooled because it's document.zip
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:39.840]   what's a little scary of it is that gatekeeper doesn't block it because there's a
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.520]   uh
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.680]   signed certificate on it
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.280]   But it that was legit now it's been revoked of course apple immediately revoked it so it won't work anymore
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.840]   How does somebody get are they forging certificates or stealing them there's a right away sometimes
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.560]   They just register company get a bunch of certificates and then start abusing them
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:01.600]   Sometimes they take ownership of a certificate that was issued to somebody else. I mean, it's it's not impossible to get those
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.720]   Happened before right with a Turkish developer. I think yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.440]   So you the good news is uh, you're not gonna likely get bit by this now
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.840]   Uh, but that's the problem with viruses
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:17.920]   They spread so fast because of email that they often spread before apple has a chance to revoke the certificate
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.680]   Uh, so doc if you had opened it would have owned your system
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:27.360]   Uh first according to checkpoint major scale malware to target os 10
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.320]   users
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:33.200]   So as of may 1st though, you'll get a warning
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.640]   Um, I think steve gipson has spoken before but it's it's often their economical attacks when it becomes
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.480]   Uh, financially viable to attack max they attack max if it costs money and nobody ever clicks and then they don't right
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.080]   But if suddenly it's not that expensive and people start clicking on it makes all sense that we're all from the do it
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:53.200]   And just a reminder don't open attachments just because you're on a mac doesn't mean you're invulnerable
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.760]   You're safer. I would absolutely say gatekeeper works really well. It's a great system
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:03.840]   Uh, but uh, don't i'm even reticent. I shouldn't be but i'm even reticent open attachments on ios even though it's you know, it's completely
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.320]   Environment, but you just never I would never want to be patient zero same thing for links
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.960]   If I get links, uh, you know, I'm very cautious about clicking those
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.840]   You just don't know
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.720]   And you don't want to be the first yeah, you don't want to be patient zero the first one to get bit
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:27.200]   No, and it was it was funny because back in my old life, um in the enterprise we would have suddenly the network would be infested with
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:33.200]   uh people dumping um files onto everywhere and what happened and someone in the meekly in the corner went
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.520]   But it said picks on the link and I clicked it
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.120]   You know, just all it takes is one right right
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:44.240]   Apple may introduce uh, so apple has apple pay
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:51.680]   But it doesn't have anything like venmo, which is a paypal feature that allows you to send here to peer peer to peer
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.080]   Uh messenger I can send payments
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.080]   Uh apple apparently considering launching its own version of venmo
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.200]   Uh peer to peer payments with apple pay. I tell you more and more. I'm telling people
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:09.120]   I'm really sold now on how much safer apple pay is than credit cards credit card
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.520]   Fraud is through the roof through the roof
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.600]   Uh both lee said and i've had our credit card stolen in the last few months
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.000]   It just has kind of chip now and we've had that for years and I remember going to the mall saying
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.560]   Oh, and they would tell you always put in your pin code wrong the first time because if the software is legit
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.120]   It'll reject it, but if it's if it's a skimmer
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.800]   It won't know that it's a fake number
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.280]   I'll just try to record it and like I just start worrying about that now or just dropping my tap to pay card
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.440]   At the gas station and paying for the gas for the next five people behind me before I realize it
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:44.080]   And so when you have apple pay and it's authenticated and it's with you and it's part of your device or it's on your wrist
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.760]   I am totally stress free in all of my interactions now
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.560]   It would be awesome if apple would have a peer to pay to pay appear to peer pay payment solution as well
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:57.120]   Exxon mobile we showed this yesterday on iOS today. You can now pay at the pump
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.920]   But you know it's not apple pay
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:03.600]   Yeah, it's sort of but also our code saying and it makes me nervous
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.000]   It's such a it's such a beautiful
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.920]   It really is something apple I think would really really latch on to because
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.400]   Your friends usually have like iPhones or apple watches now
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.880]   Imagine where it's at the end of the you've had you just had a really great dinner
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:25.040]   And now you kind of split the bill someone wants the airline points and all you got to do you take I take up my phones
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.040]   Okay, how much is the bill great? Here's
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.680]   $36 and 27 cents. I touched my I touched my finger on my pad
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:37.760]   My my my friend gets a bleep. He touches his finger on his pad and he's got 36 dollars and 22 cents
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:43.600]   That could be like the most that could be that could be like the most social way of handing cash over
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.360]   Ever I think that I think they'd love to do that. I think they'd love to demo that on stage. Yes, exactly
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.320]   Speaking of which what are we expecting?
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.640]   We're coming up. We're one month out from a ww dc. Are you just did it Leo?
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:03.200]   It's craig is gonna get money from that eddy owes him from the karaoke live on stage eddy lost the bed at karaoke
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.200]   I would be surprised to see that
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:10.880]   He owes me eddy. You owe me 20 bucks or or someone owes 20 bucks to tim on the last war eagles game, you know
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.640]   Yep, june 5th through 9th. You're coming down rene. Yes, sir
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.760]   Andy do you know if you're gonna go to ww dc you're gonna stay
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:23.360]   I might it looks like i'm staying home, but I might have some work to do in there that might I can move up and
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:30.000]   Could get down there. All right. I'll I'll be here and we'll stream the keynote, uh, of course
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.680]   Um, and I you know, I think it'll be very interesting to see this is now apples really
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:39.040]   Aside from any product announcements. They do their big event
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.840]   And we didn't get a spring event
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:47.120]   Do you think they'll announce? I mean, it's not typically when you would announce consumer products in the past
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.120]   They've announced you know
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.760]   Backbook pros and mac pros. Yeah, you know with the kind of thing i developer'd be interested
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.720]   But we've already got the new their pros. I don't macbook pros. I don't know
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.920]   Well, also it's time it could be an opportunity for them to double down on their look. We are serious
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.000]   We really aren't abandoning the mac look what we're doing to enhance mac hardware
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.720]   So this could be an opportunity for them to show off some new a preview of new hardware
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:15.120]   Just as they did with the with the the uh, quick erodes box mac pro
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:22.800]   Uh without actually shipping it but also do it in front of a room of people who are going to scream and applaud and p target audiences for a professional
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.480]   Actually, that's a really good point. Uh, you know, I can see them coming
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.560]   You know, kraig federigi saying, you know, you may remember that a couple of months ago. We briefed
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.280]   Uh a number of you on
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:37.920]   Our plans for the mac pro. We said we'll have it by next year. We just want to let you know
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.880]   We're we're making progress. Here's what we're thinking so far. It's very early in the in it
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.400]   But uh, I would be strongly encouraged by something like that
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.280]   I hope they do something like that
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.000]   I'd also I'd also like to see them sort of tip their hand towards an x generation macOS
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   Um, it's uh, it's I still love macOS. I just i'm still waiting for that thing that says that
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.720]   We are not just simply winding it down
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:09.040]   We are actually excited about it and we're going to make it do more things than it could this year
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.800]   And not little improvements like we're taking ios stuff and putting it on the mac
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:18.960]   I really am looking forward to them saying we are here's how here's how committed we are. We are actually going to be introducing
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.960]   Uh, uh mac macOS montreal or kebec
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:28.160]   Right, uh, because we're gonna take it. We're taking it to a blend of freedom and liberty where we can actually do whatever we want
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.200]   Uh
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:37.120]   I would like to see them talk about the new apple file system
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.240]   They've they should they kind of just snuck it in the ios
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.800]   In the last update, uh, is a session on last year
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.440]   I'm sure they'll have many sessions, but I would love to see them say oh by the way apfs
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:54.080]   Comes and gout next week on, uh macOS or something like that
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.880]   It's more than you know, it was one thing to install it on an iphone or an i an ipad
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.640]   It's a big deal to put it on a desktop. So maybe I think they'll be a little bit more
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.600]   It'll be like well, you'll have the option to install it with this version and you'll be able to back out of it
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.960]   And that's going to be a real gentle, uh, sort of transition
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.800]   I'm interested to see if they talk about this because there's all of a sudden all these rumors about the home hub
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:19.120]   And if you're going to talk about syri kit and home kit and you're going to have a device that
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.240]   Specializes in those things that would be a good time to sort of either hint heavily that it's coming in the fall
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:27.760]   Or even preview it for people and develop it right right on
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.320]   It's I like how apple is very cohesive and uh, they they got one stair
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.480]   They got one steering wheel in the drive in the car in one direction
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:39.440]   But sometimes I really wish that it were more like five divisions and the home kit division
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.360]   Guess to be the angry people jumping up and down on other people's desk saying
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.640]   God damn you're gonna give me give me 20 damn minutes in the keynote
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.320]   I'm going to show off this great stuff dammit because otherwise you get the idea
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.520]   Hey, remember how once you were really really hot about home kit and now
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:58.320]   I can't even remember if it's supposed to be all one word with a uppercase k or not
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:05.680]   Maybe you should show me how awesome home kit still is with some actual products and devices that are improving people's lives in colorful ways
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.040]   All right rumor time
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.520]   I hate doing these
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:15.040]   Oh, come on hit us. Leo hit us with the rumor. I I I
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.600]   Uh, if I don't do it somebody will say hey, what about the fact that the
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.280]   Somebody's real news and you didn't talk about microsoft. Not the
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.760]   Saying the iphone 8 won't ship until 2018
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.200]   We're here man. Uh
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:35.920]   What do you think won't ship today? I can tell you that exactly
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:42.560]   New york with air pods it's hard to say because like even with apple has the best of intentions
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:45.600]   Even when they want to ship things at a certain date it doesn't always work out for them
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:50.880]   So it's it's sort of like kind of play prescience at this point. Yeah, and they they haven't announced anything
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.360]   Of ship dates. Yeah, how could you say it's late?
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.080]   If it's uh not announced
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.960]   Will it be called the iphone edition?
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.720]   They can literally go to a machine and type in a few keys and everything from the packaging to the website
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.640]   A product manager does that and I think michael gartenberg has spoken about this
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.520]   They start off with a name then they go through a list of a thousand alternatives
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.320]   Then often they go back to the original name, but sometimes not always
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.920]   Uh, so at the end of the day, they'll pick the name that I think macbook
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.000]   The macbook nothing was originally macbook stealth and then they end up just settling on macbook. Yeah, so it's it's interesting processes
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.960]   I feel dirty. I should I hey bringing these things up
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.040]   Uh, it's a service
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.400]   I mean we had a conversation with dowrylle once where he said I feel like I have to tell people because otherwise
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:38.080]   They're just gonna believe all the rumors that they read. Yeah, so we're able to kind of uh cast some cold water
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:44.640]   Or just some yeah give some context. How about this one? Uh, uh, uh a standalone series
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.880]   Kind of like a amazon echo
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.600]   That I believe right everybody wants to do it
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:56.160]   My question is like what is it how is it different than apple tv because if it's just if it's it could be the new apple tv
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.960]   But if it's not the new apple tv is it exactly the same as apple tv without the apple tv on it
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:04.320]   Is it actually a speaker that has apple tv like phone?
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.040]   I just want I want to know what it is as a product because I think saying that it's an Alexa or a google home hub
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.920]   It's just not typically the way apple could be but it's apple typically try to solve a problem with that would be
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.920]   Untotally new product wouldn't end that yeah, my hope is it'll be multi part
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.960]   One of the things that hasn't been solved yet is multi personal assistance
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.880]   We're all great with show me my messages
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:25.040]   But if you and lee sir at home and you say show me my messages
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.120]   It has to know that you're leo and you want your messages and not start giving you lee's messages
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.840]   And we're not quite at the cusp yet where ai and voice recognition is good enough to do that
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.000]   But if we could leap forward so that everybody in the house can go there and say give me my messages
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.480]   Tell me my add this to my calendar and it just happens because it knows enough about you to guess
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.680]   Whether it's facial recognition or voice recognition and it can do all that stuff at a deeply personal level
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.120]   I think I think that's why apple didn't do that on apple tv as they weren't there yet
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.240]   But I think there's a real opportunity to make a multi personal assistant there
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.160]   Yeah, they've google home has started to do that typical for google
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.240]   It's like it doesn't work great, but they promise it'll get better as it goes along
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:08.320]   Uh, I I like the idea of them doing something serie like because oh boy
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.080]   It really is the intersection of so many blobs on the apple
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.320]   Apple fascination venn diagram the some things they they really love
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:21.200]   Uh, they really they really like media and music if they make it a really good speaker without
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.600]   necessarily making it a thousand dollar speaker
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.480]   They'll really gonna get behind that because it makes itunes sound even better makes it even more important if they've
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:34.560]   It's a high it could be a high high end item of which a household might want to buy several copies of
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.640]   Because that was my that was my experience with echo. I got one for review
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.160]   And I was like, okay, dang it. I got when I send this back. I'm gonna have to buy one
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:47.280]   And now there are three different echo devices in my house because I just bought it always to be with an earshot
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.680]   Even if it's just to tell me what the temperature is
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.560]   Uh, also it what helps solve the home kit problem
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:58.960]   Because if we make it into this is the one this is the always on device that will be served as a home kit hub
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:05.760]   Uh, it has it's people don't necessarily I've always thought that boy wouldn't be given that the apple tv is always powered on
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.480]   Wouldn't that be great if that could be the home kit
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.200]   Sentinel for the entire house all the time, but people will associate
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.080]   Hey schlomo turn on the lights in the kitchen right now
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.520]   They don't with a with a with that kind of a speakable device. They might not necessarily consider that
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.000]   A function of a tv device and lastly it allows them to make syri
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:32.240]   More valuable because this is now something that it's not just on your phone. It's not just a feature that you probably don't use on your mac
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:36.480]   It's now something that is everywhere just you know, just just like Jarvis
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.760]   It's like you just ask for Jarvis to do something and Jarvis will do this for you
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:44.640]   So I really think that and I'm sorry. I even I forgot even lastly
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:50.160]   Just as a beautiful object that will be out in somebody's living room
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.200]   That's another thing they will love to do
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.720]   So this is this idea
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.840]   I don't I don't know anything about whether they're actually planning this or not
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.960]   But this is a rumor that really gets me excited
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:06.400]   To see if they were to do this what they would do because this again going back to the airport
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.560]   This could be just the one the perfectly designed apple thing
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.760]   So it really plays all their strengths sunny dixon says he thinks it's gonna be like a mac pro
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.640]   Which should be pretty funny
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.680]   Unsold cases than people buying so
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:26.240]   A mini you know what that would be gorgeous. I think you're right though. Both of you're right
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.320]   It needs to be something different than echo
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.800]   Uh or google home that they're late to the market people have already decided
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.040]   Mostly on echo
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.040]   Uh, I don't know their late series west market
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.360]   There's a lot of countries that have a theory that don't have
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.320]   I'm a they just can't use the camera. I am that useful or good
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:46.240]   But on the other hand if they tied it to I think you're right if they tied it to apple music or beats
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:50.320]   And it's got it's always plugged in it's got seven beamforming mics the way an echo does
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:56.240]   Great speakers and I love the face recognition because that is actually a problem with both echo and google home
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.080]   Echo lets you switch accounts at least but it doesn't know who you are
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:05.440]   Could it's your voice it should recognize your voice at least and it's also apple is incredibly cautious with this stuff
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.480]   So for example, you can't use home kits secure on an apple tv because it has no fingerprint
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:15.040]   You can only do that and that means like door locks and things so you can't open your doors using apple tv
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.840]   Because they don't want an open window and someone to go buy and yell
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.360]   A schlomo open the door and suddenly they're bursting into your house
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:24.720]   So they they demand a fingerprint or a passcode for those sorts of things
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:29.520]   So it had you have to have a reasonable amount of authentic of authentication in order for it to do the more secure features
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.080]   And it'll be interesting to see how they do that with a stand alone speak
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:35.440]   Well, they could do what the amazon's doing put a camera on the darn thing
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.400]   That doesn't seem like an apple thing to do
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:44.560]   It seems like a google thing google's google's google's ideal product is at the intersection between oh my god
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:49.440]   This is the most amazing wonderful thing like oh my god. That's the creepiest thing i've ever done with my life
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:54.080]   This is the we're talking about the amazon look which is an echo
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:24:00.880]   But with a camera and lights and the idea is it's supposed to take pictures of your fashion choices and rank them
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.960]   You think you're gonna call an amazon's keep and they got talked off of that one keep with the good
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.680]   Again, that's that's for sheen learning amazon's ai has been spending so much time observing
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.200]   Human behavior that even it cannot it can even now body shame you
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:17.840]   We're not gonna call this one. We're not gonna call this one lx. So we're gonna call it tom
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.840]   And
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:26.160]   That in this in this shortly. Oh, no, no, it'll it'll it'll it'll be it's even more sophisticated that it'll say i admire you
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.400]   So much to have so much like that and not even care
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:35.280]   Yes, that is the perfect you're this for your inspiration
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:41.200]   They uh, they also in another rumor amazon said we're gonna start making
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.520]   Tailored clothing
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:48.320]   So that would tie in very nicely with this if this look could kind of it could say okay
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.240]   Already knows your inseam Leo knows what you like it knows your inseam
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.280]   It knows whether you dress to the left or the right and it can make
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:59.280]   Maybe that's a little too much information
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:06.240]   Exactly. I was out there's no hiding from amazon. I see your dressing dressing left today. Oh, yeah, like your butla
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:10.160]   I it is chilly there today
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.440]   Shrink it
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:23.280]   Are you sure you don't want you don't need to pee? I woke you up because usually you pee at this. Oh my god
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.160]   Concat home kit for japanese bidet is
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:32.560]   I was I was talking I was talking to your mom's device and we're both really concerned that you're not eating enough
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.560]   You seem a little bit pale. Oh
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.320]   At leo
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.120]   Gs than your voice by the way
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:49.120]   Uh, mink she quotes says 50 50 chance that they will announce some sort of serie device at ww
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.080]   dc
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:56.400]   Don't you love the six to five and pick them headlines? Yeah, only whether people don't get fired if I if I have 50 50 odds at my job
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.280]   I'd lose it and then I'm looking at a this is the story from the uk
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.880]   Newspaper the mirror and I think it's hysterical because in the middle of the story
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:07.200]   They link to a story from cnet
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.440]   With the same rumor amazon's echo could see with the built-in camera
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:18.160]   Uh, apple's echo rival could see you with built-in camera and it's from may 27th 2016
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.720]   So clearly these rumors have been
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.840]   floating around for a little while
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.480]   More than i'm gonna have a grill. I want to speak or why would a speaker have grills? This is all confusing
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.520]   Yeah, I don't I don't mean to hijack this show for my own purposes
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:37.360]   But rinne could I want to pitch you like an imore column where I just make up rumors on a by every other week
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.640]   That's actually a great idea and easy it's easy for me
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.600]   I I think i'm smart enough that I could make a makeup lens that would make some kind of sense if you do it
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:52.160]   And I will take the john most lawsuit. I will take the john most lawsuit for that. I like it. Are you in Canada? You can't be sued
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:54.720]   There you go
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:00.160]   You can't across the border now. Yeah, oh did they really he did crazy apple rumors?
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.120]   Yeah, didn't you do crazy apple rumors for a long time? I love it. I'm remiss remembering. No, I I'm sure he did
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.120]   It's a great idea
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.400]   Anything else we want to talk about before we take a break and get to your picks
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:16.640]   We need to get rinne off and running. We need to get him typing and stretching. I see I see him doing this
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:22.080]   In the chair like darth mall, you know, you're waiting for the the four shield to go down on the earnings
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:27.200]   He's like he's like those at the the sprinters the olympics before like a tempest before they start they're all like
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.520]   Before they I don't hate bow up. But I'll pity any fool
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.600]   Was it greg lugeinis? Who was it that was doing the the stare at the olympics
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.240]   Is summer was it was the new guy?
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:46.480]   I can't remember trying to intimidate the water. I dare you to splash your refills. Yeah, yeah, rinne
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.520]   You got to get your mike. Oh, uh, felps face on
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:56.800]   Let me see if I have enough time to smoke that much pot though. He was he was really I've he was preparing for the olympics
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.280]   He was he was
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.800]   My favorite though that one. I'll go with hicks and gracy. Yeah
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.040]   I'm gonna be
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.720]   Get your car
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.960]   This is the stuff you can get away with when you have we need one 15 gold medals in the same week
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:21.120]   Is the apple rumors.com curated by john malts john malts is it known who john malts is what john malts is uh pseudonym was
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:27.680]   I think it's only known that he hosts really bad podcast with like statement. I shall not I sh my lips are sealed
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.640]   I won't say who he was
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.120]   um
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:40.240]   Okay, let's son of poor Oklahoma sharecroppers. That's who he is. That's the apple rumors about sight. I love john. He is fact

[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:27.920]   upside dot com a brand new sponsor we welcome them to to the show and they have a
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.880]   It's like they have an app on the app store they do
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:37.840]   So you can also use their iphone app if you wish
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:40.800]   upside business travel
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:48.160]   All right, let's get to it picks of the week. Let's do rene first in case you need to run rene richie
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:53.360]   So I asked to confess I did order this I don't have it yet because I just saw that it was available
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.320]   And it is a new charging brick for the iphone
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:00.000]   I know everybody has five or six dozen of these and don't think they need another one
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.680]   But what got me with the battery pro from elevation lab is that it puts an apple watch charger right on there
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.080]   Now some of us travel with a whole bunch of apple
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:12.880]   Gear and that means numerous cores like you have your usb c cable you have your iphone cable
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:15.120]   You have your apple watch cable maybe your ipad cable
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:19.600]   So the ability to reduce the amount of cables that I have with me is just it's very compelling
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:26.000]   So this is a normal iphone battery charger, but it has the inductive the magnetic
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.560]   inductive charging
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:33.520]   Disc right on top of the battery pack so you can plug in your iphone and just sort of lay your
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:37.280]   Apple watch on top of it and in my dream world if it all works out
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.320]   I will just get to the hotel i'll plug in the battery pack plug in my iphone
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:45.120]   Stick the apple watch on top of it and not have to worry about two thirds of the cables that I usually
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:50.800]   Traveled with and it's got some really clever things like you can just wrap it around to sort of carry your apple watch on the go
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:55.680]   Although, I don't know how it's gonna get it off my wrist without killing me first because it's just always always on my wrist
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:01.280]   It's used to you just like those just like the gem in in logan's run telling you
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.440]   Totally
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:08.320]   I mean Tony start built it in a cave out of scraps and it hasn't left my chest cavity since then
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.000]   But it just is very clever and I like very clever solutions
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.880]   And if my apple watch on occasion has run out of battery because I didn't put it properly on the adductive plate
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:19.680]   Or I somehow knocked it off and it can go a day and a half
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:22.240]   But I get to the afternoon and realize it didn't charge overnight
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:26.880]   And suddenly it's dead on my wrist and I want to wait a quickly charge it because if it's dead
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:30.560]   I can't close those rings and apple is incredibly unforgiving about those rings
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:34.480]   It's like they never heard of rest days or or two overs or anything like that
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.720]   That's you man. Nobody's putting that pressure on you, but you but I want the perfect week
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:44.160]   And if the watch is charged, I'm ready and it's not and you know that sort of I feel like that's their fault not mine perfect
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:50.000]   Means perfect. You have to be perfect in every way more than perfect. Yeah, so much pressure
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.560]   But this looks like this looks like a really clever
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:56.720]   Solution and people out there have been looking for something this I know I'm gonna give it a try as soon as it arrives
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.240]   And if anyone else is interested, it's just I like it nice
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.160]   Nice battery pro. It's from elevation lab
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:10.720]   Hondo it'll cost you a hundred. It's a hundo cost you a hundred to find out
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:14.480]   I mean you could just get a regular battery pack and use the
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:18.400]   Apple watch cake. I have a giant one right now the giant mophie
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:22.160]   Dual station something rather with two plugs in it
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.760]   They can both power an iPad and I stick a watch and one and iPad or an iPhone and the other
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.840]   But it's still a lot of cabling and this right?
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:33.280]   There's no great solution for that for any for any watch that group that goes that way. I like the
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:37.760]   The elastic band that holds the watch in place. I think that's kind of clever
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:41.040]   It's just yeah, it's like clever like the loss of raptors and drastic part clever
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.800]   Just thank you. You know, I bet that if you got a hot glue gun you could actually like attach a strap to that battery
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:53.040]   Keep it keep the watch on the battery and therefore not have to take off your apple watch for like 11 days
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.960]   You joke, but I was that idiot who had the disc underneath his watch while wearing it with the core going through the sleeve
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.960]   No
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.680]   Came out and I was trying to review it and I was walking you're trying to get everything done before I
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:11.840]   Yeah, it was I well. I mean some people like like tall watches big watches. I'm not gonna judge towards an egg
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840]   You're not gonna judge. No judging
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.400]   Annie and I co pick of the week, sir
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:19.120]   Uh one quick hit on the apple air pods
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.680]   I would happen to be in the apple store a couple weeks ago
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.560]   They had them so I bought them thinking that okay if I don't like them all return to me
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:29.520]   The well review them. I really like them even though I am my primary phone is indeed an android phone
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:33.600]   Everything that rene has said is absolutely true. I mean they they don't fall out
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:38.880]   They they're a little in danger of falling out when I'm running a bike because my bike helmet has those straps
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.240]   But otherwise they they stay firm. They will last all day long
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:48.320]   The because of the battery that's built in here on an iOS device. They really attach connect really really quickly
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:52.640]   I love just as a physical object this thing. It's just a wonderful case
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:55.280]   And I was very very pleased to find that
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.640]   Even on my android phone it actually works better than most of the bluetooth phone headphones that i've tried
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.840]   Because despite the fact there's no wire connecting the two
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:10.960]   They really stay connected to the phone. That's that's about two feet away in my pocket more consistently than my
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:13.440]   My previous bluetooth headphones
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.200]   They're not everything about them is the greatest thing
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.440]   But they're really really nice and I am going to keep them because they really I really like the way they work
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.640]   I concur I use it with android as well. It is my now my prof
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.760]   I use it with the iphone mostly, but it's my preferred way to make phone calls
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:30.800]   It's it's easily the best way to do it. And by the way new research shows airpods
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:34.080]   Have a 98 customer satisfaction
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:37.520]   And the recommendation rate was incredible too. Yeah, yeah
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:41.680]   This is research from creative strategies and experience
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:48.240]   They surveyed a thousand people 98 satisfied 82 say very satisfied
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:53.600]   There are 2% say neither satisfied nor is this satisfied or dissatisfied
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.040]   So very low very low dissatisfaction rate. That's good
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:01.840]   And there are a lot of people who complain that my god these they they look kind of stupid like sticking out of yours
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:07.600]   But I don't I don't agree. I mean you can barely see it in mine. It helps if you have
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:14.880]   I don't you know what I just wear them and I don't care what people think it doesn't the courts don't look fantastic either
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.240]   I mean, right?
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:18.480]   Long dangling white cords. They're really convenient
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:22.400]   So that so let me saw I can endorse even for people who don't
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:25.040]   Who have let's say a 70 apple
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.200]   Hardware instead of 100 percent
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.320]   But the other thing I would really want to recommend was a really cool presentation app that I just discovered a week ago
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:36.800]   Called deck set. It is a presentation app that's built on markdown
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:40.160]   So really you just have a text file that is
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:46.160]   Marked up with markdown using the regular markdown tags. We are just putting number sign for
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.720]   Next to something that's going to be a header
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:49.840]   Three
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.720]   Three pound signs is here's the next slide. There's some a little bit a few custom markdown things to say hey
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:58.160]   I want a font change here. I want you to insert this this graphic here
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.360]   And it just it means that any app even like a little notepad app you've got on whatever
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:08.080]   Free $50 phone you bought at the drugstore you can now edit your presentations with
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:13.360]   It's not the only it's not a replacement for PowerPoint or for keynote because
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:19.520]   The only thing that I miss about it is about keynote with this is that it's not it's not easy to say oh man
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:23.440]   I don't turns out that those four slides. I don't need or I really wish that this section
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:29.040]   We're up here because now you're in the text editor doing cut and paste looking for the tags that represent slides
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:34.640]   But it's ideal for those kind of presentations you that a lot of people have to give where every Tuesday morning
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.240]   There you have to give a 10 minute presentation as part of the weekly on hand
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:42.240]   About here is what the funding goal is and here's what the status of this server is
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:47.360]   Where really all you have to do is change numbers in a table every single week or change like a
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:52.560]   Announcements there you just basically on the way on the way from you know
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:58.480]   The from from from the vending machines where you got your coffee and your donut and in the two-minute walk to the conference room
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.720]   You can just be in a text editor and
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:06.240]   Be changing those numbers or maybe even write a simple script that builds that markdown file for you
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.640]   And the and the pre-done templates are actually very very nice. So it really is nice
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:15.360]   I look forward to I'm sure that one of the presentations I give the next three or four months is going to be the perfect thing for this
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:20.560]   It's 30 bucks. It's called a deck set and I think it's a very very polished app
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:26.080]   Now it's not the only app that is a markdown powered presentation app there's some that are actually free
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:34.000]   But I would have this one is nicely polished. It's nicely done. There's a free demo that just puts this annoying little post-it bug saying
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.400]   This guy didn't
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.480]   Don't don't fund this guy's startup. He didn't even afford
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:44.560]   $30 in this presentation app. It's a demo version, but it really I really like the attitude of it
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.600]   I really like how it works great stuff. You might mention to them. There's a little
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:52.240]   typo in their Haskell programming code though. They're doing a factorial function
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:57.360]   If there's a typo in the bottom here, I like it though that it does automatic code highlighting
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:02.800]   Syntax it does it has formatting for code has formatting for for like math CAD and text
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:07.520]   So if there seems to be it has has code for if you want to do a table if you want to have split
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.480]   You want to have four pictures striped on the screen
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.400]   It seems like there's very little that it can't do and if nothing else
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:18.960]   I often get more fascinated by the visual stuff where I'm so proud of myself
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.000]   I've had six hours to like finish and like fine-tune my presentation one night
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.320]   As someone got the idea would it be great if there were like a horizontal line on every slide
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:36.320]   And it moves up and down during transitions to highlight different and I've got too excited about doing that animated number that I probably that animated line
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:40.080]   I probably should have spent more time and actually we can we can cut 10 minutes from this
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:45.360]   So this will act really force you to just focus on what you want to say. I think that's gonna help be helpful for
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:49.520]   Dopes like me. Nice nicely done nicely done app very nice
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:55.200]   Uh, I have not tried it yet, but I did want to mention that it's available now
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.160]   You may remember that the jonathan zadarski our favorite
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.560]   Mac security guru who took a job at apple had to let little flocker
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:11.120]   Go and did sell it to the folks at f secure who made great stuff f secure bundled it into a
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:15.520]   Security package that they're offering now for free called xfence
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.240]   Uh, it might only be freed while it's in beta
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:23.920]   I don't know but it has little flocker and more they say an effective way to prevent silent exfiltration
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:26.560]   encryption or destruction of your
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:30.480]   Data that was the idea behind little flocker was keep an eye on
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.720]   Bad guys trying to change system files or encrypt your data things like that
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:44.400]   You so applications have to get permission before they use your webcam or start programs or take control of other programs or eavesdrop on your internet connection
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:50.320]   I little flocker was a little too aggressive and difficult for me. Yeah, so I turn it off
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:55.760]   But f secure has a great reputation. They're good good people and they're offering it for free
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.120]   For download or right now on your macintosh. So
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.760]   Check it out and I'll download it and try it and get back to you next week with the
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:11.680]   My impressions they say f secures xfence 166 is our initial beta release of xfence
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:16.720]   It's a current feature set is compatible with little flocker 164 first version of xfence
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.840]   We'll not be able to migrate your little flocker rules
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:22.800]   or preferences
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:28.320]   Nor will it be published as an update to existing little flocker users. So it sounds like it's probably time
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:32.720]   To move to xfence, although they do plan to have an automatic upgrade
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.280]   Uh, which will import your rules and preferences in the future if you're using little flocker
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:43.600]   Ladies and gentlemen time to let rene richie and anionaco go so they could pay attention
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:46.640]   And listen to the analyst call which is an hour out
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:52.800]   Well, uh next week we'll gather once again, uh and talk about what apple announced this week
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:58.400]   Just kind of what we do every week all the money all the monies how much money does apple have
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.000]   All of it
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.560]   None more monies since we didn't run out of time. I'll mention one more story that we didn't get to we talked about it yesterday
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.280]   on, um
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:14.160]   Uh, ios today maryam webster the dictionary company has added a new word
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.000]   To its dictionary called the word is sheeple
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:24.240]   And as you know when there's a new word they always give you sites citations to existing
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:28.240]   Uses of the word the example
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:31.280]   They're using in a sentence
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:38.000]   Apple debuted a battery case for the juice sucking iphone an ungainly lumpy case
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.320]   The sheeple
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:44.800]   Will happily shell out $99 for that seems a little bit editorial
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:49.680]   Is nothing it's nothing like having your ds e canada
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:56.880]   Uh, it's it's but they're they have to use a they tend to use citations from actual publications
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.280]   So I don't know the author of this is dug chris
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:04.640]   Do you any of you know who that is? Let me do a search for him. Ah, cnn
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.480]   Oh
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.680]   CNN
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:12.720]   So dug your name will live in infamy and infamy as the
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:18.720]   Whether whether it's a editorial or not my mom would have been thrilled if I were quoted in a dictionary
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:23.120]   So I would like I would give him any crap for that exactly that's true. That's true. That's true. Congratulations, sir
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.840]   So and you know, it's a good word sheeple
