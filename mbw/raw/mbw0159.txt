[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.360]   our good friend from thepicksocor.com.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.120]   Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.620]   Hello.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.600]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.120]   How's it going?
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.640]   It's very well.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.360]   How are you?
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.000]   Good.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.200]   I walked all the way.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.800]   You did?
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.120]   You probably have great legs.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.800]   I'm working on it.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.120]   You know, it's actually a pretty good exercise
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.320]   walking to and from the office.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.520]   It's just the right amount of, you know, just 10 minutes.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.360]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.840]   I mean, you do the PX90 thing.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.400]   I got sick and then injured.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.560]   So I've been off for about a month.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.360]   You can't do too much of that.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.760]   So I'm starting back up again in October.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.480]   Here's a man who really puts us all the shame.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.120]   This is a man who is in the peak of form.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.720]   He's fit.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.120]   He's agile.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.680]   And he's a good looking fella.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.080]   Got the best sideburns in the business.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.040]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.960]   Andy and I go.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.440]   I feel as though you're going to hit me up for a loan of some sort.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.600]   I know why you're thinking to be fine.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.040]   That's the second tricaster.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.920]   I love that.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.520]   Oookoo, oookoo thing you wrote on Saturday.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.280]   It was, you know, it was talk like a pirate day.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.200]   And Andy writes this whole thing.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.360]   And then he answers, talk like a pirate.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.280]   Oh, they said talk like a primate.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.600]   So it's very funny.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.760]   It's what they're thinking when they're saying.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.960]   [DOG BARKING]
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.440]   Did you notice that talk like a pirate day,
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.840]   it seems to have passed by at this point,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.680]   because it was big for a couple of years ago.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.400]   It was also had saturation last year.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.880]   This year, I saw more people doing, like, just
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.080]   being tangential about it.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.120]   Like, I mentioned it, and go, I'm doing talk like a--
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.160]   like, talk like Pontius pilot day.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.800]   I was supposed to.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.840]   Well, I'd like to let him go, but it is an election year.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.640]   I don't know.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.760]   I put another piece on my site, proposing that next year,
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.680]   on his birthday, we do talk like Paul Linde.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.360]   Oh, that would be great.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.000]   You know, where we're just all up like this, you know.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.920]   I would love that.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.880]   Well, you know, it's--
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.880]   I think what happened with talk like a pirate day is because people
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.040]   got tired.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.800]   So now they do it.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.120]   Just do a perfunctory hour.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.080]   That's it.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.960]   So it's going the way of most organized religion.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.160]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.560]   You go because I'm a dad.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.800]   Have you seen the pirate translation on Google?
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.000]   But Andy, did he still have it?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.560]   I think so.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.200]   Hold on.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.680]   Or they just have it up on the 19th.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.240]   I love to watch Mac Break.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.080]   Let's see what we got.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.360]   He's trying to translate it.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.840]   That's a bad Google search, man.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.360]   If safe search is off, that's a bad Google.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.840]   No, no.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.360]   He said--
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.840]   Oh, boy.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.600]   Alien.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.400]   I watched--
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.840]   I watched--
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   I watched--
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840]   --caught him right--
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.360]   --gah-r.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.120]   Where can I find me, bottle of rum?
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.840]   That's the talk like a pirate page.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.000]   But I think they did-- on the 19th,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.760]   you could get-- as one of the languages on Google,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.920]   you could get talk like a pirate.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.960]   That I care, particularly.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.960]   I'm glad that Google has so much free time.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.360]   Yes.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.880]   If I were one of those product managers, I'd say, well,
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.040]   apparently, I'm not giving you enough work.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.880]   Well, guess what?
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.400]   Android version 3.0 is due next month.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.280]   I just announced it then gadget.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.840]   Fine.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.280]   So we were talking last week about the Zoom HD
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.160]   and how it was a pretty credible product and blah, blah,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.200]   and they had apps, five of them, or whatever, eight of them.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.240]   But did you-- now, I haven't played with these apps.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.200]   Did you notice, Annie, that the apps on the Zoom HD
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.560]   have pre-roll ads?
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.000]   I tried-- I downloaded two games,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.480]   and none of them had pre-roll ads on them.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.840]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.600]   People were telling me that they'd download a couple apps
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.360]   and had that going on.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.160]   If every single app ever put onto the Zoom,
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.720]   I'm talking about commercial quality.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.320]   Apps starts with a 30-second ad. Even that wouldn't be good.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.000]   I mean, when I wrote my review, I was going from the total--
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.360]   almost total lack of any apps whatsoever on the day of rollout,
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.800]   plus the fact that I couldn't really find any firm evidence
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.120]   that Microsoft was really serious about building
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.200]   a serious app store and actually wrote out
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.000]   that we have to sort of pretend that there is not
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.440]   going to be any sort of third-party apps.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.480]   There might be some-- a few squirting out here and there,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.040]   but let's all just assume that the browser is all we get
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.080]   in terms of applications.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.200]   But I wasn't really as affected by it.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.720]   I really do think that if you buy it
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.440]   as a really great media player with a subscription service
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.000]   attached to it, then it's a very, very nice product.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.200]   If you're buying it-- if you want an iPod touch,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.560]   though, you need to get an iPod touch.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.400]   I don't think that's going to be a comparison for instance.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.480]   That's true.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.360]   If you want the app store.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.240]   Apparently, these ads-- this is a corner of ours technique.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.160]   I only show them the game.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.280]   So if you have-- you open chess, for instance.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.000]   You'll get a 30-second ad before you play the game.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.280]   That would make me insane.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.480]   Well, that would be a one launch thing.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.080]   You're it.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.720]   Never again.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.680]   I mean, half the reason I don't watch videos now
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.480]   that they've started to integrate them with new sites
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   is just because if I watch the video,
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.520]   it means I have to sit through a 30-second ad rather.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.200]   I just want to see--
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.040]   How long would you watch?
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.000]   I would--
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I'm trying to--
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.400]   We need some way to monetize.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.160]   Would you watch an pre-roll at it all?
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.560]   MTV did research and found that the most effective ad
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.600]   that they ran was five second pre-roll.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.760]   With somewhere in the middle, there
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.600]   was a lower third that popped up to remind you.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.000]   And that was the most effective thing
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.400]   that they had when they were doing their research.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.800]   And five or 10 seconds is fine.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.880]   Five seconds.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.760]   Something really quick that just brands it is fine for me.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.440]   But if I get this 30-second thing, I just--
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   in 10 seconds is on the outside border
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.920]   of what I'm willing to walk through.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.520]   Do you ever watch Hulu?
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.440]   I don't.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.760]   Mostly because of--
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.240]   For a while, I figured out how to deactivate the Hulu ad
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.120]   pipe.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.720]   There was a little plug-in that you could get that would just
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.920]   skip the ad.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.200]   And then, of course, I talked about it on this media.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.480]   And then, of course, don't talk about it.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.160]   I know, I know.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.800]   But you have to because it's your job.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.760]   But then you lose the access.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.360]   It doesn't like great problems.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.320]   I was just talking about this with some people
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.720]   just yesterday about one of my morning news sites.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.920]   It's a really awful, awful thing.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.040]   There was an embedded ad that was silent for the first,
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.600]   I don't know, like five or 10 minutes.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.760]   And then, like, I moved on.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.920]   I'm actually doing work processing.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.760]   And suddenly, like, an audio ad for the Wolverine DVD
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.520]   starts piping through my speakers.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.160]   And now, it's four times worse because now I have to stop
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.960]   what I'm doing.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.160]   I have to go back into Firefox, go through 20 open windows,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.920]   each with eight open tabs to find the one tab that's
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.800]   playing this commercial.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.200]   And I was complaining about this.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.720]   But basically, my reaction to that
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.280]   is simply say, OK, guess what?
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.040]   I'm not hitting your site for 30 days.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.680]   I'm not going to take that kind of risk.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.680]   And people are saying, well, why don't you use an ad blocker?
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.600]   And I'm like, yeah, but I'm worried
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.640]   that they're giving me free content based on the fact
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.600]   that they can put ads on this thing.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.720]   And if I put in a plugin that turns off all those ads,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.680]   I feel as though-- it's not like you're stealing,
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.280]   but I feel as though I'm sort of breaking my end of the deal.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.440]   It's kind of a solo contract or something.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.240]   And plus, given that Hulu gives me the ability to say,
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.920]   gee, I didn't even know the season premiere of "House"
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.480]   was last night.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.200]   I missed it.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.640]   Oh, great.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.400]   I can actually watch it for free on Hulu.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.240]   I kind of feel as though 20 seconds worth of ads
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.520]   is a perfectly good trade-off for that,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.160]   if they're going to give it to me on demand
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.880]   for many computers I have.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.360]   I don't think you're wrong for using ad blockers,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.120]   but that's just where I'd draw the line.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.720]   I figured that-- yeah, if anybody uses an ad blocker,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.120]   that's fine.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.200]   I just feel like that's part of the evolution in Darwinism.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.960]   Darwinism, as his phone goes off, speaking of Darwinism.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.000]   Speaking of Darwinism.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.360]   What should I do to punish him?
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.760]   I wish there were little electrical shock I could give you.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.640]   Perhaps that would help you keep in minding.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640]   No.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.040]   I worried at all about Alex.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.640]   He worried about an arms race, because as we develop better
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.440]   ad blockers, some people will think, well, now we
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.920]   have to make ads more intrusive, or we
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.480]   have to find a way to put ads in places
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.160]   where people can't escape them simply
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.200]   by virtue of the fact that we need to sell ads
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.600]   to make the service work.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.400]   Well, I think that part of the thing, though,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.920]   is that for me, I want to see them find more subtle ways
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.320]   of doing it, rather than more overt ways of doing it.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.840]   So the thing is that, yeah, in the model of we
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.240]   have to interrupt this program for 30 seconds,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.600]   I think that that's problematic.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.360]   And I do think that narrative has a much larger challenge here.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.640]   I think that there is a lot of ways for it to make sense
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.960]   to do as far as how-tos and a lot of stuff that we do.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.800]   There's a lot of ways to make that make sense
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.000]   from a business perspective where you can provide content.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.320]   And I don't think that when it's people talking about it,
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.720]   I don't have any problem talking about the ads.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.880]   And I think most of us don't-- I mean, a lot of people--
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.000]   we don't get a lot of complaints about--
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.600]   on our shows about talking about audible--
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.760]   We did originally.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.160]   Originally we got complaints, but people just kind of got used
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.360]   to it.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.840]   But I think it's more seamless.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.080]   I think it's this whole thing, like we're
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.280]   going to take you completely out of the thing
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.240]   and have this interruption that makes--
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.320]   It's the "Please Don't Squeeze the Charm and Model"
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.360]   where it works because it's annoying.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.200]   And I don't really like that.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.640]   I don't agree with that either.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   As my fact has going to talk about,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.680]   I think one of the smart things about having these five-second
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.360]   commercials is that by the time-- you don't really
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.560]   have time to get annoyed by it.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.720]   It's already come and gone.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.080]   It's annoying, but it's short annoyance.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.600]   I swear to God, every time there is one of these commercials
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.200]   for that for Microsoft's Bing search engine,
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.320]   as soon as I sense that it's a Bing commercial,
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.240]   I change the channel because, frankly, I
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.520]   don't want to listen to 30 seconds.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.640]   People saying, click, first person, the room
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.840]   will click with the algorithm, click,
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.040]   awesome deals on-- the point of the commercial
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.240]   is that you see what if real life were like a search engine
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.040]   results where you ask a simple question,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.160]   you just get the barrage by annoying stuff
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.200]   you're not interested in.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.280]   And the commercial itself is too damn annoying.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.560]   It was a good concept, but the only ones.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.440]   Yeah, again, I mean, I keep coming back to--
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.320]   if I ran on ad agency, I would have cast in bronze
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.800]   and mounted in every wall, in every conference room,
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.240]   that line from "It's a Wonderful Life."
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.840]   We're just-- Jimmy says that kid, oh,
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.880]   why don't you stop annoying people?
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.400]   Well, why don't you stop annoying people?
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.800]   Well, I think that if you make them entertaining,
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.880]   I mean, what's funny is, on my DVR,
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.400]   I'll sit there and be scanning through,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.960]   but if I see certain ads, I'll actually stop and watch them.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.960]   So for instance, I love Apple ads.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.920]   So I'll sit there and stop and watch them.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.080]   When I was watching Hulu a year ago,
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.360]   one of the things that came up there
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.840]   was a great holiday or a comfort in.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.880]   It was like getting out of your comfort zone,
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.560]   or do you want to get back into your comfort zone?
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.200]   And it was all these awkward moments.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.360]   And it was kind of like a 30 second version
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.760]   of curb your enthusiasm.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.600]   And it was funny.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.440]   I mean, it was funny.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.880]   And so I would actually sit there and watch them.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.280]   And you could watch the extra ones.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.880]   They had little things you could watch
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.240]   all six of them in a row.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.240]   And I actually watched all six of them.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.840]   Make a good left-hand people want to watch them.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.080]   The thing is, is that if you make it
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.720]   so that we're not going to bang you over the head,
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.560]   and we're not going to annoy you,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.040]   we're actually going to make it a 30 second short film
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.120]   that promotes what we're doing.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.400]   I think that you're going to get a lot of people.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.840]   Apple gets an enormous number of people watching their ads
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.240]   by choice on the web.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.520]   And that's the direction I think people need to be really thinking.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.280]   I didn't mean to turn this into this week in media,
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.960]   but it's an interesting conversation.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.720]   Are you all excited?
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.480]   Because Friday, you know, we get MMS.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.480]   I'm so excited.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.560]   I just can't hide it.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.360]   I'm so excited.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.120]   I'll be in the air.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.440]   Well, apparently some people got it early.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.640]   I didn't get it early.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.920]   But I wouldn't know if I got it.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.120]   I don't even know where to look for it.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.080]   Yeah, I wouldn't know how to--
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.400]   What happens if I'm going to show you?
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.200]   Yeah, how is it what it's going to look like?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.160]   Andy, you've used other phones.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.320]   How does this work?
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:34.880]   How does it work?
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.200]   This thing we hear of called MMS.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.840]   I was about to say that I've probably
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.960]   sent less than a dozen MMSs in my entire life each time
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.000]   just to figure out how the feature works on a new phone
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.800]   that I haven't used before.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.680]   It's just not part of my workflow.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.680]   Even my social workflow, there's no part of it that says,
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.880]   you know what, instead of just sending it a photo attachment
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.080]   to an email that they can get wherever they are,
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.560]   I'm just going to do something that's
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.520]   make sure that they can only get it if they're attached to a phone.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.440]   I'm going to use their bandwidth.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.920]   And I'm going to pay $0.10 to do it, too.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:11.720]   Speaking of iPhones, Google has now added push Gmail to the iPhone.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.400]   I've been using Google's sync, push sync, which they've kind of
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.400]   poses an exchange server.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.400]   And then they sync up the calendar and the contacts.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.720]   And I think that's just wonderful.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.360]   Do you use that?
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.640]   You have Google Calendar, Google Contacts.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:31.440]   You know, I'm starting to use Google Docs for a lot of our management stuff.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   But I don't use--
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.640]   I'm a big fan.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.760]   But what's cool is, before only Yahoo had push,
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.600]   and then if you had Google, you had to fetch it every 15 minutes.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.120]   Right.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.480]   Now, because of the sync feature, they're going to have--
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.400]   You can push it.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.280]   It'll push just like Yahoo does.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.800]   And this wasn't an Apple deal.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.040]   This was just Google figuring out how to do it and do it and do it.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.440]   That's the way--
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.480]   Now, they haven't gotten their phone app from a web-based phone app.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.280]   Yeah, have they?
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.040]   Did we talk about this last week?
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.360]   I don't think we did.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.800]   So Apple said that we didn't reject it.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.760]   We just didn't approve it.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.360]   We're still thinking about it.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.400]   So Google, the contents-- FCC and Google revealed the contents of their--
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.480]   of Google's letter to the FCC this week.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.240]   And Google said, no.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.240]   They said, no.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.480]   Phil Schiller called us.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.080]   Said, no.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.160]   We reject it.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.640]   It was rejected.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.920]   R-E-J-E-S-A-T.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.120]   So essentially, Google's kind of saying Apple.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.720]   Apple.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.240]   Phibbed.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:26.720]   Phibbed.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   Phibbed.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.360]   It could be a misunderstanding.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.640]   It could be Phil Schiller said, we're not
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.400]   going to put that on the phone.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.120]   And they thought that was rejection instead of just right now.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.600]   We're not going to put that on the phone.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.960]   But what did they say to the people--
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.920]   the third-party Google voice apps that were pulled, yanked.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.480]   Were those not rejected?
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.400]   Were they withdrawn for examinations?
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.040]   Or is this the case for all the apps?
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.320]   Maybe Apple never really rejected it.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.280]   They don't want anyone to feel rejected.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.920]   They just want them to feel like not now.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.480]   Not now.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.120]   I think they can get away with this and just say,
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.920]   well, no, it's just a semantic issue.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920]   But I don't think it's a semantic issue.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.160]   The easiest way to get away with it
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.080]   would be to allow it to exist.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.280]   Oh, they can't have that.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.880]   They can't have that.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.480]   Did you read the Google message and Apple's message?
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.800]   Did you, Andy, were you able to reconcile those in your mind?
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.320]   Not really.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.040]   It seems as though both are taking opposite positions
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.480]   because both feel as though they have something important to lose
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.120]   by acknowledging that, hey, look, we
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.640]   don't have to prove every single app.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.360]   We're not going to explain why.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.040]   We never explain why we reject any app, really.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.560]   I mean, Google-- big enough and old enough and strong enough
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   to go out, have a cookie, cry into your pillow,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.520]   and realize that you're still a very good, very big,
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.760]   successful company without having Google voice as an app
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.120]   on the iPhone.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.960]   Whereas Google is saying this is probably a very bad precedent.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.920]   We want to continue to work with iPhone
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.440]   because we find a lot of our developers
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.080]   are iPhone users, and we like having great iPhone apps.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.480]   And we would hate to continue to put effort and money
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.800]   into developing iPhone apps without any realistic understanding
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.960]   of if this thing is going to be approved or not.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.080]   So I really think that both of these people
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.280]   are aware of holes in their own positions
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.920]   and both realize that there's too much to lose
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   by simply saying, oh, come on, I suppose.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.520]   OK, we'll wait until 2010.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.440]   We have other things we can be doing with our lives.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.840]   The mic in our chat room says, it's
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.800]   like when a girlfriend dumps you.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   It's not you.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.240]   It's me.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.440]   It's not it's not you, Google.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.160]   It's us.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.240]   We just we're having trouble dealing right now.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.560]   We're going through kind of a thing now.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.160]   And you know, maybe just be friends.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.040]   In a relationship with a large international internet
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.720]   search engine company.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.200]   We just aren't ready for it.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.040]   We're it's us.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.480]   We're not mature enough.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.080]   Maybe you'll find a large Redmond-based operating system
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.280]   developer and then and software salesman
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.680]   that he can make you just as happy as we can.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.320]   Speaking of Redmond, Microsoft has started to attempt
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.120]   to lure employees away from Apple stores.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.720]   They're they're courting Apple store managers and staff.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.320]   Jim Dalrymple of the loop says that Microsoft has contacted
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.000]   a number of Apple retail store managers
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.960]   in an attempt to hire them away.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.240]   The employees have been a promise significant raises.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.360]   Some offered moving expenses.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.880]   You know, it's a backhanded price to Apple because it's saying,
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.480]   well, you're you've got the best employees.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.320]   We want to steal them.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.360]   But I absolutely don't understand that.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.560]   Are they suggesting that there is some sort of a battery
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.240]   farm in Cupertino or they've been like,
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.840]   genetically, actually, drinking Spanish?
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.560]   So that's the only place they can get
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.160]   start people who are good at their jobs.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.480]   The only place that's such an alien concept at Microsoft
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.720]   that they say, well, we just got to start off with,
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.360]   we got to start off with a couple of breeding pairs
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.040]   so we can start off and create our own.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.760]   Well, I think that there is there's a lot of heavy,
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.280]   I mean, training, I think that the training that a lot
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.360]   of the Apple employees go through from my understanding
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.480]   is much higher than you would see in most retail outlets.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.760]   And Apple, I believe the last statistic I saw,
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.520]   you know, makes more money per square foot
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.760]   or any other retail space in the United States.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.840]   I mean, it is a very, very successful process.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.520]   And so getting people getting a handful of people,
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.000]   especially the higher up you can get them,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.480]   that understand what the approach is, what is it,
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.840]   you know, because a lot of that theory and philosophy
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.720]   gets, you know, kind of trained of,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   this is how you approach it.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.400]   This is how you approach the customers.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.640]   And you know, the customer experience, I have to say,
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.160]   is someone who buys something from the Apple store
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.600]   at least once a week is about as good as it gets.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.080]   And they're a lot of, I mean,
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.760]   compared to other computer store experiences,
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.800]   they're just nobody.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.720]   - There's no comparison at all.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.280]   You know, and I think that that's what they knew
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.920]   just why all those other guys are out of business.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.120]   - Well, I think one of the problems
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.800]   that Microsoft is gonna have is that if it doesn't do
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.920]   at least that good, it is they're gonna fail.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.080]   And they're gonna look bad doing it.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.640]   - This is all because Microsoft is starting
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.120]   its own retail stores.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.320]   In fact, they hired George Blankenship,
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.960]   who's one of the guys who helped find the stores,
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.360]   the original Apple stores, you know,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.640]   find the locations, locations are very important.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.440]   They've already said that they're gonna go head-to-head
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.760]   against Apple in some areas.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.520]   For instance, Mission VA,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.800]   Ho California, a little mall called the shops,
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.080]   will have an Apple store and right across from it,
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.480]   a Microsoft store.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.200]   Microsoft's going to have its guru bar,
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.080]   where customers will be allowed to make appointments
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.480]   and ask questions.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.000]   - So basically they're gonna be off.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.120]   They're gonna be promising elliptical
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.000]   and largely philosophical answers
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.040]   to practical questions that you desperately needed
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:17.960]   and you'd answer to.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.240]   - Oh, yes, your guru's screen of death
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.320]   is like a bullet cherries.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.400]   - My son, when you are ready for the computer
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.280]   to find the printer, the printer will find the computer.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.680]   - There you go.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.640]   Is there anything else we can help you with today?
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.800]   - Also, somehow in relation to this,
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.240]   on Saturday, October 3rd,
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.880]   the employees of the Linwood Washington Apple store,
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.720]   say they're gonna walk out and protest at one
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.920]   in the afternoon on Saturday, Saturday's a big day, of course.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.120]   According to someone who's familiar with the matter,
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.200]   who contacted the Apple Insider blog
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.880]   at appleinsidery.com,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.160]   this will include the Mac specialists,
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.200]   the geniuses and the creatives,
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.960]   as well as former employees of the location.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.640]   One of the employees said the store's abusive management
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.240]   has potentially violated the law
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.800]   and alleged that Apple human resources
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.320]   did not conduct an investigation of the matter.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.120]   The person said that employees talked with the corporation,
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.080]   including Ron Johnson, senior vice president of retail,
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.560]   looked to no avail.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.120]   So maybe it won't be so hard to recruit
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.600]   those Apple employees after all.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.960]   - At least from there, they're not far away.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   The Alderwood store.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   Maybe that's their way of getting out.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.600]   They're all gonna protest them, they'll all be fired
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.920]   and they'll go work for Microsoft and they'll go,
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.240]   "I'll show you."
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.480]   Maybe this is all a secret.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.160]   - So how much of the success of the Apple store
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.160]   has to do with the fact that it's selling Macs
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.040]   and iPhones and iPhones and how much does it have to do
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:38.880]   with the staff?
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.720]   - I think it's a bit of both.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.640]   I mean, I think it's actually in many ways,
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.760]   it's more what you see people do.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.680]   The difference that I think an Apple store has
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.960]   is that it really is a place that you go
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.480]   when you have a problem,
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.960]   or when you're trying to figure something out,
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.920]   or when you're, we send people over all the time,
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.720]   "Oh, we can't figure out."
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.560]   You don't think about,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.440]   "I'm gonna really spend a lot of time
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.040]   trying to figure it out on my own.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.960]   I can just walk over and set up an appointment
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.520]   and go over there and have someone figure it out for me."
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.240]   And then you have people, a lot of people over there
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.160]   surfing, I mean, San Francisco is a tourist town.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.400]   So every computer is, which is a bit of an annoyance for me
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.200]   when I actually wanna look at a computer,
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.080]   but every computer is usually taken up
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.920]   in the Apple store.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.360]   Part of what keeps it so busy is that everyone's there
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.040]   surfing, checking their email,
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.720]   who was on a trip from Europe.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.600]   But all of those services increase foot traffic
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.920]   and when people are there, they're buying stuff.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.040]   And then the fact that you can buy from anywhere
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.360]   you don't have to stand in line, there's no line.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.200]   - There's never a line.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.360]   - If people walking around with a little order
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.200]   but they're not-- - Yeah, the order thing.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.040]   I mean, there is a line, but it's a virtual line
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.400]   'cause you make an appointment.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.240]   So I've gone in there where they say,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.320]   "We'll come back, we can handle you at 10.30."
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.320]   - Oh, whoa, but I'm talking about when you wanna buy something.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.680]   There's always, there's people just walking around
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.920]   with little order, you know, like these little handheld
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.760]   war things and stuff.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.240]   - It's a virtual line 'cause a lot of the people
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.360]   who are standing around in the store are waiting to be helped.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.960]   But they just don't-- - Right.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.360]   - They eliminate the queue. - That's the best thing.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.000]   I'm looking at a rack of cables trying to find
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.120]   the best way to hook up my eye chat camera to,
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.600]   my old eye chat camera to my new MacBook.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.640]   And right there in the spot, they find like the cable I need.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.360]   We have a discussion about old stuff,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.280]   far, far, far, far, far, far versus 800.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.680]   And after 10 minutes, we realized,
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.280]   "Oh, wait, we're just talking about hardware now
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.200]   "because we enjoy hardware."
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.240]   "Wait, yes, I will buy that."
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.760]   And right on the spot, yeah, I've made a purchase.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.800]   And I walk out thinking that they're gonna be tackled
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.520]   for shoplifting 'cause I'm just carrying out this package
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.120]   without a bag in it or anything like that.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   Yeah, it's a really, it's a definitely a different experience.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.760]   The difference is though, I really think that
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.880]   they're, this isn't healthy for the Mac community,
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.360]   but there still is a sense of identity
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.920]   that owning a Macintosh, owning an iPhone,
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.520]   owning an iPod makes you part of a group,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.160]   part of a certain community.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.080]   And having your own special clubhouse
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.320]   is something that Apple can really leverage very, very nicely.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.160]   I'm not sure that Microsoft people,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.960]   it's sort of like syncs, tubs, and toilets.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.000]   You buy it because you need one in the house
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.600]   and you use it when it breaks, you want to get fixed,
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.520]   but you don't have any particular emotional
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.240]   or society attachment to it.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.920]   So it'll just, I think it'll just become another computer store.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.720]   And I don't know how they're gonna have a Guru bar
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.920]   given that Apple has such control over every layer
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.800]   of the user experience that there's a limited number of fixes
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.960]   that they can be exposed to and problems they need to solve.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.120]   On a Guru bar at a Microsoft store,
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.520]   they're gonna say, okay, so what driver have you installed
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.720]   in the past three years?
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.880]   What card have you installed in the past four years?
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.520]   But sites have you visited in the past eight years?
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.640]   It could be any problem at any level
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.920]   and it's not gonna be a sort of thing
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.600]   where I'm gonna fix your problem
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.880]   in somewhere under 30 minutes and possibly under 10 minutes,
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.560]   which is the usual experience that I have
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.960]   and I hear from people about the Apple store,
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.920]   a genius experience.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.280]   I'm really curious to see how it's gonna work.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.200]   - How long before we start seeing stories?
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.680]   Oh, the gurus of the Guru bar couldn't help me at all.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.840]   - It's more leave it.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.800]   It seems like it's gonna be more like the central warehouse
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.640]   that services all the stores is also gonna have
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.040]   a huge service department that says,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.320]   okay, we ran the software, we put in the special red USB key
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.160]   that runs the diagnostics problem.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.760]   We can't immediately find the problem.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.840]   We're gonna need to keep it for three or four days.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.320]   And then again, I'm literally saying,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   - I'm not such a genius, just a guru.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:20.520]   Perhaps the computer wants to go home.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.360]   - With you.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.200]   - I really do think there's--
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.600]   - Why do you resist having change in your life
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.560]   when there are so many wonderful Intel Core dual machines
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.600]   preloaded with Windows 7?
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.480]   - Hey, I am having a Windows 7 party, by the way,
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.600]   and you guys are trying to--
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.880]   - You're having a Windows 7 party?
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.840]   - Well, Microsoft, and probably one of the silliest
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.240]   marketing efforts I've ever heard of,
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.760]   sign up with this company called House Party.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.840]   Did we talk about this last week?
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.120]   Where they do like the California Avocado Commission
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.320]   and stuff, and you're invited to have a party
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.560]   for these products, and they send you napkins
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.320]   and balloons and streamers and stuff.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.840]   And so Microsoft signed up with them,
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.760]   and they're having Windows 7 launch parties.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.280]   And you get a copy of Windows 7, if you do it.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.780]   You have to invite people, you have four parties
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.800]   to choose from, there's like Photomania,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.120]   and you have to have a theme.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:06.960]   You have to invite people.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.320]   - Are they streaming to you live, or--
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.220]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.040]   Oh, you're just having a party.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.400]   - No, in fact, there's a really funny video,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.480]   which I put on my tumble log,
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.800]   of what you should do at your party.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.760]   It's kind of sad, to be honest with you,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.120]   it's kind of pathetic.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.880]   - Lots and lots of drinking.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.840]   - Well, they do say, in fact, that there's a 21+
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.600]   version of the site and a under 21 version of the site.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.800]   - Is there like a centralized--
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.280]   - What's the centralized place?
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.120]   - Houseparty.com.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.200]   - So a software license key party
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.400]   that we've heard of from the '70s.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.240]   - Yes.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.080]   - They're moderate.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:36.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.720]   - You put your registration card in a big bowl.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.040]   Sometimes after everyone's been liquored up,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.360]   you pluck a bowl, a card out of the bowl,
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.600]   whichever one activates.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.160]   That's the person you hook up with,
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.880]   and you try to get on the internet with.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.720]   - Other than that.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.840]   - Your Windows 7, they do, in fact, encourage activities,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.080]   but they don't say what the activities are.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.040]   It's on my blog, if you,
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.120]   I could play a little bit of this Windows 7 houseparty video,
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.120]   but I'm gonna be hosting a party.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.560]   They approved me.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.160]   Probably not really thinking about it.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.440]   - When is the party?
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.360]   - I haven't decided, but I think the day--
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.800]   - Hey, welcome to the party.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.640]   - Thanks.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.360]   - The four of us, along with host worldwide,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.960]   and you are launching Windows 7 Ultimate Software.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.960]   So, you know what, let's take a minute or so.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.800]   (laughing)
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.720]   - She didn't even know what she was talking about.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.840]   She said, "Windows 7 Ultimate Software."
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.080]   - This looks like the infomercial
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.240]   for that magic bullet blender.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.680]   - Yo, it is, look, they've got--
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.320]   - Okay, Steve, they've got the black guy,
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.640]   they've got the blonde, they've got the older woman,
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.480]   and the geek.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.720]   - I'll load your pictures with this face, right?
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.560]   - Right?
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.400]   (laughing)
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.760]   - And you can even get a party pack.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.960]   Though you're in your own home,
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.600]   you'll be able to participate with others
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.040]   in this exciting event around the world.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.680]   - In a lot of ways, you're just throwing a party
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.560]   with Windows 7 as an honored guest.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.040]   Sounds easy, and it is.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.120]   (laughing)
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.960]   - Oh boy.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.800]   - Oh boy.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.120]   - You're very much in the power.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.040]   That's the guest that we're gonna have with Windows 7.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.080]   - And then she kind of starts to come up
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.280]   with things you should do, you know,
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.880]   and for your activities.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.480]   - You just look at them all and decide
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.720]   which one seems to be the most fun for your guests.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.840]   - Right.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.440]   - And some of the host notes, they list bonus activities.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.000]   - Oh yeah, they want to react, right?
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   - But you may want to--
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.360]   - I love those, you hear the guy that,
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.040]   I love those bonus activities.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   - I know, I'm sorry, I think I deserve you.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.800]   (laughing)
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.400]   - I was more excited that I had it than I needed to be.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.400]   - I love those.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.560]   So, I'm very interested in house party,
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.400]   just not maybe not this.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.560]   - It's an interesting idea.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.920]   - Well, we've been talking about a lot of this
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.600]   for like distributed conventions, distributed, you know,
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.320]   experiences and it's, I mean, so the model
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.720]   of doing a house party seems really cool.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.480]   I'm not sure if I'm gonna go to this one or do one of these,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.320]   but--
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   - Well, they have, let's see,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.880]   "Glory Foods, Release Your Inner Gloria House Party.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.720]   "Hunts Backyard Garden Fresh House Party.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.520]   "Sargentos Finishers Great After Party."
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.480]   There's quite a few of these, but anyway,
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.840]   so I applied and last night, I got an email saying,
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.560]   "Okay, you're a finalist.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.120]   "Go to our site, really quickly invite nine people,
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.360]   "choose your theme and as soon as it fills up,
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.080]   "you may not have a chance to go there right now."
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.160]   - I need an invite.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.480]   - Well, you have to apply.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.800]   Did you apply?
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.960]   So, I applied like two weeks ago and then,
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.800]   so I got the email, I went to the site real quickly,
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.880]   but apparently everybody got the email
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.480]   'cause the site wouldn't work.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.640]   And I was like frustrated, like,
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.640]   "How can I invite nine people?"
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.200]   I can't even get into the site.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.920]   And then I got another email like 30 seconds later
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.080]   saying, "You won."
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.600]   So, I guess it wasn't--
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.440]   - You all won.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.280]   - I guess we're all winners.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   - Everybody's a winner.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.840]   - So, and now I'm starting to get invitations
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.920]   'cause you have to invite nine people.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.200]   So, it's really like a chain letter.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.240]   It's actually very clever.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.080]   - Yeah.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.640]   - And so, when I get the pack of the streamers,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.680]   you're invited, you can come and we'll,
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.160]   they say, "Make sure you install Windows 7
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.720]   "before your party."
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.560]   - We can bootcamp it.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.000]   (laughing)
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.920]   - Why not?
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.800]   And then show your friends and they said,
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.160]   "Have the snacks first 'cause you don't want anybody hungry
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.560]   "while they're looking at Windows 7."
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.040]   - Yeah, you might have them gnat first as well.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.640]   You don't want to fall in sleep.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.480]   I just thought this was--
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.600]   - Just like any other Windows product is a complicated setup
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.120]   and then set up a guide instructions.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.120]   You have to follow step by step.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.440]   - Yeah, it's a little complicated,
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.000]   but thank goodness they made that video
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.840]   'cause that really, that helps me.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.880]   - Just make sure your guests don't see that video
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.720]   'cause they ain't coming.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.720]   (laughing)
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.720]   - They all just have.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.200]   I invited everybody on the show.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.040]   (laughing)
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.080]   - Sell a basic A, aren't ya?
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.440]   - So, I'm trying to decide if I should do it
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.320]   during Windows weekly.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.920]   Paul doesn't want me to do it during Windows weekly.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.760]   I don't know why.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.680]   - He should have one in his place
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.680]   and you could have one in your place.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.520]   - He's a fly too.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.360]   - You could have it together.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.360]   - We could have, yeah.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.200]   We have coast to coast.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.520]   - That would be awesome.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.880]   - Well, anyway, maybe we'll do it in the radio show,
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.360]   but I'm gonna do the party and when I, you know,
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.960]   I'll get a cake that says Windows 7.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.560]   They don't, you have to get that.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.640]   They don't give you a cake, but I'm gonna like go to the--
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   - You give them a graphic and have them--
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.480]   - Yeah, I'm gonna go to the store.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.720]   - Keep them a graphic and go crazy.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.560]   - Yeah.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.840]   I might give them this video.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   I wonder if they have like little, I think they do, like little flat panels you can bet in a cake.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   I think they could do that.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.840]   - What is this ice in the frosting?
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   That would be ozone.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   (laughing)
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.840]   - Anyway, yeah.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.840]   - It's a mid-software.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   - Oh, she's bad.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   - You know what?
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.720]   Let's take a minute or so to tell you about how great it is to host a launch party.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.280]   You can use house-burning tools to build your guest list.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.840]   Upload your pictures, which is his favorite.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   (laughing)
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.680]   And you can even get a party pack.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.280]   Though you're in your own home, you'll be able to participate with others in this exciting
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   event around the world.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.840]   - In a lot of ways, you're just throwing a party with one of those seven as an hunter.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.840]   - He just keeps saying that.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   I don't know.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   Maybe he's trying to rationalize it.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.760]   - Activities you and your guests can try it.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.760]   Your party.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.400]   And choose the ones that seem to you to be the most fun.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.600]   - There's a video of each activity from one of our parties, and we have tried them all,
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   right?
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.960]   So you can see how the activity runs.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.960]   And you know what?
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.120]   It's a handy page of notes to print out that tells you what you need ahead of time.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.520]   I mean, it helps guide you along with party, right?
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.040]   Print these out, because these are called host notes, and they're at the website.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.600]   Hey, again, you don't have to do that.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.120]   - Thanks for the printer work.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.120]   (laughing)
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.400]   - You might want to use Windows XP if you're going to print those out.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.400]   (laughing)
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   Don't install Windows 7 until you print those notes out.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.400]   (laughing)
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.600]   You're going to get a kid and play wig just to have that high fade going for the house
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   party motif.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.160]   And I did tell people if they come, they can come in and cost them as their favorite Windows
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   character.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   - Huh.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.640]   - I'm going to come as the paper clip.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.640]   - Clippy.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   - There'll be a lot of clippies.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.320]   There might be a few little dogs.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.600]   Anyway, we're going to take a break.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.880]   I think this is a good idea.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.480]   This is one thing where Microsoft has a leg up on Apple.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.760]   - I think that the house parties, I think this will be, I think this will be really
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.960]   fun for Microsoft.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.240]   I think that you could do these launches.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.920]   If you set up the launches as house parties and you gave people the live stream to Apple
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   keynotes.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.920]   - That, it would be-
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.560]   - But that's kind of what we do already.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   - We do.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   - I know kind of undermining that our own-
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.720]   - No, no, but they could watch us as the live stream.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   - We should do house parties if people could-
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.560]   - We could have twin house parties.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.520]   - Twin house parties around that would be fun.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.520]   - That would be fun.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.520]   - That is a good idea.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.520]   - That is a good point.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.520]   That's a great idea.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.680]   Like, I think what is the justification that Apple usually gives for not streaming these
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.680]   keynotes?
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   I think it's because of bandwidth issues, isn't it?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.680]   - Oh, I just crushed it.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.320]   - No matter how much bandwidth they have, they max it out.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.320]   - Is that why they do too?
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.920]   - No matter how much bandwidth they have, it gets used up.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.800]   - If they were to say we're going to have 500 slots open for a live stream and we will
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.280]   just take, we will, and give us a serious request, not just you and your house, but
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:26.000]   if you've got like 80 people at your office or if you've got a user group or you can get
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.320]   200 people in for that, we will just give 500 slots, 500 streaming slots to people based
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.920]   on, you don't have to buy special streamers, you don't have to have a special party game
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.400]   setup, but we will have live streams to 500 locations based on merit and that's what we're
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.400]   going to do.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.600]   - I think that Apple should really take advantage.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.280]   I think they should be streaming it to all the stores.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:50.680]   I think they should stream it to, you know, let value added resellers, let people like
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.200]   that authorize training centers and then just enthusiasts.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.280]   It wouldn't have to be 500.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.440]   It could really be, I mean, it could comfortably stream a high quality stream to 10 or 20,000
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.440]   nodes.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.920]   It's what they can't do is deal with hundreds of thousands.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.400]   You know, it just never works.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.040]   That's the, it might work now, but they gave up on it a long time ago because of that.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.600]   - If you think about it, just having a party is really just kind of multi-passing it.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.440]   You know, it's like M-bone.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.960]   - Let's take a break.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.800]   We're going to come back and talk more about Mac.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.720]   We also have our picks of the week and some new tablet news.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   Throw that in.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   - There's always, I don't know.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.720]   - Every week is re-end some new tablet news.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.720]   - They have tablet news.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.360]   Every week there's tablet news.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:39.320]   But before we talk about that, I want to talk about our friends at Carbonite now.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.520]   Mac friendly, Carbonite's been around for some time helping Windows users back up their
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.520]   systems now.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.720]   And you know, I kind of commend them.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:54.840]   They had a Mac client about a year ago and they said it's not Mac-ish enough and they
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:34:01.480]   went back to the drawing board because they really wanted it to be a great Mac client.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.200]   Now I don't think it's Snow Leopard.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.560]   You should check and see if they have a Snow Leopard version out yet.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.400]   And it does require an Intel Mac.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.160]   But I have to say, if you are using one of the new MacBooks, for instance, we should
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.240]   get this for Daisy Whitney who just switched.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.800]   A laptop is where you really need this.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.480]   You install it on your system.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.240]   In fact, you could try it right now free if you go to Carbonite.com and use the offer
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   code TWIT.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:28.840]   You can just install it for free and see how it works.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.560]   Well, and it will start backing up immediately over the Internet.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.520]   First actually encrypts.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.200]   Then it uses SSL to backup over the Internet so it's absolutely secure.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:43.960]   And it backs up all your vital files, unlimited amount of vital files, all your entire iTunes
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.120]   library if you want.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.800]   I got a big iTunes library.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.560]   Gigabytes, we back up our podcast.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.560]   Terabytes?
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.800]   Well, it has to fit on your machine.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   Okay.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   You can't like just kind of swap.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   I can't back my Drovo.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   You can't track your Drovo.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   No.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.040]   No, it has to be your internal hard drive.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.960]   See, it's people like you that ruin it for the rest of us.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.160]   Oh, unlimited backup.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   Great.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.600]   Let me just plug in my 18 terabyte drives.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.760]   I got an X-ray that's pretty full.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.400]   But I back up my podcasts on it.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.520]   And that's several hundred gigabytes at this point.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:23.440]   It's less than five bucks a month for unlimited backup of your irreplaceable files, your emails,
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.600]   your music, your pictures, your financial documents.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.360]   I think it's really important on a laptop.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.960]   I was looking at some statistics.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.600]   This is from a computer world study.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.800]   It's hard to believe this.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.560]   600 laptop are reported.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.240]   Lost or stolen at US airports alone every year.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:47.000]   It's 10,000 laptops a week.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.040]   Three percent of them, only three percent of them are ever recovered according to the
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   FBI.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.720]   You've got a laptop and you're not backing up to the cloud.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.920]   See if you're doing it with an external drive, you need to back it up to the cloud.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.600]   Carbonite is backed up since 2006 over 25 billion files, has restored 2 billion of them.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.560]   You can log into the carbonite site with your login and get your carbonite files, your backup
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.160]   files on any computer, Mac or PC.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.440]   No extra hardware required.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.640]   It's automatic and you can try it free right now.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.760]   Go to carbo and i-t-e dot com carbonite dot com.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.640]   The offer code is TWIT.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.040]   Now here's an extra special deal.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.280]   You have to do it and you have to do this in the right order.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.160]   Sometimes a couple of you will send me a note saying, "I bought it and I didn't get the
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.160]   two free months."
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:38.120]   You have to first sign up for the trial free using TWIT and then after you do that, if
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.480]   you decide to buy, they want you to do the trial first.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.120]   Just so make sure it works, does everything you want it to do, then if you decide to buy,
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.920]   you get two free months.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.160]   You have to sign up for the free trial from the home page to get the two months free later.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.360]   I just want to be very clear about that.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.840]   Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E dot com.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.720]   You don't even need a credit card to try this.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.640]   Use the coupon code TWIT and we thank them for their support.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.600]   This is kind of a test they're doing to see if Apple users back up.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.640]   Do you think, who do you think backs up less per capita?
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   Mac or PC?
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   Mac.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.640]   Mac less?
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   Yeah, less.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.080]   Do PC users have learned to back up?
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:21.720]   Yeah, I think that in many ways PC users are a lot harder edge than us.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   They have more challenges.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.880]   They've learned to embrace the pain.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   They've learned to embrace the pain.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880]   Exactly.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.320]   They've gotten good at that.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:35.560]   In some ways, I get concerned that I'm a little bit of a doe boy when it comes to technology.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.760]   This is like dealing with viruses and dealing with backups and everything else because that
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.520]   stuff happens to us less, which is good, but it's bad when it happens because no one's
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.720]   prepared.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:51.240]   I beta enough, for instance, that I save and back up stuff constantly just because I'm
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:56.680]   constantly afraid I'm going to corrupt files or my program is going to crash in the middle
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.320]   of whatever it's doing.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:06.640]   I know a lot of people that my wife will have 20-some applications open at any one time
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   because she hasn't turned them off for weeks.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.000]   She just turns them all running.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.320]   My wife's the same way.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.320]   That's where I go all around and I install a car but I'm like, "Fetch."
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.400]   For her backing up, we moved from her old computer to her new computer and she had to
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.040]   move like 200 megs.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.880]   There wasn't very much for her to move over so it's not that hard for her to back up.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.040]   For me, it's a little more complicated.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.600]   They see Whitney just got in the chat room, by the way.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   She's a switcher.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.920]   She hosts the This Week in Media show and she does a media minute.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.280]   She probably saw my eye tweeted.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.280]   She switched.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.280]   Yes.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.280]   She was a Windows...
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   She was a Windows...
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.280]   I was kind of surprised that anybody in her position would be a Windows 7.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   It was Windows 7 that did it for her.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.480]   She was just like, "Oh, couldn't take it."
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   She moved on.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.600]   By the way, people are saying, "Oh, I use Time Machine."
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.160]   That's fine.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.320]   The problem with Time Machine is you're backing up to another drive that's right next to your
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.840]   computer.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.800]   If the house burns down, you lose it all.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.520]   You have to have an off-site backup.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.640]   Some people will back up to Don Mac but Don Mac is still limited in size.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.640]   I'm making these hurt now.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.640]   It's 10 gigs.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.640]   I have more than that.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:13.880]   What you think about Don Mac is that it creates a 10 gig eye disc.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.200]   Oh, I see they use the backup program.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.960]   I don't like that Apple backup program.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   You use that?
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.960]   No, I don't.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.960]   You use it.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.240]   I'm very mean about it.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.440]   I like it because it fills a gap in...
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.560]   It fills an important role.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.880]   Not everybody has the forethought to think, "I've got a 250 gig drive.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.040]   I should buy a 250 gig backup drive just for backup."
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.520]   You want to encourage them to back up whatever they can, however they can.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.840]   This is one of the few back-and-be-till these that simply says, "Here's a list of checkboxes.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.920]   Click this box to include documents.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.960]   Click this box to include music."
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.200]   Or this one to just include the music you've purchased as opposed to the stuff you've ripped.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.320]   Now click this button and we'll do it every single day at this time or every week at this
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.760]   time to the media of your choice.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.360]   I think I got burned so long ago when it really wasn't.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.040]   It didn't work that I just didn't even try it again.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040]   I agree.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.240]   I think it was version two, version three, I think that first really caught on fire for
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   me.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.240]   The first couple were just, "Okay, great.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.320]   You've saved me the effort of having to drag an icon from one area to the other area
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.760]   on the finder as opposed to having really good utility."
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   It is true.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.960]   You do need multi-layer support.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   Superduper is...
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.560]   I use that to image my entire drive on a regular basis.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.560]   Me too.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   Love Superduper.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.560]   But I also use time machine.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.560]   I don't trust it.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.200]   I like Superduper.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.480]   I use time machine because all I have to do is not turn it off and it'll work.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.800]   On that basis, sure, I'll have that going.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.760]   It's true that you need to have offsite, you need to have onsite, and you need to have
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.680]   more than one, I think, piece of software running because you never know what will be
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.960]   screwed up and how.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.200]   The ideal version of a backup system is something that you don't even know that's running after
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.400]   you've spent one hour setting it up a year ago.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.120]   The only time you really start messing around with it again is when you get a crash or a
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.960]   theft or a fire or something.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.680]   Then you've this time to say, "Okay, let's see how well these three pieces of software
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   did."
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.960]   Cross your fingers and hopefully get a good result.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   Have you ever...
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.320]   Either of you ever lost something that you thought was back that this happens to me all
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.320]   the time?
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   All the time.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   Old stuff.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.560]   Because we've gotten really good at the last five years.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:27.640]   But when I look at old documents that I need from that I didn't have a backup process
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.280]   for, you think, "Oh, that movie's over there."
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.840]   And a lot of times it's like your kids' movies.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.240]   Like my work stuff I keep pretty well.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:38.200]   But it's like a movie of my kids or something like that at high res and all I have is the
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.120]   low res left and sad.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.560]   So anyway, Daisy backup.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.520]   That's all we have to say to you.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.520]   She's very happy.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.520]   She's a published novelist.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.520]   Published.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.520]   Published.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.320]   I think she's on a way to just get a deal to book out of the deal soon.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.360]   And she's got great calves as we were talking about.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.080]   I think that's why she's in the chat room.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.600]   I'm mad at me.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.360]   What you're talking about before this show?
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   Daisy's Facebook.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.360]   Patreon.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.840]   It's her own fault.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   Which is just your legs.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.600]   If you put your calves on your Facebook, you have to.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.200]   Hey, I'm going to get some baby cows and put them on my Facebook and see if I get the
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.440]   same result.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.480]   I don't think I will.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   Music groups.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.760]   Talk about this as you call this a serious WTF moment Alex.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.720]   Just like what are you talking about?
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:32.960]   Royalty groups, ASCAP and BMI are pressing Apple to pay performance fees.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.000]   Not only for song downloads.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.400]   By the way, these are performance fees.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.760]   Not only for song downloads, but also for videos.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.760]   I guess so.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.000]   That makes sense.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.840]   And 30 second samples.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.600]   So when you go to iTunes and you're like, what song?
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.560]   What is that Peter Gabriel song?
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.200]   Was it from Peter Gabriel 3 and you click on it and it plays?
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:01.360]   They want just the 30 second piece to decide whether you're going to buy it or not.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.440]   They'd like to have a royalty from that.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.560]   This is talking about unclear on the concept.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:13.200]   I mean, look guys, listening to this is how we decide whether we want to buy.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.120]   Now the key here is that ASCAP and BMI.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.200]   It's not a performance.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.520]   They don't make money on the sale.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.720]   So they don't care about what they buy.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.720]   They want performance royalties.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.080]   ASCAP and BMI doesn't get any money from that 20.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.600]   And from the, if you actually purchase it, they only get money on performance, which
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.360]   is of course why they're trying to get there two cents, probably a little.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.520]   Oh, I get it.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.520]   I get it.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.840]   So that's the only way they can make money.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.680]   That's the way that they make money for their representing the artists who make money
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.680]   from these sales.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.200]   The only when I found out about this, the, I had, I did have that whiskey, Tango, Froxtrot
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.520]   reaction.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.480]   But the only, the only saving grace of these organizations is to, and you almost say this
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:59.640]   like a patient mantra, like saying they're an industry organization, their job, their
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:04.840]   job is not to look out for the interests of the world, for the interests of their, and
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:09.200]   just, just like I want to, I don't want to trial attorney who, if I'm accused of a crime
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.840]   that gets sent me to jail, I don't want to judge you.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.280]   I don't want a lawyer who's concerned about what's fair.
[00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.720]   I want to, I want to lawyer who do whatever it is to take me out of jail.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:22.960]   On the same, but on the same matter, it's like, as I, of course, I have one of these awful
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.040]   thoughts that occurs to you when you get a piece of news like that, and then you have
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.160]   like an hour long drive somewhere.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:33.920]   And I'm basically writing this column in my head that if this thing ever gets traction,
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:39.080]   I will have to simply announce a sweeping policy change saying that before, I would never
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:44.480]   even hint us to instructions on how to download music illegally, because that's universally
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:48.080]   wrong and it's unfair, but if you're trying to get money out of me for listening to a
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.640]   30 second song sample, if you're trying to get money out of me by virtue of the fact
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:56.680]   that I watched something on my own screen that I had actually purchased, then I'm, I
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.640]   would really have to consider saying, you know what, piracy is now fair.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.640]   It's now fair game.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.640]   I'm, I'm, I'm.
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:09.240]   I guess that's really the risk for these groups is it's important for them to understand the
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.920]   competition is not the other record company.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.520]   The competition isn't the other music store.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.240]   The competition is Pirate Bay.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.240]   Right.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.600]   The free version of the song that everybody's now knows how to get.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   Right.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.200]   And, and if you push it too hard, I think people are honest, they want to pay for a song,
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.760]   but if you push them too hard, come on.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   Well, yeah.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.840]   And, and the thing is, is that the reason I to use it successfully, specifically because
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.400]   it's easy, it's fun.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.840]   It's, you know, and it's just quick, you know, you can do it or, or Amazon, there are many,
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.440]   many, many, many songs that I would have never bought if I couldn't play the sample.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.000]   And it doesn't make business sense to start paying a tenth of a cent or whatever.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.800]   Every time someone plays a sample to decide whether they want to buy it, that's just insane.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.720]   You know, it's, it's cutting your nose, it's spite your face.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   It would come out.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.120]   I can't imagine Apple would bill you.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.640]   It could come out of their proceeds.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.080]   I'm saying it doesn't make sense for Apple or Amazon to be sitting there paying every
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.640]   time someone's just sampling the, you know, no, it's like Apple says, what are you talking
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.640]   about?
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.400]   Well, it'd be like every time I, I want to, I look, I search in Amazon and I see a book
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.400]   cover.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.520]   You know, that, that the writer gets a royalty.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.080]   You know, every time I read the description, there is no description of the song.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.960]   The only description of the song is a 30 second sample.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.960]   Right.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.000]   How can you describe music?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.640]   Uh, somebody else who wants money, Wall Street Journal is going to start charging for iPhone
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.640]   content.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.280]   I've not used the Wall Street Journal's iPhone app.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:37.040]   It looks a lot like New York Times iPhone app or, you know, all these others, but they
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.280]   according to paid content, you know, Rupert Murdoch has been saying this for a while.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.520]   We're going to, we're going to put up a paywall.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.120]   We already make money on the financial times in the Wall Street Journal charging subscribers.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:50.640]   Now they're going to charge Blackberry and iPhone users $2 a week to read new news, $2
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.920]   a week to read news on the iPhone.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:57.160]   I actually mean, I just really have gotten to the point where I don't need, I don't need
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.000]   content that I have to pay for unless they can get everybody to do it, but they really
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   have to get everybody to do it.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.480]   I just go to the New York Times or CNN.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.120]   You know, I stopped.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.840]   I just kind of stopped reading it at Wall Street Journal.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.640]   I'm also saying this is, this might scare you more.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.200]   Actually, it won't scare you, but it might scare me more.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.880]   Murdoch has also said News Corp is considering a pay per view or subscription model for Hulu.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.080]   That's what, that's called iTunes.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:28.080]   I mean, you can watch these stuff without, can you charge for something you've been giving
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.080]   away?
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.520]   I don't think you could start charging for something you've been giving away.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.520]   I think you could.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:39.160]   I think if you, if someone can log in and not get the ads and pay $2.99 or $1.99 or whatever,
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.880]   I think they could do that.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.760]   I mean, there are a number of people.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:48.120]   I think of all the apps that are supported by Adware that it's not that the ad annoyed
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.880]   me so much that I finally bought the paid version, but it's more like, do you know what?
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.080]   I really like this app.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.080]   I really like this app.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.520]   I'm kind of rely on it on a daily basis.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:00.920]   And for just two bucks, I get to a support that I, for two bucks to get the slight extra
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.760]   feature that I know will be worth it.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   So, I mean, if I were really, if all my viewing had switched to Hulu and I found out that
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:13.320]   for $10 a month, I can get all the content and no ads, that might be a valuable thing
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.320]   for me.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.640]   For me personally, though, the more likely thing would be kind of like what Alex is saying
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:21.520]   that I would find a way not to really use it anymore.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.840]   There's difference between the things that you love that you absolutely can't get by
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.840]   without and the things that you use because it's convenient and it's affordable.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:36.240]   I really can't get by without my Netflix, but Hulu, I lose a very convenient safety
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.280]   net and a very convenient way to watch TV, but that's fine.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   I don't want to be stealing content from you, NBC, Universal, if you think that that's what
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   that's fine.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.280]   I just won't give you any money.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:52.560]   I think that the Wall Street Journal is one of the few examples of a paywall that's worked
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.720]   because people make money off of the information from the Wall Street Journal, right?
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.720]   So you could...
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.720]   Well, sometimes.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.720]   Sometimes they lose...
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.760]   But also your company pays for it usually too, right?
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.600]   I mean, I actually am a paid subscriber to the Wall Street Journal because I wanted to
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.840]   be able to read those articles online.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.880]   Well, and especially if you have control over that, I know that we used to pay.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.280]   I think it was an incredible amount of...
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.400]   Oh, it seemed like an incredible amount of money at the time.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:19.320]   $250, $300 a year for like College of Music Journal and album network and so on and so
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   forth.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.840]   And that gave us all the charts and all the real insight in this information.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:27.200]   And when you have some special information like that, it's easy to write that subscription
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.680]   or have your company write that subscription.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.600]   I wonder, I often wonder if we haven't gotten...
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:37.200]   We didn't get condition as kids to getting music for free from the free radio if there
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.360]   would be so much of a problem with piracy because we just...
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.880]   We kind of have that expectation now.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.720]   Well, it comes in for...
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:44.720]   Music is free.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.920]   But I think the problem really is that there's a lot of people that are able...
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.160]   I mean, our generation is still paying for it, but I think that you get to the next generation.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   I buy music like crazy.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.960]   Yeah, I buy a lot of music and I don't have any...
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.600]   I don't have any problem buying the music.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.960]   And I buy them on a whim.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.560]   I want to remember a song.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.000]   I'll buy one for 99 cents.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.080]   I just want $1.39, whatever.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.600]   I'll just play it once and decide and maybe play it a couple of times.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.760]   I got my money's worth that of it as far as I'm concerned.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:11.600]   But the real problem they have is the next generation, the generation that's been made,
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.880]   the criminals that have got used to this generation.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:18.560]   And when you make so many laws and you enforce so many arbitrary laws, they become worthless.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:21.160]   And I think that's the problem they have is they have a whole generation coming up that
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:25.000]   is not interested in paying for this.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.680]   I think the bigger problem is just that we accept the idea that copyright and material
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.520]   is stuff that has to be paid for in some fashion, either by watching ads or by paying
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.600]   money at a new standard in a store.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.680]   That's partly because that's how we grew up.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.480]   We never knew a world in which that was not true.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.560]   The big lose for all these industries is that there's an entire generation that become
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.120]   disconnected from that simple frail concept.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.120]   That it's not that they're stealing.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.800]   It's just that, well, why would I...
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.200]   Why are you trying to make me give you money for something that's supposed to be free to
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   begin with?
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:04.240]   I've just like I got fairly annoyed a number of years ago when at Fenway Park, they started
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.600]   putting big ads on the green monster on the top of the green monster like that big left
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.600]   field wall.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:13.200]   And I thought, oh, this, that's how horrible the world is today.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.880]   Now, there's nothing they can't put an ad on.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.200]   That's not supposed to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.680]   And then of course, if I look at historical photos of that same law for like the teens
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.120]   and the 20s, it was plastered with ads.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:28.000]   There was not a square inch that did not have an ad for gum or cigarettes or Coca-Cola
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   or anything.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.560]   But the fact that these walls were not covered with advertising when I was a kid, when I
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:37.560]   first got to know them, means that I'm not willing to accept all those ads there today.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:42.320]   And that's what's gonna be the problem with newspapers and magazines, comics, everything,
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.320]   music.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.160]   How do you feel about this?
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.720]   Matt Newberg writing in the tidbits points out that Snow Leopard, this is kind of the
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:54.360]   end of the line for a venerable feature that came from the very beginning of the Mac, is
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.160]   dropping document creator codes.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:02.640]   I remember that in the old days, until like a month ago.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:09.440]   Back when I was a kid, you would, as a developer, you would invent or, you know, and there
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:16.760]   was, I think, a clearing house of four character creator code that was yours for, you know,
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.520]   per application, I guess.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:23.400]   And it would be stored in the resource fork of the, this is part of the problem is that
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.520]   resource and data forks are kind of going away.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.720]   And the resource fork of a Mac file that would say, this is who made this file.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:35.400]   So barring other information about what to launch, what would application launch, launch
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.400]   the creator of the application.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.760]   You guys have been driving me crazy half the time.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:49.240]   The Apple documentation says, if the document, so the Apple documentation says you should
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:55.920]   look nowadays, look at the extension and go by the extension, which is the windows way
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.920]   of doing things.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.520]   So, but so dot move.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.320]   And so then you just have a rule that dot move is always going to be open by time.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:06.960]   And that's why when you do a get info and you say, open this file with this application,
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:11.160]   there's that checkbox that says, change all what you're doing is you're adding an entry
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.560]   to the database that says dot moves.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.840]   I want them to be open by VLC, not quick time or whatever it is.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:22.400]   And from then on, based on the dot three letters, you know, the file extension, this
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.680]   is Windows style and Unix does.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.920]   I mean, I would prefer this.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.200]   Well, this is what they're moving to.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:31.520]   It used to be that it would look at the creator code first.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:35.560]   And if there wasn't a creator code, they don't look at the doc, you know, the doc.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.400]   Because every time I every time I double click on a move that was created by Final Cut, it
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.800]   opens Final Cut when all I want to do is view it in quick.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.920]   Here's the issue.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.840]   It comes up for me with text files.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.200]   So I've created text files with a variety of different tools.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.520]   Coda, if I'm using it or an HTML file for the web, I might use text made if it's a
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.160]   note file.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:00.200]   I wish I could say this kind of the ones I created with text made open and text made
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.360]   the ones I created in Coda open and Coda, but you can't now.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.200]   So now I'll up now ignores the creator code and says, well, it's dot text.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.400]   It opens with whatever your default is for dot text.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.400]   Right.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.240]   Or you can right click it and you can right click it.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.240]   Select.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.240]   Yeah, select it.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.240]   So it's more like the windows.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.760]   I thought the I thought the creator code was actually kind of inspired thing, but you
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.840]   know, I don't I don't know if this is a bad thing or not.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.560]   I think some developers are unhappy about it.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.280]   I think they're I just made a use case for it.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.520]   Why does it make you crazy?
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:31.240]   Because because it opens the create like I don't want JPEGs to be opened by Photoshop,
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.040]   even if I save them by Photoshop, but you could tell, you know, but then I have to go
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.920]   in like I just wanted to be if I really wanted to be open by Photoshop, I'll right click
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.200]   on it and I'll have Photoshop open.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   That's a good point.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.160]   It's a good point because Photoshop is such a big.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.240]   It's a long launch and so final cuts a long launch.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.320]   And so now I have to wait for that and quit it or whatever.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.720]   And so I'd rather just when I double click on the ones I'm most sensitive to are pictures.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.520]   When I double click on something, I really generally wanted to open and preview.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.080]   If it's an image and it's a movie, I wanted to open in quick time.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.560]   I don't want those are the things that I deal with the most that open the wrong application.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:06.200]   I love I love these conversations and I think these are the most interesting conversations
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:11.240]   of all in computer software development because it's really getting down to fundamentals about
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.640]   well, how do users use it?
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.640]   What's the best?
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   What's the logical and I way to do it and there are different ways to do it.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:16.880]   I right click constantly.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.760]   So I right click every I right click all because this drives me nuts.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.440]   I I'm just used to right clicking and saying this is exactly what I want you to open it
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.440]   with.
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:27.040]   You know, if you open a, you know, it'll be interesting to see what you do.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.000]   Like if you open a doc, you know, a doc, you know, that's because you from your point
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.480]   of view, a JPEG is a JPEG is a JPEG.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.320]   You don't care where it was created.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:40.680]   But my example, sometimes you do care where it was created.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.200]   Not all text files are alike.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:46.200]   My example, not all JPEGs are like and you do care and you'd like Apple to the Mac to
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.360]   do the smart thing.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.360]   You could override it.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.080]   Well, I guess I in the, you know, in leopard, you could override it.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.160]   You could say, no, no, open them all with, you know, preview.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.360]   I guess what I mean, what I'd prefer is to if I just double click on it, open it and
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   preview, if I right click on it, I'll tell you where I want you to open it.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:04.240]   You know, if I have a doc, like right now, for instance, doc files open and text edit
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.160]   or whatever, but I want them to open a page just because the text edit blows them into
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.160]   little bits.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.960]   You know, so text edit, you know, it did anything special in a word file and text edit is going
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:18.240]   to blow the thing into little bits and pages has a better chance of surviving that interaction.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   I guess, you know, you win because Apple has decided to go with your method.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:25.600]   Well, you know, I told them I went down from meeting and I said, okay, here's the deal.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.600]   Get rid of all these.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:27.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.600]   Name you.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.240]   Is there a better way to do this though?
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.120]   I'd love to hear from our audience.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   Is there another solution?
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.600]   I bet John Gruber has an opinion on this.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.520]   Maybe we get Gruber on next week and ask him.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.480]   He's a developer, but he also has a lot of opinions on these kinds of things.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.880]   Is there a better way?
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:47.920]   I think part of the solution is just the simple fact you can add spotlight attributes that
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.160]   cover just about anything to any file.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:54.680]   So if it were important for as the develop has the creative Adobe Photoshop, if it were
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:57:00.240]   important for me to associate not only who I am, what I created with them, all of the
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:04.480]   sort of stuff, I guess I could just add more, get info, attributes for it.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.600]   And so then the finder can then support it through searches.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.280]   But the only thing that I care about is that it's a piece of information that we used to
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.680]   have that we no longer have.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:16.960]   And then I'm sort of on the, as a general rule, I'm like, well, give me a good reason
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.040]   while we're losing a piece of information that could potentially be useful that we have
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.520]   25 years with experience with.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.360]   Also, a lot of novelty license plates on a lot of different developers are now going
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.360]   to be just asleep.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.280]   I have lots of friends.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.280]   Really?
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   Do they have their creator code?
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   Is their license plates?
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:40.280]   It's their because it's not only like the file type code, but it's also like the distinct
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.680]   creator code for you and your software company.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:43.680]   It's unique.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.720]   And there used to be, I had a part.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:49.880]   There was a partnership that I think fell apart because they couldn't decide who gets
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:54.520]   to like own the license plate with that four letter four letter code on it.
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:58.440]   So granted, that should probably not be the highest priority in deciding whether or not
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.440]   a basic feature of the file system should be kept intact.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:06.200]   But still think of the human element.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.200]   Think of the children.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.200]   Ah, hell with the children.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.400]   It's always that Apple tablet is due in February, electronic star.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   Everyone's sure about this now.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:16.400]   I'm ready.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:22.600]   You know, it's interesting that Apple tablet will be ready around Mac world after they
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.720]   stopped going to Mac world.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.720]   What do they do?
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:28.220]   They don't like to be rushed.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.220]   But they won't announce it at Mac world.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.520]   They'll announce it like the week before Mac world.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.800]   They'll have their own little show and now it's like one week in advance after everybody
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.760]   has their hotel reservations.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.760]   Exactly.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:47.320]   So the latest detail from Taiwan's electronic or economic news, is that right?
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.280]   That's what it says here on the electronics to site.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.280]   Economic news claims.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:55.160]   And then the way this is where we're getting on the leaks now is from these parts guys in
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.160]   Taiwan.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.200]   Hardware is slated for February.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.120]   Companies will start shipping parts in December.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.640]   Near 10 inch touch display, tablet will be based.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:10.880]   Now this is a little interesting on a custom processor, likely arm based from a recent acquisition
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:16.400]   PA semi will have built in HSDPA for 3G access.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:21.200]   That's AT&T system not Verizon.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.240]   A long lasting battery.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.240]   I put that in quotes.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.800]   I mean, let me do the air quotes.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.600]   A long lasting battery.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   More than 10 minutes.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.240]   It doesn't think that talked about its landfill property.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.520]   It will never go in the landfill.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:40.640]   And a price point somewhere between drumroll, please.
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:42.640]   799 and 99.
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:46.160]   That sounds about right.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.160]   That's a big between.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.000]   I'd say it's a big difference.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   99.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.480]   That's what I was really thinking in the ballpark.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.280]   I don't know.
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.320]   It's there's so real.
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.280]   A rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:06.440]   There are things that make me not suspicious, but basically make me shove this a little bit
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.680]   to the side.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.640]   It can't be $999.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.320]   It cannot be $999.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.120]   It has to be $700 tops, I think.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.360]   And I think that's I would guess that's probably what they're shooting for.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:24.880]   Two, I think would be silly if this device didn't support 3G in some fashion.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:30.920]   I think it would be hard slappingly stupid if you could not buy the if your reward for
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.560]   spending $750 for this device was now you're on the hook for 40 bucks a month for two years
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.400]   to get the 3G going.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:44.880]   My guess would be that's going to be a less expensive unit and that 3G will be an option.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.960]   Or maybe the 3G chips that will be in there, but you don't necessarily have to buy 3G access
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:54.680]   if you're sufficient with just getting access by a Wi-Fi.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.400]   Existing suppliers like WindTech, which does the touch screen for the iPhone, which I guess
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.440]   eliminates any thoughts of an OLED screen.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.280]   I really like the OLED in the Zoom.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.280]   It's beautiful.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.080]   I would love to see an OLED screen.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:11.360]   As well as power equipment supplier MagLayers Scientific.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.080]   MagLayers Scientific Techniques.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.400]   I guess that's one company I don't know.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.680]   Or is that to be part of the production effort?
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.760]   I guess this all makes sense, but where does this leave Verizon?
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.760]   Unhappy.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:26.760]   Frustrated.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.600]   Well, the Verizon CEO seemed pretty sure that they were going to have something.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.520]   Yeah, well, that's another big problem that Apple is not the only guys who are working on
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.680]   a tablet here.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.880]   We all talked about the Archos 5 last week and that was the device that at least for the
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:46.080]   half hour that I was using one a couple weeks ago, I was very impressed with.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.600]   It's going to, I don't know what an $800 Apple tablet is going to have to do to compete
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:57.960]   with a $500 shipping right now Windows 7 tablet or a $400 or a $300 tablet that runs Android
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.920]   that's smaller, more convenient, more affordable and better suitable as an accessory to whatever
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.520]   you're using right now.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.960]   So I wouldn't say that Verizon would be terribly worried about not having support for the Apple
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   tablet.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.800]   And I would simply say, we'll just do ad hoc when your deals with every other company that's
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.800]   doing tablets.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:19.280]   We'll have a tablet every single year and we'll probably be able to deliver them at a better
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:26.280]   value for consumers than, again, if Apple is, if you did say that it is a very wide range
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:32.400]   of price points here, but if it's an $850 tablet, that's going to be a really hard sell for
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400]   anybody.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.720]   No one's going to walk into a phone store saying, please give me an $850 tablet.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.000]   They're saying, please give me a free netbook with a two year contract with your data network.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.120]   But I think that's what everyone said when Apple came out with a $699 phone.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   Or, I mean, was it $699 or $599?
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120]   What did I pay?
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:56.160]   As you have accurately pointed out, many times the actual cost is not the price up front.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.840]   No, but we did when we all got our iPhones, the first round, we, we, it was really, it's
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:07.840]   going down 699 or so, 599.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.200]   The first iPhone was 599.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.200]   Was it really that little?
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.840]   And they had a lot going around the block.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.480]   That's why I think that 899, 879 is not that big of a deal.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480]   What happened?
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.480]   What?
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.560]   30 days later, 60 days later, they dropped the price $200.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.920]   They wouldn't have just, they're not just going to give away $200.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.440]   So they think, oh, we can sell these forever for $599.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.600]   I do have that $100 gift certificate that Apple gave me last.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.600]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600]   I still haven't used that.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.560]   I wonder if it's probably expired.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.760]   I mean, if it's got a sell, if it's got true sell, it's going to be, I think, I think
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:43.800]   Apple has figured out that this model works is to have AT&T pay subsidized, subsidized
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.600]   it and get, well, I'd be much more interested in a Verizon based tablet though.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.600]   Oh, I'd love it.
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.280]   I'd have a, wouldn't you?
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   Yes.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.360]   I, you know, I think it also makes it difficult as somebody pointed out in a chairman to sell
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.360]   it worldwide.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.120]   You build in some 3G method, I guess it could just be a swappable part.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.200]   But you know, you have to make it compatible with the carriers and every company.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.960]   You can get, you can get chips.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.560]   We had actually call com makes a chip.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.560]   That goes all the way.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.560]   Go be is universal.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.480]   You can go to EBDO, you can go to, you know, all the different.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.840]   It would have to be a go be.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.840]   That would, that would solve that.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:25.760]   Well, I'm, I am still, I'm, you know, I've been wrong so many times in my life about it.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.640]   I just think you should buy someone else's tablet.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.400]   I was wrong about the stores.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.960]   I thought that would be a flop.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.680]   I was wrong about this move to Intel.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.120]   I thought that would be a flop.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.960]   I'm going to go out on a limb here and say, I think these tablets, this is going to be
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:38.960]   a flop.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:39.960]   I think they're going to be huge.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:40.960]   I think it's a flop.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:41.960]   I don't think anybody wants them.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:47.880]   Oh, I think it's a, I think it's crazy talk that Apple's going to lose their shirt on
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.880]   this.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.240]   I don't think nobody wants these at all.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.880]   Why do you want, what do you want it?
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.960]   Well, explain to me.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.960]   I, because go ahead.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.960]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960]   Go ahead.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.200]   I was just, I was just going to say that Apple's biggest advantage is that they're going to
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.080]   do a tablet the way that it should have been done to begin with.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:07.440]   That just like again, they were the first company to do a smartphone with a touchscreen
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.400]   that really made sense.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.800]   It didn't, it wasn't a smartphone with a touchscreen.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800]   It was an iPhone.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.320]   Just like this device is not going to be just another tablet computer.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.600]   It's going to be whatever they're going to call it, an iTab, whatever.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.360]   Can't be the iPad.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.720]   We keep getting email from somebody says, you're kicking, you're calling the iPad.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720]   Alex is wrong.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.480]   His Fujitsu has a trademark on that.
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:33.360]   You know, again, some people need to have a cookie and back away from the keyboard system.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.360]   Relax.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:42.360]   I'm just, I, this is another moment where I have to just like back away from the keyboard
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.360]   acknowledge that I am but an imperfect vessel for the universe's perfection and realize I'm
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.640]   not going to understand what they're going to do until I actually see the thing.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:57.000]   I'm just having a great deal of trouble imagining how they could really navigate an $800 tablet
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.080]   through the marketplace without having an incredibly compelling reason why.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.640]   Here's why you're not going to be, here's why this tablet is going to be your next notebook.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.480]   Here's why this is going to be your next desktop computer.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.760]   Here's why you're instead of buying that second computer for your house to back up the one
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:15.920]   that you have at your, at your office, you're just going to have this tablet that will automatically
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.120]   receive projections of every single feature from your desktop Mac back at the office into
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.120]   this.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.600]   It can't be like anything that we've seen in the tablet form.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.400]   If they're really going to be charging a hundred bucks word, I'm with you and I haven't
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.480]   seen the secret sauce yet.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.800]   I don't, I don't, that's, I think that's it.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.880]   Is that we've seen these, we've seen the UMPC.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   We've seen the no key.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880]   We've seen a tumma.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.800]   So what is the secret sauce is the question?
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.200]   What was the secret sauce for the iPhone?
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.040]   It's the interface and the access to the iTunes store.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.880]   There's a touch screen on the iPhone and then the app store in, in year two.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.920]   But I think, but this is going to come out with all of that fully loaded.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:53.920]   I mean, I know as a, as a developer, you know, we will be looking at developing very, very
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.960]   quickly stuff that's for our film industry, but I just think that there are so many uses.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.600]   The problem is the iPhone is just a little too small.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.680]   And I think there's a lot of people who use an iPhone that if, if you had something that
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.000]   was just a little bit bigger, this gets it a little away from personal space.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.920]   Like when I'm watching a movie, you know, I really need to hold it up to see it on my
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   iPhone.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.640]   I set it down somewhere and be looking over and it's like my personal media, you know,
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.040]   assistant that has the stuff.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.160]   If I'm cooking, I could be sitting there watching how to's about how to make my chicken
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   cord on blue.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.440]   If I'm, if I'm changing the oil, I could have a little thing there.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.680]   If I'm putting together an Ikea furniture, I could have something there.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.280]   If I'm watching Oprah, I can, I wouldn't be watching him.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:37.640]   My wife could be watching Oprah, you know, doing that stuff or, you know, I think that
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.080]   that's the most people that's going to be a little hard to do, you know, it's going
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.240]   to be a big, it's going to, I'm telling you, it's the answer.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.200]   If I could wave it at the Ikea box and the instructions would be on it, you know, maybe
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.960]   it's something like that, but that's not going to come out at a day one anyway.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.160]   No, but I think that I think that there are so many apps that would be much more interesting
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.040]   at a slightly larger size and it's going to be, it's going to be huge for tactical pants
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.960]   and cargo pants and Scotty vests, because you know, you're going to need a bigger pocket
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.520]   and people will make them.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.520]   All right.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:11.040]   But at that for $800, you still don't get a little kickstand that will let it prop up
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.040]   on your desk.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.000]   I bet you, I bet you anything.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.240]   No, no, no, no, no, someone will make one and it'll be like a little hard in case with
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.480]   a little kickstand and then we'll all buy those to me.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.480]   They should just talk to our folks.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.480]   It'll be the third party opportunity.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.440]   Well, no, it'll say, well, you know what, we actually had a really cool solution for
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.440]   that in the prototype, but someone at top decided that that would destroy the beautiful
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.920]   lines of the smooth back of it.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.360]   So they decided not to put it on top.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.440]   I was in the, I was in the hardest.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.040]   I was in yoga today and the instructor said, if you're doing this pose correctly, there
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.480]   will be no wrinkles in your outfit.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.960]   And I thought, now I know where Steve Jobs gets it.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.160]   Bruce Sewell is the new general counsel at Apple.
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:58.120]   He came from, he replaced Daniel Cooper, came from Intel where he was general counsel
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120]   of Intel.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.320]   I don't think that means anything though, doesn't.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.320]   He's just a lawyer.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.560]   He means he knows what he's doing.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.560]   He understands technology.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.560]   There's a lot.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.160]   Apple has, you know, legal department has a lot to do besides shutting down.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.880]   That science has a lot of the department of justice investigation.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880]   EU.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   There's a lot to do.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:24.960]   Or anything else anybody wants to to discuss before we get to our picks of the week.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.760]   I think that's all the, all the big stories.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:36.000]   Lexus LF concept car has headrest mounted iPhone docs.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.480]   I don't know.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480]   It's a concept.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480]   Stupid.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.320]   How am I going to drive and see the iPhone in the headphone dock?
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.320]   It's cool.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.320]   That's like an accident waiting to have.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.320]   See, now I got to turn around.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.320]   Get behind it.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.320]   Almost.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.320]   Yeah, ever.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.320]   I think this is kind of cool.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.600]   I wouldn't mind a seat that had a dock for an iPhone in it.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.520]   See, I want that on the dashboard.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.040]   That's where they won't do that.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.040]   Like, we know where my GPS is.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.480]   Where my GPS unit is, I can pull that out and put my iPhone in there and let it run Tom
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.160]   Tom or whatever and everything else that I have on my iPhone.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:10.080]   And you know, give me an SDK to my Honda so I can change the air fuel mix.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.080]   That's what I want.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:19.080]   You know, in Australia, you cannot use the GPS programs in the iPhone without a stand.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.800]   I built in, you know, you have to have.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.800]   It's pretty hard.
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.800]   No, I tried that in Dallas.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.800]   It was it was.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.800]   Putting it in the cars.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.800]   Everybody in the cars.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.240]   So which one have you decided yet which one you like the best?
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.640]   You were looking at Tom Tom.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.000]   I have both GMaps and Tom Tom.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.480]   I like GMaps.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.080]   The fit and finish of Tom Thomas.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.080]   Significant.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.080]   Significant.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.800]   GMaps has a new version out soon.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.960]   And Tom Tom was the only one that could find.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.960]   What was it?
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.760]   There was a there is a location that we go to.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.600]   Well, I have to say I use GMaps to get across town in San Francisco.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.600]   Uh huh.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.600]   Not good.
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.600]   As Tom Tom hits it.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.200]   You know, hits it on and there's a there's a location that we that we do that we drop
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200]   stuff off on.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:08.560]   I just can't think of it off the top of my head, but every single, um, uh, GPS is failed
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.960]   except for Tom Tom Tom Tom figured out where it was.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.480]   It's kind of one of those weird things where the address is one place and the buildings
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.680]   and another and Tom Tom figured it out.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.680]   Here's a story.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.120]   Actually, I'll throw this in from one of our, uh, chatters Norway.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.120]   Maybe he's from Norway.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.120]   I don't know.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.600]   I'm supposed to roll out three G. I'm sorry.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:33.040]   AT&T posed to roll out three G micro cell service.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:39.480]   So for $150, you can put five bars in a 5,000 square foot area.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.480]   I'm all over that.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.480]   Three G speed.
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.720]   I'm all over that.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.200]   I would do that in a heartbeat.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.200]   No monthly charge.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.000]   If you use existing minutes, you can add unlimited phone calls to the device for an extra $20
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   a month.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   So this is really for a business.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.400]   Oh, I'd put this in here and yeah.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.000]   Our office is like a, is like a Faraday cage.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.400]   We, you literally, you, you two feet from the windows and you can barely use it.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.800]   They are testing it in Charlotte, North Carolina right now.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.760]   So if anybody's listening in Charlotte and has tried the night microcell, I'd be very
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.240]   interested in this.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:13.400]   Now, how does it get its, how does it get back to the, the world connected to ethernet?
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.960]   Or we could put it right out.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   I think you put it out.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.960]   Oh, so it's a repeater.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.960]   Oh, I mean, not.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.120]   Let's see.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.120]   They make repeaters.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   So I think this one actually might.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120]   Connect to ethernet.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120]   So it would be kind of like, Oh, wait a minute.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.600]   Here's a little video with some fabulous music.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:31.120]   AT&T 3G microcell and proved our families where I was experienced and can do the same
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.640]   for you by clicking on one of these options.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.640]   I hate it.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.440]   What websites do this?
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.800]   She's now just sitting and looking at me on the sofa.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.400]   It's a very popular part to a 1970s.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.400]   So it's kind of burnt orange.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.560]   Yeah, that's a weird choice.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.560]   Well, it matches the AT&T orange.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.160]   Five bar coverage in your home.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:59.080]   Oh, yes, it connects to your existing broadband.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:02.080]   This is an interesting product with some fine music.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.440]   Let's see how fast that 3D J--
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.440]   What's up pumpkin?
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.440]   Oh, M.D.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:10.400]   I just sent a picture message on my new Jessica Kelsey who sent it to Amy who emailed it
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.680]   to Amber who was B.F.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.360]   That's what Brittany showed it to Beth's way hot brother Jason and he totally thinks
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   it's cute.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.000]   This family likes spurt orange.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   And a awful lot.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.320]   In addition to calls, your microcell likes you like to totally send and receive pictures.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.760]   Let's check the availability checker.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.800]   Unfortunately, the 3G microcell is not effort in your area.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.360]   I put it in San Francisco.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.360]   I'm aggressive.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.640]   I wouldn't worry about it.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.120]   It's not a big 3G town.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.120]   Well, that's actually the town where everybody complains.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.760]   Well, it's because everyone's got an eye.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.200]   I mean, everybody in their brother has an iPhone.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.160]   And I think that's the real problem is that they just put so much pressure on that network.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.800]   Sprint apparently does this as well.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.680]   So the idea is you essentially you're your own cell site.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.680]   I'd love that.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.840]   It's a great idea using your broadband.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.920]   I'd be super happy with that.
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.640]   And people say, well, there's one of the article in Gizmodo is saying, you know, why
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.040]   don't they just make a better service?
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.680]   Well, I think that there are people who like us who are offices just in a weird layout
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680]   that we've put for an office.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.680]   It's great for an office.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.440]   It's great for an office.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.800]   And it gives you kind of your own course in office.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.800]   We have Wi-Fi.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:21.080]   It's helping you get a phone call though.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.280]   Well, it sounds like you get phone calls on it too.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.040]   I know I'm saying that.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:29.920]   Verizon has it too.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.840]   Apple is investigating reports of poor battery life for the iPhone 3.1 update.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.960]   Now I have an I have my battery life's been OK.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:40.080]   I think as you guys noticed bad battery life.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.320]   I have.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.000]   I have you have.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.240]   But I don't notice it as much.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.760]   I just noticed that it seemed to go down more.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.600]   I have a mophion almost all the time.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.160]   So I don't maybe that's why I don't notice it.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.240]   I just plug it in all the time.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.240]   It's always plugged in.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.240]   I don't.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.240]   Yeah, I tell I wouldn't notice it.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.240]   Andy, you go out.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.880]   You go outside once in a while, right?
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.880]   See the world.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:00.240]   I think as you can see by my rich George Hamilton like complexion.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.440]   Yeah, I only had one incident actually that was unexplained.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.720]   So when I read this report, I thought maybe that explains it.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.640]   That one incident in which I had my had the iPhone next to my bed.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:15.400]   I don't normally charge overnight because I'll charge it like for an hour and a half,
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:19.520]   two hours when I'm driving around all day in my car for a few days a week.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.680]   And it was pretty much fully charged when I went to bed in the morning.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.040]   It was dead, dead, dead.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.800]   So I'm wondering if there wasn't something that maybe there's something going on that
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.280]   says, oh, I need to I've lost sight of my tower.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.880]   I need to start doing a very big broad spectrum scan for a new place to get my 3G signal from
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.640]   and that was causing the battery to die down.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640]   Yeah, that can happen.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.840]   That was only one time and maybe I just was so drunk that night that I forgot that.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.840]   You saw sorts of things.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.840]   I forgot something.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.280]   Wow, you actually have you go to like parties and stuff.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.320]   No, I heard of that.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.800]   I've heard of that.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.160]   The apparently what will happen is the Apple if you complain about it on the discussion
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.240]   boards or you're somehow identified by a genius is having this problem.
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:01.520]   They will send you a special battery life logging app that will log your battery life
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.520]   and then sync it to iTunes and send it back to an Apple for analysis.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.600]   So it's I guess they're acknowledging there's an issue.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:13.040]   I remember talking to a developer on the iPhone team at a Jonathan Colton concert and this
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.920]   was when two one wanted to come out and I thought really or maybe it was two one.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.240]   I thought really improved the battery life dramatically and I said, hey, thank you.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.240]   Right.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.600]   Apparently these firmware updates can really make a big difference in overall battery life.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.040]   Well, just how they're using the CPU.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.000]   Anyway, if you've if you've noticed this, you know, I have Google voice numbers for some
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   of the other shows.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.800]   Google Google voice number.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.400]   I requested when I haven't got another one.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.960]   I have several because I bought the money bay.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.440]   I should get to that.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.440]   Two bucks.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.440]   Really?
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   I can buy them on eBay.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.440]   Not anymore.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.080]   I don't know where the guys selling getting them with the selling, but it worked.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.400]   And so but I should warn you, you have to have a unique phone number for the landline number
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.280]   or cell number for each account.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.280]   That's fine.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.880]   And you have to create a Google Gmail for each account.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:05.160]   What we're looking at is changing our phone at the office to a Google voice.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.600]   And then have it reroute stuff.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.480]   You know, so and literally if we don't know who you are, we're going to route your phone
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.480]   to an answering service.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480]   Let them talk to you.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.880]   And because we want to we basically want to turn all the phones off in the office.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.880]   That's what I do.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.880]   In the office.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.080]   So, okay, I'll get us a number and what, wait a minute.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.280]   I have a number you can use.
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.600]   Because I'd like to open it up for a couple of things.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.840]   Folks at phone tag gave us a number we can use.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:42.360]   But I'd like you to call in if you have particularly had this battery issue or not.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:47.280]   So let me give you the number eight, seven, seven, twit eight, eight, one.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   Eight.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:52.120]   I don't, this doesn't ring the dains number or something.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.720]   Eight, seven, seven.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.480]   Oh, he's so sorry if it does.
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.440]   It should just get you should just get a you.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.800]   I haven't changed the answering message.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:04.200]   So you probably get a generic message, but then you can leave us a message and we will.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.840]   And then it sends us an email and transcription of it and and also the audio of it.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.920]   We'll play some of your responses on the show.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.080]   I'm starting to do this on the other shows.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.760]   I like getting user feedback, but in particular, I'd like to hear if you've had issues with
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:20.520]   your battery since you've upgraded to iPhone 3.1.1.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:26.960]   Eight, seven, seven, twit eight, eight, one.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.960]   That's the full number.
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.600]   And I think that's still free.
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.880]   That's better than a Google voice number.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:37.200]   Thank you to the folks at phone tag for giving us that phone tag school because it lets you
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.960]   have your voicemail, even if you have an Apple iPhone have your voicemail be sent to you
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:42.960]   via email.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.360]   It's, which is a great idea.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.360]   It's great.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.360]   All right.
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360]   Let's take a break.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.320]   When we come back, we're going to get your pics of the week kids.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.440]   But before we do that, it's time to talk about our friends at audible audible.com, the great
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.680]   source of audio entertainment books, lectures, newspapers.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.680]   You get the Wall Street Journal.
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.680]   You get the New York Times.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.520]   You get the New Yorker read to you.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:06.000]   I mean, what a great idea.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   How much time just think about it?
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.640]   How much time you spend where you you you you're not doing anything else, but you can't read.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.200]   I'm I'm one of those people.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.200]   In fact, who was it?
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.520]   I was talking to somebody about Daisy Whitney.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.880]   And I think it was Colleen.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.640]   She said, Daisy's a real reader.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:21.640]   I said, Oh, really?
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.640]   How do you know that?
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.000]   She said, anytime there's any town time she immediately picks up a book, right?
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.600]   Immediately pick that's how you get a lot of reading done.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:35.120]   Well, anytime I'm in the car at the gym, cleaning, washing dishes, cleaning a house,
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.280]   making dinner, you'll see me with my little earbuds in because I'm listening to an audible
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.280]   book.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.480]   That's how I get so much reading done, even though I don't have a commute anymore, I can
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   read it.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:48.240]   And hours a week done in those little moments when you just aren't doing anything else,
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.400]   but you can't hold a book in front of your nose.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   So I want you to join Audible.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.480]   You're going to get a this is the gold account.
[01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:58.080]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.520]   And the gold account is one book a month.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.720]   Your first one's free.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:05.200]   Even if you decide not to stick around, you get to keep that book forever.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:10.760]   Audible.com/macbreak Andy usually has a pretty good audible recommendation for us.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.560]   You have something Andy or should I?
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.440]   I do have something.
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.440]   Go ahead.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:20.000]   I was reading Roger Ebert's coverage of the Toronto Film Festival as usual.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.200]   Just great daily blogs with great movies and stories he's been hearing and stories
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.120]   has been investigating.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:32.000]   And probably the most worrying story out of Toronto Film Festival this year is that no
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.760]   films are selling.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:39.080]   It's a big marketplace for movies that haven't found distribution yet.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:43.320]   And that's usually the start of Oscar season often begins at the Toronto Film Festival
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.600]   where someone pays $6 million, $7 million, $8 million for a really good art house film
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:52.440]   that then gets massive distribution and comes to everyone's attention.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:57.640]   And we first heard about this a few days ago when the producers of a biography of Charles
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:00.960]   Darwin of course didn't fail to sell his films.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:04.400]   Oh, that's how bad the religious stuff is.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.040]   And the evolution debate is the United States there.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:10.960]   They fear a movie about the revolution and then turns out that well, no, no movies are
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:11.960]   selling.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.960]   Ebert is reporting that only one movie has sold for a very, very low price.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   Wow.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.800]   Really, really worried about the future of like what the next season is going to be like
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.200]   in terms of really good small movies.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.200]   Why do you think it is?
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.400]   Because there's just no market for it.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:31.000]   There's, yeah, there's no money and it's not a point that the movies that tend to get
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:38.160]   offered at Toronto tend not to have really easy marketing hooks, not always, but often
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.000]   don't have stars named with them.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.400]   Although Robert Duvall is a star of one of these movies that did not sell.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.160]   That sounded really interesting.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:50.280]   So people just to think that nobody wants to see an indie movie, they want to see the
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.280]   big blockbusters.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.960]   Definitely go to like Roger Ebert.com and read this article.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:59.720]   It's indie security or alert level severe.
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:03.840]   And as usual, it's also, it's also filled with it as usually does such a great job with
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:08.200]   it because it also includes trailers to just about all these movies that he's discussing
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:13.240]   to have not sold at our at best headed for like the stars network if you get to see them
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.560]   at all.
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:19.200]   And so that's the, the, it really put me in mind of the difference between movie industry
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:24.800]   right now and the way it was back in the 70s when, sorry, it's okay.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:31.040]   No tension that sound.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.040]   Like you open a window.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.880]   There's like a press button nearby and you slam just shut it down.
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.040]   It's exactly what it is.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.040]   And I'll show you after you do your pick why I'm, what that is all about.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.800]   Well, I'll show you that.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.280]   This is, this is, this is, you could finish your finish, but this is somebody sent me
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.280]   this movie and said, this is why you need audible.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:53.120]   This is, this is a guy driving down the highway reading the book.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.120]   I saw that.
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:57.520]   I saw that coming at 70 miles an hour.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.960]   Can you believe that?
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.400]   It's reading a novel.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.560]   While he's driving.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.560]   Not a map.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.760]   It's a novel.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.960]   So, so this is why you need audible.com.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:14.080]   This is, this is, this is why I do not, don't be that guy.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.400]   I saw someone I was sitting in the bus.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:19.120]   I was sitting in the bus coming up to Petaluma and saw someone, you're looking down.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.800]   I saw someone sitting there reading a book.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.800]   They put it in their lap.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.160]   This guy has it on the steering wheel.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:24.160]   No, she had it on the steering wheel.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.280]   She was sitting there reading it and I was just like, I'm really glad I'm in the bus
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.840]   because it probably won't hurt me.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.800]   Well, here's, it could get it even worse.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.200]   Here's a bus driver reading while driving in a snowstorm.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.600]   He's your own driver.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.600]   He's your own YouTube.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.600]   Look at this.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.600]   Look at this.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.600]   Do not do this.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.600]   Okay.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.600]   Get audible kids.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:46.720]   It's, it's, it's a good thing that I'm not like hugely wealthy because I'd be like screw
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.720]   it.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:50.040]   I'm going to, I'm going to collide with this guy just so he can, when the officer says,
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.720]   what were you doing at the time of the collision, sir?
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.200]   He will have to say, I was reading a book.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.560]   Oh, you know, you know, my father's a lawyer.
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:00.800]   And when there's whenever there's a car accident and when client comes in with a car accident,
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.200]   the first thing he does is subpoena the phone records.
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.040]   You know, because he said if, if, if you're on the phone during an accident, it doesn't
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.680]   matter whether it's your fault or not, game over.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:12.480]   I was re-ending it a couple of years ago and the guy got out of the car and said, I'm
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.720]   sorry, I was on the phone.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.480]   He like admitted it.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.120]   Pay attention, folks.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.840]   Don't, but audible's great this way.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.840]   So sorry, Andy, I didn't mean to.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:25.640]   Anyway, I, I, I, it made me think of a great book that I read a number of years ago when
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:31.440]   it first came out as, as actual tree where it's called Easy Riders Raging Bulls, How the
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.360]   Sex Drugs Rock and Roll Generation Saved Hollywood.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:39.800]   And it is one of the best movies about Hollywood and movie making ever written.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.680]   It is all about the era in the late 60s and early to mid 70s when it seems as though the
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.680]   grittier, the more realistic, the more out there that a director was, he could have,
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.040]   it was a time when you could have great success.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:57.280]   If you had actors who are definitely not in any sort of mold existed up to that time,
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:02.120]   they could be, they could just get job after job after job racking up incredible performance
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.680]   after incredible performance after incredible performance.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:10.760]   I mean, this is the era of De Niro, Pacino, Jack Nicholson, that of, there's a time when
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.920]   George Lucas was not known for Star Wars.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.720]   There's a time when he was known as being this very, very intensely, intensely hard
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.000]   working maker of extremely experimental features.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.760]   And this, this not only documents that entire time, but it's unusual in that the, the author
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.840]   Peter Biskin, he got interviews with just about everywhere.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.640]   And I'm, I'm including George Lucas.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:34.640]   I'm including Spielberg.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:35.880]   I'm including Coppola.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.920]   I think he might have gotten a Scorsese as well.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:45.000]   So it's one of the few places where you can get these firsthand accounts of one of the
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.240]   most exciting times in the hundred years of cinema.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.160]   Awesome.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:54.720]   Easy riders, raging bulls and sex and we're, we're, we're artistic people.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:58.440]   So we're not supposed to care about these things, but for your free book, 23 hours,
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.080]   41 minutes, baby, sticking it to the man on a bridge.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:04.160]   You get a lot for very little.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.800]   Don't go for those 43 minute fresh air interviews.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.440]   They're great, but that's not, we should be spending your one free credit on.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.440]   Go for the unabridged.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.440]   Awesome.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.440]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:19.360]   Your first one is free boys and girls.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.360]   Great pick.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.880]   In fact, I'm, let me add that to my car right now.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.440]   This is the one thing I don't like about you, Andy.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.360]   Every time you recommend a book and that's four times a month, I've got to add it.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.360]   Oh, man.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.680]   I wailed my, my next recommendation, the one that I'm going through right now is like,
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:41.600]   Oh man, I wish I could, I know I use one of my free credits on this, but I need to go
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:47.760]   give them more money for this one because it's more like, I think, I think if Tom, Tom
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.640]   really wants to sell like, sell these things, they should get a deal with Audible that says,
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.040]   find out what track I'm listening to right now.
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.480]   Please find me a route that will get, that will get me on the road until this channel.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.480]   No kidding.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.480]   No kidding.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.480]   That's the sort of book I'm listening to right now.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.480]   Oh, there's so many great books.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.680]   I'm just finishing up Game of Thrones.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.920]   And before I go to the next one, because there's five volumes, I'm going to put another book
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.520]   or two in there, but I just bought that easy writer's raging bowls.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.600]   That sounds, I love film and I love that era.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.400]   That was a great era in film.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.400]   Let's get our picks of the week.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.080]   I'm going to let you start, Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.320]   So, so I've been in the past.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.920]   I've been doing a lot of iPhone apps.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:28.480]   I thought I'd come back and come back to us.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.560]   Come back to us.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:35.440]   So there's a new version of Cinema 40 and it just got released a couple weeks ago.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:42.000]   And Cinema 40 is the kind of our go to application to do a lot of the graphics that we do for
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.520]   a lot of the 3D graphics.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:48.760]   And it is just a, my recommendation is really based on if you want to get something done
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.680]   quickly, we use a lot of 3D applications.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:57.640]   But the one that we train people on to get started is Cinema 40 because we know that
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.720]   we can get them up to speed quickly.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:04.880]   We know that they'll be able to do broadcast quality work in weeks rather than months or
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.800]   years.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.080]   You can really get something pretty looking very, very fast.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.080]   And it renders quickly.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:16.720]   One of the great things about it is that it takes advantage of every ounce of your computer,
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.320]   which is not good when you're trying to run it in the background.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.600]   Like great when you're trying to get work done.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.360]   You turn it on and it uses, if you have eight cores, it's going to use all of them.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.120]   You know, it's going to suck those all up.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:30.040]   It's going to suck up every ounce of RAM at 64-bit aware.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.560]   They have a new rendering engine they just built.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.800]   It's got some great new dynamics.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:38.120]   And so it's just, if you're thinking about 3D, you should definitely download the demo.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.200]   They have a 30-day full of the operational demo.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.200]   And if you're thinking about getting into it, I just can't recommend it more.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.400]   When it comes to an all-around, we use a lot of specialty 3D apps for different kinds
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.400]   of things.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.880]   But as an all-around, I just want to get into 3D.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.200]   I want to play with this.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.080]   But I want a professional level one that's really used.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.440]   This is the most popular one when it comes to broadcast graphics.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.880]   And the user interface is okay.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.040]   It's pretty easy to use.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.280]   I mean, that's the problem I have.
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:04.160]   Like I would recommend Blender, for instance, which is free.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.160]   Except the interfaces.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.160]   Who can use it?
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.720]   You know, I think that I find that the interface is, you know, any 3D interface is going to
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.360]   be, you just take a little bit of work.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:17.360]   But of all the applications that we've had to train people on, this one we've found that
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:24.480]   they, it covers the area where it's both easy to learn and it's also scalable and powerful.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.480]   There are applications that are--
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.480]   There are applications that are--
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:28.080]   And your skills will apply to other--
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:30.840]   Yeah, once you learn this, you can move on to other things if you want to.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:31.840]   That's another problem with Blender.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:32.840]   You learn Blender.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:33.840]   And then you know Blender.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.840]   You know Blender.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:35.840]   Yeah, a lot of the concepts will move on.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.400]   Obviously, every application's going to have a different approach to everything.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:43.440]   But you know, there are apps that do things that are big, better for big houses.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:49.200]   If you're using, you might want to use Softamaj or Maya for heavy film work that requires
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.800]   lots of custom code.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.160]   You might want to use 3D Studio, for instance, for game development.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.680]   Because there's a lot of specialty code.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:59.360]   But when it comes to an all around application that gets the stuff done and gets it done and
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.920]   does everything, you know, we use Moto, for instance, to do a lot of our modeling.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:06.160]   But if we want to do all the animation, if we want to have all--
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.800]   You know, all the pieces are in one place.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.360]   So you need to get the Studio Bundle to get that or--
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.360]   Because that's only--
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.200]   That's a little expensive.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.200]   It is a little--
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.200]   That's five Alex's.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.280]   The five Alex's?
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.800]   For the Studio Bundle.
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800]   No, no, you don't need the Studio Bundle.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.280]   You just need the regular base.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.280]   That's only a problem with the base.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.280]   I would start with the base.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:25.800]   The average person getting into it doesn't need more than the base to get started.
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.800]   And then you can decide--
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.800]   So you get 740 cores 1,000.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.560]   And then you can start adding onto it.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.560]   There's different--
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.200]   The Studio Bundle has, I guess, everything.
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.640]   But there's also a broadcast edition.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:37.360]   There's an architectural edition.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.360]   That's kind of cool.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.080]   So you could get it for what you were--
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:43.040]   And that's where-- and the reason there's a broadcast in an architectural one specifically
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.280]   is because those are huge markets for this product.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:50.880]   If you're doing broadcast graphics or architectural visualization, it does-- it happens to render
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.000]   really, really quickly.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.840]   And it's very fast to move forward.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.880]   The broadcast edition goes right into After Effects.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.920]   Motion, final cut, shake.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.160]   Well, and that's the thing.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.920]   A lot of us-- there's a lot of things that people like me have made requests of over
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:03.920]   the years.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.240]   And I think that's one of the reasons we use it is because it renders all these extra
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.720]   passes and everything else to either motion or After Effects.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:15.120]   They've gotten really good at their integration with 2D applications that we might want to
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:18.440]   use, whether it's motion or After Effects.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:25.480]   And it's just as an all-around application, it's a great place to-- and it's worth downloading
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.200]   the demo no matter what.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:33.040]   Download the demo, play with it, and there's some starter videos.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.280]   But this is what we train.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:38.120]   This is what we start PIXQL members on when we're training them.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.120]   That's pretty high.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.120]   That tells you this is it.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.120]   This is what we--
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.120]   This is the one.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.040]   And as I said, we probably use six different 3D apps for different things that we do.
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:51.120]   But the core of like, I just want an all-around app that's easy to learn that can get-- make
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.160]   really good looking stuff quickly.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.160]   This is cinema.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:00.880]   Andy Inako, Mr. Naco, your pick of the week this week.
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:04.760]   Oh, my pick is the exciting world of luggage.
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:05.760]   Luggage.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.760]   We love luggage.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:08.440]   Actually, you know, I have a luggage fetish.
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.440]   I like luggage.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.440]   I like watches.
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.440]   I like pens.
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:16.000]   Those are objects of fetish objects really.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.800]   And they're useful things for people who travel.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:23.680]   I ran into a problem in that one by one over the previous about 14 months, every single
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:29.160]   important piece of travel, like geek travel stuff that I had just fell apart or destroyed
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.640]   or just was beyond reclamation.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:38.000]   And so I took me like four or five months to find a replacement for the bag that I take
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.800]   when I'm just going for two or three days.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:45.920]   Not the one that I take when I have just-- I just need to change underwear and toothbrush
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:50.120]   not the big bag that I take to go to China and or do a trade show for an entire week.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.440]   I just need the thing that I need to have a suit jacket.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:56.200]   I need to have a couple of days worth of stuff and I need to be well protected.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:02.400]   And the bag that I wound up going with is actually a public in case.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.400]   Those really indestructible--
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.040]   Have some in my head case.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.200]   Bulletproof cases.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:12.200]   I was actually originally shopping for the big week-long case.
[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.280]   I thought, gee, you know what I should do?
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.880]   I should just get this thing as almost like a steamer trunk.
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:20.240]   I'll know that everything I put in there will be incredibly well protected.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:22.720]   That particular case is designed to be checked baggage.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.040]   That thing that I was originally looking at, I decided not to-- I decided to go elsewhere
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:31.080]   when I realized that this is a 20-pound case and the baggage allowance is 50 pounds.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.080]   Don't forget about that.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.080]   The case itself.
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:34.080]   It's funny.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:40.560]   It can drop it off of an aircraft carrier into water and it will still protect your stuff.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:43.360]   You can't photographers use these, videographers use them.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.120]   We have the toughest stuff out there.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.800]   We have small pelican cases that are small that hold compact flashes all the way up to
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.640]   the giant ones that we put our Mac Pros in.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:52.640]   We use a pelican.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:57.960]   We have a pelican rack that we've never used, but if we ever have to bring the tricaster
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:33:59.280]   on the road, that goes in the pelican rack.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.280]   So which one did you get?
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.960]   The one I got-- this is for the two or three-day trips.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:07.360]   This is the 1510 LOC, which is their standard 1510 case.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.320]   LOC means that they've upholstered the inside of it to hold your laptop, your cables, and
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:16.360]   fit it out into the interior of it so that you can pack your clothes in there and they
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.520]   won't get all dusty and messed up with.
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.200]   It's exactly big enough for about two or three days.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:25.640]   I don't think it's large enough to really handle the whole weeks for the travel.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   I can get my jacket in there pretty nicely.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.440]   It's a good compromise.
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:36.720]   It does have the one feature that really-- I'm sorry, two real big features on it.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.760]   One which has always been a concern of mine.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.920]   Whenever I travel and I try to-- I usually check at least one bag because it's just more
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:45.920]   convenient.
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:49.480]   Sometimes though when I fly, I will just take one bag for the overhead, but then you wind
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:55.120]   up with these idiots who like-- I once I actually got literally shoved aside because
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:57.360]   I was about to put my bag in an open space in the overhead.
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.800]   Someone shoved me aside literally so they can get his laptop bag in there and take the
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:05.680]   last available space and to avoid an incident that would be involved in air marshals, I
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.680]   simply had to take it.
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:09.360]   What I think I'm worried about though is that when I travel that way, I'll have valuable
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.320]   things in my carry-on.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:15.000]   If they're out of overhead space and you have to check a bag, I'm not going to check
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.760]   like a soft-sided backpack in through baggage hand.
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:22.560]   Baggage control, what I have maybe a camcorder or some other cool stuff in there.
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:27.200]   The cool thing about this case is that if you do wind up in that sort of problem, you
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.320]   know that at least things will be well protected.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:30.320]   It's not the optimal thing.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:34.200]   I still don't like putting valuables into inside check baggage, but at least I'll know
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.600]   it will be very well protected.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:42.000]   It'll also be very well protected when it's being handled by the baggage handlers at the
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.880]   hotel, at the concierge desk, all that sort of stuff.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.720]   The other really good thing I like about it is that we've also been in these situations
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:55.000]   where there's bad weather, flights are being canceled left and right, there's no place
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000]   to sit.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.040]   Well, it's strong enough that you can actually have a place to sit.
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.040]   Okay.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.000]   When you're actually working, you'll actually have a little table, like a nice strong table.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.320]   You can actually put your laptop on top of.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320]   It's a multi-purpose thing.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:09.760]   Again, I like the fact that it could be used as a bludgeon, as a bulletproof weapon in case
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.960]   that there's a Chuck Norris sort of situation at the airport.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:16.720]   Again, given that it is going to be a piece of carry-on luggage, you don't really have
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.560]   to care about the weight, you may as well get the extra protection.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:23.120]   So if I were ever, I know that I'm well protected.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.960]   If I ever were in a situation where I'm going to be taking a couple different camera bodies
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:29.200]   with me or a couple of things that I don't necessarily want to throw in.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.920]   So I'm looking at this studio cruiser one that has, you could put a 15-inch laptop in and
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:38.320]   in the top and then your lenses and your camera in the bottom.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:39.320]   That looks like a good...
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.960]   See, I love the way the company works and that they'll design these really strong cases
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:47.320]   and then they will, again, come out with different ways of kitting up the inside to make one
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.080]   of them a perfect way to carry a photo gear, another one a good way to be a two-seeker
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:52.080]   suitcase.
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:57.480]   And you do feel like, Mr. Toughguy, when you're rolling down the jetway in one of these bad
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:01.520]   boys, that's not one of the travel-proof things you got at the dollar store.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.000]   Andy, you're doing it to me again.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.240]   I'm going to put this now.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.120]   There's a couple companies that specialize in customizing these.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.520]   So you can get one that you can put your Mac Pro and your 30-inch monitor and it all
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.120]   goes into one big one.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:16.600]   We have ones that are built specifically for our EX ones and other ones that are built
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:22.320]   specifically for our EX3 that has all the battery, whatever.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:26.080]   We have one for just about everything we have to carry around that's small.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.800]   We bought those hard dig cases, which are the Pelican cases, the racks, and those are
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.840]   just amazing.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.040]   I think we bought them used because they were so expensive.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.240]   This is not a cheap case.
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:37.400]   It's a $285.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.760]   It looks like, yeah.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.440]   You get online for $220, but yeah, this is--
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.440]   $120, okay.
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.960]   You get given that another high end cases like that would cost you $120, you aren't paying
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:47.960]   a premium.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.640]   But this is also another problem is that realized that I'm replacing just about every bag that
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.400]   I ever travel with at once.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.640]   And I'm looking at, okay, there are no zipper pulls on any of these.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.080]   There are broken zippers on all of them.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.560]   There's only one hand left on this bag.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:05.240]   You know that this one, you're going to get sick and tired of it before this thing is
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.240]   going to fall apart on it.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.240]   This is designed to take any kind of abuse.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:09.480]   Actually, I'm looking on Amazon.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:13.840]   You can get it without any phone for $123.
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:14.840]   So if you--
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.960]   And then buy a separate pad, they'll sell these patterns.
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:20.920]   If you can find one that's customized for what you need, it's always better than pick
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.920]   and pluck.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.000]   So you get the pick and pluck and it ends up ending up with small debris in everything.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.760]   It scratches off and everything else.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.920]   We used to use pick and pluck and then we moved on.
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:32.480]   Just to get it more permanent you want.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.280]   It's nice in that it keeps everything organized.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:39.360]   The lid of this case is automatic, is already recessed by an inch and a half or two inches.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.840]   And they give you a custom bean and chintope bag, another custom pouch that attach to the
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:47.120]   inside of that lid for all your cables and stuff.
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.640]   And the bottom half is designed for your clothes, your toiletries and stuff like that.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:56.600]   It's not going to just have a random chest where things are just rattling around randomly.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:59.160]   Well I think I'm going to a Dubai in a week and a half.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.720]   I think I need something to look like my cameras.
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.720]   Stand up to a sandstorm, very nice.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:10.040]   The only time we don't use these is when it's actually the two times that we don't use them
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:12.880]   is one is we're going to be walking around a lot and we want to have a backpack which
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.600]   is when we use katas.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:18.200]   And the other time is when we go into some countries where we don't want a lot of attention
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:21.520]   because the one thing the Pelican is very business like, I mean business like from a
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:26.040]   photographer's point of view, it's really hard to say that you're here for vacation
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.040]   with the Pelican case.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:28.040]   So that's the other.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:29.040]   Good point.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.440]   Those are the two times we don't.
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.560]   In Africa, Pelican case means that it will be searched.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:39.680]   I mean you know it's not a, they know that there's something valuable in there.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.680]   They're not, you know, which is why you get it.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:45.560]   So it's, and we still use them a lot.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.560]   Right.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.560]   All right.
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.160]   I'm pushing the order button right now.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.160]   There you go.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.320]   Time for my pick.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.000]   And I actually owe somebody in the chat room and I'm not sure it was at J5.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:01.520]   Algren, I think it was for this website, a website, but this is kind of a website that's
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:07.080]   the ultimate in Mac picks because on this website, you can find alternatives to all
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.320]   the Mac software you're looking for.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.720]   It's called alternative to.net.
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:19.440]   Al T-E-R-N-A-T-I-V-E-T-O.net actually it's for Windows and Linux as well, but they list
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.840]   popular programs.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:24.960]   So let's go to Adobe Photoshop and then list in a dig style.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.680]   So people are voting on it.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.280]   What other choices there are out there?
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:36.800]   The GIMP, 268 likes pixel meter, 36 likes Adobe fireworks, GIMP shop, Adobe Photoshop
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.120]   elements, so you can go through this and look for alternatives if you don't want to buy
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:46.720]   Photoshop or you're looking for an alternative that will do kind of the same thing.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:48.240]   Here's drop box, which we've talked about.
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:51.000]   I think that was one of our picks in fact recently.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.720]   There's some other choices.
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.720]   That's great.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.720]   Isn't that great?
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:00.880]   And because people are voting on it, you can rank it by popularity or by most views, most
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:06.320]   likes or people are adding the alternatives to it.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:11.560]   And I really want to encourage people to use this because the more people use it and add
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:14.720]   alternatives to it, the better the database is going to be.
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.160]   It's a really great site, absolutely free.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.680]   There's a mobile version as well.
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:22.200]   It will work on your iPhone and they even have mobile applications.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.560]   So you can look at iPhone alternatives.
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:30.040]   So if you, for instance, say, well, I was looking at IM+ for chatting.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.320]   What else is out there for the iPhone?
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:37.840]   It'll give you a list of other chatting like Beehive clients that you could use.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:44.560]   So iPhone, Windows Mobile, Android, BlackBerry, Asymbian, also Macintosh, also Windows.
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.760]   I mean, this is a really neat idea for a site.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:54.360]   Alternative2.net will help you find the programs you're looking for.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.360]   You saw it the program.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.720]   You had to do that.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:01.920]   Really, really nice little site.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.520]   Thank you, J5, for recommending it to us.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.640]   Norway saying AJ case is another good place to look for Pelican style cases.
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:12.560]   Take a look at that.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.560]   AJ cases.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.640]   Andy, you're not going to go.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   You the guy.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.120]   Thank you so much for being here today and talking the talk and walking the walk.
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.960]   And to you too.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.880]   Happy talk like a private day.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:27.400]   I got you, sir.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:33.200]   You'll find Andy on the Chicago Sun Times where he reviews software and hardware.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.440]   And you'll also find his great books.
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.960]   The iPod fully loaded.
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.120]   iPhone fully loaded.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.240]   Third edition will be finished this week.
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.240]   And so it should be available.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:44.400]   It's available for pre-order on Amazon right now.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:45.400]   Oh, neat.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:46.400]   Yep.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:50.960]   So I'm basically hip-deep on redoing iTunes 9 screenshots.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:58.440]   It's that horrible part of the project where it's like, I've just found out about this
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.880]   great piece of software two days ago.
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:03.680]   It's much better than the software I wrote about two months ago.
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:07.720]   Am I really going to throw out that whole section of the chapter just to read?
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.520]   I really am going to throw up that entire section.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:14.320]   Darn this commitment to high quality books.
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.280]   It's this burden.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.480]   The fact that I'm only thinking about providing the best value to my readers page for page,
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:24.040]   it's quite burdens sometimes.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.760]   Also his website, C-W-O-B dot com.
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:29.320]   The celestial waste of bandwidth.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.640]   Alex Lindsay, thanks for being here.
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:36.760]   Alex is of the Mayter D at the beautiful Pixel Core studios, pixacore dot com.
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:39.560]   We're going to be serving up some really interesting things in October.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.560]   So stay tuned.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:42.560]   Good.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:43.560]   Playing around with some changes to our membership.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:44.560]   Oh my God.
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.560]   You should make a lot of people excited.
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:46.560]   So check it out.
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.560]   That's at pixelcore.com.
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:48.560]   Dot com.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:53.640]   And of course we've got tons of Mac breaks, Mac break devs and everything else.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.840]   And we've really started to branch out.
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:56.080]   The Mac break devs are pretty geeky.
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.680]   So if you're into coding, they're excellent.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:59.320]   We're not pulling any punches.
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.880]   Very good.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:01.880]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:02.880]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.080]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.080]   We really appreciate it.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.600]   But you better get back to work because time is over.
