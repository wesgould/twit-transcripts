[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And we have assembled the Fearsome Foresome today. Let me tell you, it took some work to get them all on the same screen.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   But there they are, Renee Ritchie in your upper left-hand corner from iemore.com and the Vector Podcast, hi Renee.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Hi Lea, I went shopping today, they made me wash my hands for two minutes before I went in.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Really?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Sanitize them to grab the cart, sanitize them to use the payment method to pack this. Yeah, it was a whole procedure, but I was happy.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Oh, I'm glad they did that. I wish we would do that here. That's awesome.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   It was fantastic.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Andy Enaco, he's joining us from the center square to block.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I was going to use that joke because I'd like to go with Renee Ritchie for the win.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Andy from WGBH Boston, joining us from the hot zone of the East Coast.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   No, we are like one of the few remaining non-hot zones that I talked to my best friend in New York City, where it's like lock, lock, super lockdown.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And our governor has decided that maybe we should shut our, just like Canada, maybe we should shut our borders just to defend like vermin,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   from other New England states, from coming in and taking advantage of our non-infectionist.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I wish you would because my mom's in Rhode Island too, and I would like it for her to be safe. She's 87 years old and I am deeply worried about her and my dad, both 87.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yeah, and of course Sacramento is a pretty safe place, right, Lori Gill?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Because we're all locked down.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Yeah, locked down in her.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   These guys are always in their home. What's the big deal?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   We were always in the safe.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I'm tired of people telling me that because my mental health has always been based on the idea of I get to stay inside as long as I want, but I can still like walk down the street and have an afternoon to coffee show up and observe humanity.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Even if you never did that, the knowledge that you could make one day, we could leave one day, some day.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And there he is. Alex Lindsay, of course, with the best shot known to man, the best studio on the West Coast also in his home. Hi, Alex.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Hello. Hello. Good to have you.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I'm roughing it here with my family.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Are you probably busier than ever though, right?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It's on I know media because there's everybody's streaming all of a sudden.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It's hectic.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   You know, I don't know. People are still trying to figure it out.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So right now I'm having a lot of phone calls.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   We'll see what people do, but it's very, very busy right now because everyone's trying to take their whatever they were doing in person.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   They're trying to figure out how to put it online.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And the rules are changing about what you can and can't do.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   We had a last week we were we did a Patreon event.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Their weird telethon, which is what they called it.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And it started off as something we're going to do in their office.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And then on Monday we had to change it to zoom and it came out really well, but it was a lot of that.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You're using zoom? I'm surprised.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I thought you'd probably have some super secret method for doing that.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   So we have a more a bigger method that we had been building up, but we were like, oh, we'll have it ready sometime this summer.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   We'll be testing it, putting it out there.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   You know, it wasn't something that we necessarily needed.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   We got plenty of time.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And now so now we're working on it every day to get it built all up, you know, and it's, you know, it's a lot of the stuff that.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That twit does already.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It just has a little bit a couple more tools for communication so that you can talk between the crew and talk between the individuals and just some a lot of extra bits and pieces.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   But no studio.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So it doesn't it's not designed to have any anybody in the studio.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It's just designed to talk to people remotely.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So we're doing if you're watching the show on video, you probably if you're audio, you don't think you'll notice the difference.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   But if you're watching a video, you notice we're not using the round table.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I'm switching the show as I used to way back in the old days of the cottage.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Which is really hard.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Like I just want to point out as someone who's done it with Leo.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   You know, when I first when I was first handed, you know, the reins to run, I think this week in media, I think I did there in the twit cottage.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And it was very overwhelming.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Leo makes it look there's a lot to do.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I got like an octopus here doing this.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   But but it's funny because it comes back to you. I haven't done it in a long time.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   One of the things we did was when we built the the brick house and then subsequently this studio, the last past studio, we made sure that I could sit back and enjoy the show and have a technical director.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   But we decided in these difficult times that it would be better to have as few people in studio in the office as possible.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   So I'm in my office, which is locked sealed.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Only I use it.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   So I feel like I'm fairly safe here.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I'm probably safer here than home.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   There's nobody in this office.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And then we do have one engineer, John is a Gemmabes in the other studio studio A because somebody has to.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   He's not switching.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Normally we'd have a technical director, Carson or or Kevin or somebody be switching for us, but I'm doing the switching.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So that sent somebody home, Carson's at home, producing the show from his home.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   John has to be here just to do some there's some physical stuff that has to be done.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And that's about it.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I think our office manager Debbie's here, but she's all alone in her office.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   There's no one else there.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   We moved Lisa home last night, took all of her gear, including the most important thing, the check scanner.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We took.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   She was nervous.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And I was going to work when we get home.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I said, I'm sure we can get it to work.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Which wasn't easy because in the previous version we had only worked with, I think, Internet Explorer or something.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It was a very, you know, it's a bank, right?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It doesn't going to work with everything.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   But I think they're a little bit more flexible.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   But I am able to switch here.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   As I still switch a little bit for the radio show, I think it's the only show I do on my own in here.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   But now we'll do everything this way.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Why have somebody come in if we can keep them at home?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So forgive the awkward switching.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Although I am glad we were able to develop a quad box.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It's not quite the Octobox you might see on the news channels, but it's pretty good.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It's the Brady bunch box.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So I hear there's new hardware.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   We were talking about this last week.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   We stopped tickling each other.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   No, no, I just don't know if these people...
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   He's bad kitty and we're going to go.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   He's sanitizing her hair.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I don't know. We've talked last week.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   We've speculated Gee will Apple release new hardware.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Their stores are closed.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's kind of not a good time.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   On the other hand, it may be a chance to get a little extra revenue.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Well, they proved us... I don't know if we were right or wrong, but they proved us something by releasing the new iPad Pros 11 and 12.9 inch.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Oh, look, somebody's got one or two.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Was that the MacBook Air you got there?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Is that so gold?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Oh.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   So they announced a new MacBook Air and a new iPad Pro 11 and 12.9 inch.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   They announced for May this new Magic keyboard will have to wait.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   You don't have one of those, do you, Renee?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   No, I got the new folio.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   They don't have the new Magic keyboards already quite yet.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Yeah, to me, that's exciting.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   So why don't Renee, since you've had it for a few days...
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Almost a week.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It took a little while to get to Canada, because you might have had it.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   What does this say?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Tell us about it.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Tell us about both of them.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   What do you think?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Which one do you want to start with?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Well, start with the iPad.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Okay.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So it is very, very, very similar to the 2018 iPad Pro.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It's only got a few differences.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   The major one is this little box up here which looks at first blush like an iPhone 11 camera.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It's not quite as good.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Because the cameras aren't quite as big.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   The sensors aren't quite as big.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   It's got a wide angle and an ultra wide angle.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And then over here it has got coordination issues.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.080]   Over here it's got LiDAR, which is basically, think about it like a true depth camera but
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.080]   on the back.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.000]   So it can shoot out up to five meters and then measure time of flight back.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And that means if you're familiar with ARKit, it's like that but it's instant.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   It's like you don't have to move it around and try to scan the floor.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   It's just you want the Ikea chair there.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   You want to mesh of the entire room.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Here's your mesh of the room.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   You want physics based gravity.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   There you go.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   So it's just it's all of that stuff just amped up and powering it is an A12Z processor.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Not an A13X and A12Z.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Now, which is you, I preview, you struggle to say that Z.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I've been saying Z and you say Z.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I would say Z but then people like want to know where I'm from and why am I doing that
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   to them.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I like Z.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   We're going to call it the Z.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So how much faster is the A12Z by on it?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   So it's not faster really.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   What it is is it adds an 8 GPU core so it's wider.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   It's not necessarily faster but it's wider.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   It does have a tweaked performance controller which has always been Apple's secret sauce.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   It's not just that their chips are fast.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It's that they rapidly dispatch between the CPUs, the GPUs, the accelerator units and the
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   neural network and that helps make sure that the right task is being done and they're
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   being done.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   They don't have to wait for each other.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   They're not sort of getting each other's way.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   That's sort of the extent of it.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   There's a rumor that all of them have 6GB of RAM now.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I only have the one terabyte version which has always had 6GB so I can't confirm or
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   deny that part of it.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   But that's essentially the same screen, same Apple, Pencil, same speakers.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   The microphones are better.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Apple says they're like the 16 inch MacBook Pro microphones now.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   They're calling them studio quality.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   If you're on the road and you want to record an interview and you don't have a mic, you
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   can use those.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   It's essentially, it's not meant, people are panicking going, that's not a really big
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   upgrade from 2018.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   It's not really meant to be.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It's meant to be for people who haven't bought an iPad in a while and want to get the
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   latest and the greatest and not something that's 18 months old.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   But I think primarily it's meant to set up the next iPhone so that developers and everybody
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   have their hands on this LIDAR gear.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Then when the new iPhone comes out, there's a bunch of apps that are already done.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Apple gave us, they didn't put it up on their website for some reason, but they gave a bunch
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   of us a video of some developers showing it off and it's doing amazing things.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   My guess is when the new iPhone hits, it'll have all of that plus whatever Apple has been
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   working on like a new camera app, a new Mac app and the iPads will get all that as well.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   So, none of that is as important in my opinion as what they did with iOS 13.4 and the new
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   keyboard.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   So, I'm sorry, of course, let's hold that though because you were saying something, Alex?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Oh, I was always going to say is that the studio mic thing, regardless of the studio
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   mic, as we know, the placement of the mics and so having the mics on the iPad doesn't
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   necessarily make a studio quality process there.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   So, I think that the mics are kind of a little bit of overblown from that perspective.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   It's better though, isn't it to have those array mics than a single point mic?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   But it's still, I'm not convinced it's going to be something you'd want to use for production.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   But the LiDAR is a must have for a lot of us.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Is this fair to call it LiDAR?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Stacey Higginbotham said we should call it time of just a time of flight sensor.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   But it is technically a laser.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   I think it's the light hour is a kind of time of flight.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   But the other time of flight is LiDAR is my understanding.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And this is laser.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It is laser.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I'm a flight.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Okay.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   So, I know I do believe technically it's LiDAR.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I think that the interesting thing there is that one of the things that we spend a lot
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   of time when we're acquiring information about scenes or objects is mixing laser data with
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   photography so we can have photogrammetry filling in details and the laser data giving us
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   structure.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   So, what we call structured light versus an unstructured light.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   And so, the two of them working together is very interesting.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And I don't think we're going to see it immediately as the iPad comes out.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   But I think what we're going to start seeing are applications where it uses the LiDAR to
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   get very accurate information.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And then it uses the photos to fill in all the data, you know, in the texture and the lighting
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   of an object.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   So, you can imagine having an iPad and you want to, oh, I want to throw an object into
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   my pages document or my keynote document.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I can literally take a couple photos of it, get a 3D model, have it, you know, basically
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   imported and probably the same way we see you import photos from an iPhone or an iPad,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   have that pop straight into the document as a 3D model, as a USDZ 3D model that can be
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   rotated around.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And that we're all the hardware there is there to do that in minutes.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   You know, so that is--
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Is that-- is it exposed in an ARKit?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Is there an update to ARKit to expose that or is it a separate function?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Well, USDZ is something that has been rolling around for almost two years now.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And so we keep on seeing it continually progress.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I just remember when Apple announced that at WWC last year.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Yeah, USD-- it was announced two years ago.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And it is USDZ-- or USD is the universal scene description and that is Pixar's transfer format.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And then Apple added a zip to it.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   So it's zipped up into a contained piece.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And so that means you have a contained item that the OS theoretically will support as just
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   a media-- media container in any app that is asking for a media container.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   So it's not just the pages and it could theoretically be any app that can put that in.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   It's just a window that you now have interactivity into.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   And so the ability for the device to be able to gather the information it needs to very quickly
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   identify an object and pop it out or a room and put it in there means that there's a level
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   of fluidity of bringing 3D objects into that.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   And you can imagine not only could you throw it into a page's document or keynote document.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   At some point you can have it in a document where someone clicks on it and picks up their iPad
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   and looks at it, you know, and it just pops into their room.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And so there's all kinds of possibilities here of being able to gather the data.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Because one of the problems is kind of a chicken rag.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   You can build AR and it can do all these models but you need to be able to gather those models as well.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And we have a lot of them right now.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   But people can model them.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   But what if you have something in the field that you want to put into a document?
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And I think that this has all the pieces to allow that to happen.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I don't know how long it's going to take to do it.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   But I think that the hardware is now there.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Is this the same hardware as in the front of the iPhone or is it a different?
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   I don't think it is.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   It's different.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   I don't think it is.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Okay.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Yes, it's different.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   So in other words, no one's had access to this kind of data on an iDevice up to now.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Yeah, I was some Android cameras have had it and they've used it mostly for like portrait mode.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And there was Project Tango, which is one of those things that were super promising.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   But Google didn't commercialize it in the end.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   So a Tango did have it.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   That's interesting.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Okay.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And we had a version of that.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   We played a lot with Tango.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And we played a lot with Tango and it was very powerful.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And it allowed you to start gathering data about scenes.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.800]   I mean, that's a lot of what we used it for was to walk into a location and be able to
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.920]   gather 3D data of that location.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.280]   But they also, it was much more accurate.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.600]   Once you had Tango, when you're using a Tango enabled phone, the accuracy that you got was
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.520]   dramatically better and dramatically faster.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.320]   So it's definitely in the right direction.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:47.560]   I think Google had a lot of power consumption issues with the phone version of it and then
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.320]   stopped even putting it on their own phones.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.800]   And so that made it problematic.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:58.120]   And I'll be interested to see if we see the same thing with iPhones where this sensor makes
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.440]   sense on an iPad.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.080]   I think that it will be difficult for it to work on an iPhone without burning up the
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   battery perfectly.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   So it's just how they use it.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.880]   At least the way it was implemented in Tango, it shortened your battery life dramatically.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.000]   So again, on a larger battery on an iPad, it makes sense.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.640]   The phone, an iPhone might be better at figuring out ways to either alert you that you're about
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.880]   to push the battery pretty hard or push the system pretty hard or other ways to save
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.880]   power.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.440]   Also, more advanced standard.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.280]   It's doing things that Tango did more roughly in a more refined way.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.280]   Yep, yep, absolutely.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:43.640]   So this is exciting, although I have to say all the AR apps we've seen up to this point
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.360]   can work just fine on the iPhone without any depth sensing.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.680]   If you watch that video that I put it up on my Instagram channel, but if you watch that,
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:56.280]   they have like the developer from Hotlava and a couple of the and from my other places.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.760]   That is it is just like and I've had a chance to use it.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.320]   Like I was walking around my my condo like measuring everything and it is so fast.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.880]   It does the same things, but it does it so fast that it's sort of like you forget that
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.480]   it's AR after a few seconds.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.480]   Interesting.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.880]   And I think everybody knows what we're seeing.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.320]   I think what we're seeing is a very slow role.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.680]   This is what we're used to seeing from Facebook and Google and other folks is kind of like
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.480]   we're going to throw up something, we're going to see how people react to it and then we're
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.760]   going to kind of just keep on responding or we're going to give up.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.680]   Whereas what we're seeing with from Apple is this kind of very slow over two or three
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.600]   years slowly just unwrapping this to make sure that there's a whole environment that's
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.400]   available as they release future hardware and software.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.600]   I just want to ask does anybody know like how close the 3D resolution of the 3D scanner
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600]   is?
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.760]   Like is it now good enough that you could capture an object into 3D as opposed to figuring out
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.480]   where the table is and where to put the little Pokemon onto?
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.400]   Because I think that'll be one I think that'll be one of the big crackers of the technology.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.640]   The first thing is the Pokemon one.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.560]   Renee would agree with that.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.200]   No, but you need something to get, you always need something to de-stress people.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.520]   Memoji was brilliant not because, like, emoji is really goofy but it was brilliant at getting
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.160]   people to be comfortable with putting themselves or representations of themselves into AR space.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.600]   It took all the stress and anxiety and everything out of that.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.800]   It wasn't like, oh, why is the machines scanning my face and I don't understand what that.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.480]   It's like, oh, look, it animated me and it was just an easy to grasp concept.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.600]   I have suspected that I don't think it's ready yet.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.920]   I think Apple has a really compelling experience coming with the iPhone 12 with this technology
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.120]   and I don't think it'll be you, emoji, where suddenly I can turn lorients like a unicorn.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   Oh, that would be fun.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   Oh, wow.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.600]   But there'll be something else that lets you play with AR and then once people play with
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.200]   it, they're more and more comfortable.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.080]   And then when it goes onto the glasses, like we've had privacy issues with or just like
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.840]   people feeling awkward about Google Glass when you have a camera on, but LiDAR is not
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   a camera.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   No one's actually looking at you.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.400]   It's just getting a sense of space.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.560]   And they can do a lot without actually looking at you.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.960]   And I think that's going to be a big step forward for these technologies.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:07.440]   And again, the LiDAR doesn't have to be accurate enough to get the model.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.200]   It needs to be accurate enough to inform the photogrammetry to get the model.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.480]   So the photogrammetry by itself has a hard time referencing it, but what you have here
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.160]   is a LiDAR scanner right next to the camera.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.200]   So it can basically sync up the information from the two of those as it's working.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:29.920]   And so it's able to drive a lot of data, almost infinite, not infinite, but just millions
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.880]   and millions and millions of points from the photogrammetry.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:39.240]   It just needs to very easily be able to reference those back to an underlying structure of structured
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.160]   data that it actually knows is true.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.160]   I wonder if that's why we have those together.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.360]   And these devices or might have more RAM as a device.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.360]   Also photoshopped.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.840]   Also photoshopped.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.800]   Potentially, this is one of the most exciting releases in the last couple of years.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:59.600]   Being able to combine these, at least for people who are interested in content of all
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:05.360]   kinds, it is an extremely exciting piece of hardware if it lives up to that.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.840]   And it'll take a little while for it to progress.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.600]   I mean, we're just seeing the hardware and now the developers have to take advantage
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   of it.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   And I didn't see examples.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.440]   I saw a couple examples where you can see it start to grab data from the scene.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.960]   So it's building out the tables and this is in the what Renee posted.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.160]   So building out the tables and building out those pieces.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   And what you'll notice is that it grabs some of the information is that you keep moving
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   or get closer.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.440]   It starts adding more to the corners and everything else.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:35.520]   And so it's kind of an amazing, you know, for people like me that I started doing this
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.240]   in the 90s by hand where you just matched it with your eye.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.960]   That's what's far on the show, Alex speaking.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.960]   I was saying that this is amazing, that this is an iPad.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:54.960]   I just remember how transformative it was when the first platform that had access to
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.080]   an affordable color scanner.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:03.000]   And now some of your friends have actual pictures of their kids as opposed to like,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.560]   oh, well, here's a link to someplace where you can go order a copy of this photo.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.520]   The same thing for the first generation of hardware that could actually burn an audio
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   CD.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.360]   And I think that the turning point for, I wouldn't say AR, but bigger than AR, just acceptance
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:23.040]   of 3D as an object type, as a data type, as a feature of apps is going to be when you
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.440]   can have you can go into a museum.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.600]   And if you're lucky enough that you go to the Smithsonian where they have, you can actually
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.720]   get 360 degrees around a certain statue to say, I really like that statue.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.800]   I want to steal a copy of it for myself so that I can enjoy it at home, whether it's
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.200]   just to simply have it in an album where you could just go around it again or even throw
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:50.240]   it into a 3D printer and make your own copy of this 1892 34 inch bronze.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.640]   I think that's when people are really going to sit up and take notice.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.680]   So that's what I'm really looking forward to.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.280]   I'm looking forward to how well the understanding of the shape of the environment is going to
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.600]   affect photography alone.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.840]   That in itself should be amazing.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:10.320]   But the time when you can actually decide to not just take a picture of your kid in their
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.040]   six year old in their Halloween costume, but take a 3D model of it and be able to revisit
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.200]   it years later, that's I think is what's going to get people to say, you know what?
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.600]   I think I will go for the pro model or this or I think that I am ready to go for this
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600]   instead.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   And also take a picture of your kid and printed.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.600]   I mean, like I was reading a model of your kid.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.600]   You have little action figures.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.600]   You've got little action figures.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.760]   It's 3D prints of your kids.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.880]   And so that all that stuff is not very far away.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.720]   I mean, how many times have you seen Apple put in these hardware features and nobody uses
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.600]   them or they get ignored?
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.880]   You think this will be used.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.080]   People will be so excited about this.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.080]   They'll jump out with software.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.920]   I think the big thing is that getting it into the OS and really seeing it as a data type
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.080]   that we're seeing on many apps, it'll probably first Apple's app.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.080]   Yeah, but that was two years ago.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   They did that, right?
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.120]   No, no, they haven't.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.200]   You can't add a 3D object like this.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.840]   You can't add a USDZ object into pages or into keynote yet.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:17.520]   So, those are things that if once that happens and I truly believe that there's an explosive
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:24.920]   market that once keynote is able to use USDZ, 3D apps and everything else because there's
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:31.400]   going to be strong demand for affordable 3D objects that you can throw in.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.720]   So, think of all of the icons that you can throw into keynote right now, those little
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.040]   blue ones that you can choose.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.160]   Imagine all of those being objects.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.160]   You can just throw in.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.200]   Microsoft had a big education event a couple of years ago where they really went all out.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.960]   It's going to be a 3D world.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.880]   We're going to show you how to do all this stuff and they did a lot of demos of it and
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.400]   it just died on the vine.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   It was.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.000]   I don't think it's dying though.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.320]   I think what you have to remember is that AR and VR are so new right now that there's
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.520]   like basically the back end of it is being built.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:12.520]   And once that's all established and in place, then, you know, that developers get to come
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.400]   in and actually turn that infrastructure into something cool.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.560]   So, I don't think it is dying.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.800]   I think they're just, they're trying to get us excited about what's coming in the future.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:27.000]   But like we see it as some sort of like, you know, failed attempt, but actually it's all
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   still happening.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.080]   It's all still being built.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.920]   We're just not seeing that because that's all the background work that, you know, the
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.120]   ugly stuff that we're not impressed with, you know.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.120]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:45.760]   Apple also has a unique opportunity in that Microsoft and Google, they can suggest hardware
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.200]   support and hardware features, but then it's up to the manufacturers to actually implement
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.200]   them.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.080]   And not only implement them on the software side and the hardware side, they can also
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.280]   throw elbows with the developer community and say, "Oh, that's a very, very nice text-based
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.840]   note processor.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.720]   By the way, we will not allow the next version to the App Store unless your note taker also
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.600]   supports 3D objects supported by our new API."
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.600]   Okay.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:16.160]   And I think it's going to be, if it, you know, maybe it'll take, they have a lot of time
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.560]   to work on this, I guess.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:23.400]   But, you know, this is a very long game that we're slowly seeing, you know, kind of open
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.400]   up.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.320]   When we look at the mouse support, for instance, that we saw, the issue you get into is that
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.160]   they didn't do that because someone asked for it in the fall or in June, they didn't
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.160]   kind of pop it out.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.440]   I mean, that takes a long time to develop that.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.280]   You know, and so the, you know, in the same way, I think this is, we just have to remember
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.680]   this is a long pipeline.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.920]   And if it's not successful, I think I still feel like Apple is going to keep building it,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.200]   you know, and slowly find its place.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.600]   And if it is successful, what happens is if you don't have a Mac, or if you don't have
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.480]   an Apple, he's a hardware and this starts to take off, it would take years for everybody
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   else to come up and speak.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.960]   I think the key thing is that Tim Cook talks about it and he doesn't talk about many products.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.640]   And I think that's because he doesn't see it as a product.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.200]   He sees it as LCD.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.760]   Like you have a display now.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.600]   Your iPhone has a display, your iPad has a display, your Mac has a display.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.840]   He thinks that AR is going to be a display technology and it's going to be surfaced everywhere
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.680]   in glasses in all these different products and they want to have a huge amount of developer
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.600]   experience and internal knowledge by the time those next generation products arrive.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.480]   And we're dealing with the awkward, I'm holding this iPad in front of my face now to see the
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.480]   thing.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.920]   But one day we won't be and they'll be, they'll have a huge amount of experience and software
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.200]   behind it when we are.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   And it's all dripping in.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:38.880]   You know, when you look at media, the, the AR composer, AR, you know, AR creator, AR
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.800]   converter, those are key pieces that without those, it was really hard to get data in.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.200]   And now developers can simply, you know, grab a model and throw it in and have it, have
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.920]   it working and see how it, how it goes.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.360]   And so we're just seeing all of these little pieces get assembled and they're being released
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:59.160]   for us so that the folks who understand what, what's possible can get to work and start
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.440]   figuring out what they can do with it before you try to roll it out.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.760]   And I think that that cadence is really complicated and really difficult.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.320]   It's also super key to everything else they're doing because these aren't all separate things.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   Like when you look at like their special projects, for example, everything from Titan
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:18.040]   automation to the AR stuff, a lot of that depends on computer vision on scene understanding.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.480]   Even the stuff we have in today's iPhone 11 camera where it does semantic modeling to
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.960]   understand what, what's hair and what texture that should have and what's sky.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.600]   All of that counts on them being able to ingest information from the real world and
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.280]   understand it in silicon.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.440]   And this, even with this iPad, they're doing a lot of things to make sure the neural engine
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.760]   and the computer vision system understand what's coming in from the time of flight sensor and
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.040]   the LiDAR system, and that is just going to keep building as well and build up their knowledge.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.540]   All right.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.360]   And it's probably why they put eight lanes of GPU in there too.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.360]   They put more RAM.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   They probably, I bet you they put beefier battery because I would imagine it have the
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.040]   same problem Tango had of eating the battery.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.200]   So it runs interestingly.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.760]   It can run continuously, but developers can also choose how often they sample it.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.600]   And my guess is going to depend on the application and some of them will just race to sleep and
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   be super efficient.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.200]   But like when you're, if you're Alex and you're life scanning your entire castle, my word
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   alarm.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.720]   What's, and give me an application that we, I mean, you know, they showed hot lava makes
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.720]   sense.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.720]   You're holding up your iPad.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.480]   There's lava on the living room floor.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.640]   You can have your little man jumping around in your living room.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.440]   That's interesting, not compelling.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.920]   I don't think anybody's going to hold up their iPad for more than an hour.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   That's the kind of thing you go.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.920]   Okay, fine.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.720]   They show the Ikea app.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   We've already seen that.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.920]   You could put furniture in your living room.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.920]   Tell me the killer app.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   It's not out yet.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.920]   It's already exist.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:45.240]   What, what's going to come out that's going to make everybody go, I get it.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.240]   It's Apple's AR camera.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.880]   They've been working on it for like three, four years.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.320]   And I've been hearing about it for three, four years and everyone's like, super-fied
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   with it.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.160]   And I hopefully again, it'll do what the true depth camera like what's, if you could
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.880]   get the same people who love selfies today to be super invested in what they can create
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.240]   on Instagram and Snapchat and bite and all these other platforms, like even Alex's kids
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.760]   with a rear-facing camera that understands exactly what's behind you can place objects
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.920]   in space, can change your masks, can change your appearance.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.240]   Samsung demoed that with the Galaxy S.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.600]   Samsung has done so many things before, Apple.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.520]   Yeah, but I'm just saying it was a cool demo.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.960]   They showed how you could shoot somebody.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.240]   You get a 3D model of them like that.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   You can animate it.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.480]   You could put it, move it around.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.480]   They showed it.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   Nobody ever used it again.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.520]   It was, it's a feature I can't even remember how to get to in the S10+.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520]   And then it'll be glasses.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520]   It'll be glasses.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.280]   Is it that these are poorly implemented?
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.440]   Is that why they don't take off?
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.600]   Yeah, it's like, it's like ho-hum.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.600]   Who cares?
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.960]   It's a lot of work, right?
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.120]   It's an ecosystem though.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.000]   You have to have the creation tools.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.960]   The developers have to understand it.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.280]   You have to have the distribution.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.600]   You have to have all of those things.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   This is the one we want.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   That's what I'm asking you.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.640]   So what's going to be the app that's going to get the normal person to go, I have to
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.640]   have that.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.440]   What does the AR camera do that's different?
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.200]   What makes that so special?
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.880]   It's really getting that accurate information and being both.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   No, no, no, yeah, yeah, that's all.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.880]   But I'm saying that is.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.720]   My mom, my dad, I don't care about that.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   I don't care about Ikea or Hot Lava.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.440]   What's the thing that's going to make me say, I've got to have this?
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:22.680]   I think a camera that you can use in, you know, like to take a full 3D picture of your
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.000]   kid, like that's a win.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.040]   I think that's a big one.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.240]   I think like a camera that can actually do something like that, that's going to get grandma
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.240]   taken pictures of the grandkids because it can get them front side, back side, get the
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.120]   whole 3D image of them and then look at that picture and spin it around and show, you know,
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.480]   everything else within that frame.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.600]   I think that's a big one.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   If it's done right, I think that'll be a winner.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.600]   Virtual Timmy's cleaning his room.
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.200]   Why isn't real Timmy cleaning his room?
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.600]   Look, Virtual Timmy's doing his chores.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.880]   Sounds like a gimmick to me.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.880]   What else?
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.880]   Well, I guess the thing is that I don't think-
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.880]   The glass is Leo.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.840]   It's all comes down to the glasses, right?
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.040]   It's not this fun factor.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.680]   It's some later form factor.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   And iPad is a big one.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.320]   I don't think I had to add.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.200]   I don't think it's this one factor at all.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.720]   I think this is allowing developers to look at it.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.000]   This is allowing people who understand it to look at it.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   I think that when it's in the phone, when it's in other hardware, when it's in those
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.720]   things, that's those are the killer apps.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   And I think that also-
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.280]   Well, then that says you should not go out and buy this iPad for that feature because
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   there ain't going to be-
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.280]   Unless you're a developer.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   Alex should, right.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   There is no-
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   Right.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   No, absolutely.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   I don't think-
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.800]   I think that if you get in a new iPad, it's great.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   You know, like you should buy a new iPad if you understand what-
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.880]   If you need- if you really want the, you know, the trackpad stuff, if you really want
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.880]   the LiDAR stuff, there's-
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.880]   There's, you know, there's- and the wide angle, which by the way, the number one feature in
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.880]   my new iPhone or the new-ish iPhone that I have is that ultra wide.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.600]   It is the most amazing little camera.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.080]   And I take so many pictures with it.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.080]   I will give you that.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   Absolutely.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.920]   So, so there's other reasons to buy the iPad.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.280]   This is- this is not- you know, when you buy- with the watch, I look at the watch.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.320]   To me, there's no killer app in the watch.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.440]   The- the- there's nothing particularly special about it, but there's enough little things
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.880]   that it does that I would never go back to having an old- old-fashioned watch.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.280]   You know, and I wouldn't use anybody else's because it ties into my life and it's- it's-
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.440]   it's not shockin' off.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:17.200]   It is just good enough that I won't use anything else.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.720]   And- and I think that what we're gonna see is a lot of things happen when, you know,
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.960]   as Apple slowly rolls this out, what you're doing is again, slowly allowing people because
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.880]   you can't- you can't just pop out with this because you can't keep it secret.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.000]   So- so the thing is, is that you have to roll out pieces of this.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.560]   Now all of their partners and all of the developers can sit there and work on ideas and put-
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.160]   you know, the stuff that we saw from the- the- the- those there, it's using, you know,
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.120]   somewhat open stuff so people kind of know.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.760]   So it's this slow drip out.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.600]   And I don't think it has to be a killer app.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.880]   I think it's the fact that Achaia isn't incorporating it and Home Depot's incorporating
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.520]   it and, you know, a whole bunch of other people are incorporating it.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.520]   I think that that is, you know, where you start seeing it pop up everywhere.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.520]   And the hard part for, you know, Apple's competition is that it's, you know, it's really hard
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.520]   to do.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.760]   Like Apple's doing something that is really, really hard to do well.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.640]   And Samsung, yes, did it half-baked and it didn't come out very well.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.720]   And Google did it half-baked and didn't come out very well.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.280]   I thought you said Tango was good.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.920]   Yeah, it was great, but it didn't work because they didn't, they didn't give it all this
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920]   other support.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.240]   They didn't have the subsystem that would allow you to drop it into different, you know,
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.240]   different locations.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.120]   They required everybody to work really hard to use the piece.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:31.360]   And what Apple's doing is slowly creating that environment that allows for it to be
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:37.720]   successful so that when it becomes a consumer solution, there's a lot of partners and developers
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.120]   who, you know, understand what they can do with it.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.200]   And I think that that, you know, and that is an extremely difficult thing to do.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.040]   And it's almost impossible to do if you don't own the hardware and the software infrastructure.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.960]   And you have the money to just throw.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:57.480]   I can't even imagine how much money at rolling this out slowly over years.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   You know, and it's, it's a, you know, and what it means is, and I think the reason that
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.040]   we see Tim Cook constantly talking about it, because he knows he's playing a game that
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.960]   almost nobody else can play with him.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.600]   You know, and if it's successful, it becomes, you know, it's, if it's successful, and I
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.680]   think I think it will be, it becomes very, very hard to replicate.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.960]   And it becomes another iPhone, but even harder.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.240]   This is an iPhone that nobody else can build.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.840]   You know, and, you know, or it'll take people a long time to build it.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.800]   They'll have to, they'll have to support USDZ because they can't build their own format.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.000]   They'll have to, you know, they'll have to take Apple solutions because they don't have
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   any other choice.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   You know, this is, they're just playing such a big game with this that it's going to be
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.680]   very, very, very hard for someone else to compete in this, in this place.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.040]   And our kids will be used to it.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.360]   Our friends will be used to it.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.680]   You know, start, it'll have to take years, but as that happens, other people are going
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.640]   to try to keep up and it's just very, very difficult to do it.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:53.480]   It's a, it's a very hard thing that they're doing, in my opinion.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.480]   It's an interesting situation.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.280]   I can't think of a lot of times a company's released a feature that isn't going to be
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:06.440]   that useful, but they need to seed the market with so that some time down the road when
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:12.440]   they come out with glasses say, especially Apple, that's, that's a big way ahead on this
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.440]   one.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.320]   I was, I was going to say something exactly the same thing, Renee.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.040]   It's, we, off on on the show, we talk about how, well, it's not important that Apple wasn't
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.840]   the first to market with this.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.920]   They're, they can get, they can hang back and actually wait to see what the market, how
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:30.520]   the market responds and then respond to something that's even better.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.600]   This could be the same situation in reverse now, where fine, Apple is, Apple really is
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:40.240]   the only company who can tie in the hardware, the hardware, the OOS, the software and the
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.640]   developer support into one package.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.280]   And I'm sure that all these other companies would very much love to be able to do that.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.040]   They'd be loved, they'd love to be able to do that on, on Windows.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.200]   They'd love to be able to do that on Android, but maybe what they're going to have the opportunity
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.640]   to do instead is to wait to see, wait for Apple to develop this market, wait for Apple
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:03.000]   to, and Apple's developers to develop that killer app that convinces everybody that,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.240]   my God, I really, really want LiDAR on my phone or I really, really want these 3D features
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   on my phone.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.040]   And then instead of having to spend three or four years convincing their manufacturers
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.640]   to fall in line, they can point to here is exactly the product you need to make.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.600]   There is exactly how we should support it.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.440]   And now that we can undercut Apple by $200 per unit and give people the choice of having
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.360]   a headphone jack, if they want one, maybe we can actually, it could be very well on that
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.360]   basis.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.000]   But without the development system, without all the infrastructure that's required to make
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   that work, it's going to be very hard.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.040]   Like it's the problem is there, they'll come in and develop a few years behind.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.720]   Now, it's really, really easy.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.600]   If you have Apple doing the R&D for you to point to you, here is what you need for infrastructure.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.680]   And if there is finally a market for it, the developers of every platform will want to
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.120]   make money on that market.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.200]   So it's not as though they need, Apple needs three, four years to build the support and
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.840]   build this community.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.840]   But I don't think it would take nearly that long of a runway for anybody else to see this
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.480]   success and then replicate it.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.560]   Look what happened with the iPhone.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:08.040]   It took a couple of years for the Android community to find its car keys.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   But once they found those car keys, they were on that highway in the exact same lane
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   as the iPhone.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.240]   But I think the watch is also a good example where there are a whole lot of people that
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.840]   are trying that and they're mostly long.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.360]   That's different because they have no control over hardware.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   Qualcomm is the only manufacturer of CPUs for wearables and they have shown absolutely
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:33.280]   no interest in progressing beyond the same chip they made about three or four years ago.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.240]   So that's not the best comparison, but I do take your point.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.640]   We spent an hour talking about just the camera.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:46.040]   So there are other things to talk about and we will talk about the hinge for the next
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.040]   day.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.040]   Oh, really?
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.040]   Maybe actually I do want to talk about the keyboard.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:56.560]   There's a I think a very important I think moral to drive to derive from the keyboard.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   I also want to talk about the MacBook Air of course, Apple's most popular Macintosh
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:07.320]   by far, probably the world's most popular ultra book I would guess by far.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:15.040]   Renee Ritchie from iMore, also from iMore, Lori Gill, Andy Inaco from WGBH Boston and
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:22.000]   our media guru, Alex Lindsey and Mac Break Weekly continue our show today brought to you
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.520]   by Molecule, the air we breathe.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.240]   You know, I didn't realize this according to the World Health Organization, 80% of people
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:37.280]   living in urban areas are exposed to air quality below standards, below the who standards.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.480]   That's the pollution we live in.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.920]   Not right now, it's getting better, but I don't know if it'll stay that way.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.560]   Indoor air can be five times worse than outdoor air.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.080]   That's according to the EPA.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.880]   And most of us spend most of our time indoors.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:55.680]   A lot of times as I am right now in a sealed office where the only air I'm getting is piped
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   in.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.560]   Molecule is designed to eliminate air pollution.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.400]   In fact, I just read a study from the Lawrence Livermore Labs, the Berkeley Labs, where they
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.760]   took a molecule and they showed that while the molecule is running reduction in ozone
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.840]   by 95% reduction in formaldehyde, that's the stuff coming up off your carpets and your
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.040]   drapes, 95%.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:26.320]   A lot of air purifiers make the air worse by pumping formaldehyde or ozone into the
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.200]   air, not the molecule.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:33.800]   The molecule uses a technology called Pico photoelectrochemical oxidation that destroys
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.920]   volatile organic compounds.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.680]   It doesn't just trap them.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.960]   It's not a filter.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.160]   It destroys them with its Pico system.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.520]   If you go to Molecule.com, Molecule Spell with a K.com, you can see in their white paper
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:53.240]   section studies by the University of Minnesota Particle Calibration Lab, InterTech.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:58.040]   I didn't see the Berkeley Labs study up there yet, but I think that'll be up there soon
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.040]   if it's not already.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:06.080]   So small, as small as 0.1 micron, removed by the molecule air and the air mini during
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:14.640]   a 25-minute test, capture of larger particles dropped from about 3,500 to 600, less than
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.400]   25 minutes.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.840]   The science is in there and you can read the white papers.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:23.960]   I know you might have seen reports from a couple of companies who are testing only the
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.200]   filter portion of it.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.000]   That's not the important part of the molecule.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.640]   It's the Pico filter.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.920]   That's why we have molecules here in the studio.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.600]   We have molecules at home.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:39.600]   I can tell you just purely anecdotally, Lisa always knows if the molecule is not running.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.680]   If somebody unplugs it, our son occasionally will borrow it.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.360]   He has one in his room, but he'll borrow it for his study.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.920]   It's not plugged back in.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.920]   Lisa wakes up.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   She says, "I have a headache.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920]   Where's the molecule?"
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   She'll know.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.920]   Molecule really works air purification for the whole home across a range of products, the
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:04.160]   molecule air for larger rooms like our studio, the molecule air mini for this smaller studio.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.000]   You can also create a bundle.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   They're quiet.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.760]   They work and they've got the science to prove it.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:14.000]   Allergy and asthma sufferers around the country are thrilled about the molecule you
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   will to.

[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   Andy Riecka, Renee Ritchie, Lori Gill, Alex Lindsey, enough about the Lidar.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.960]   That's Mulan.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.400]   Enough about the Lidar.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   Enough about the Lidar.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.200]   I heard the Lidar.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.640]   We get it.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:21.720]   What I was most excited about, despite the price, of course, is the new Magic Keyboard,
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:26.240]   which is $245 for the 11-inch, $345.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:33.360]   It costs more than an Xbox for the 12.9-inch, but what is interesting to me is not the price
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.760]   or the form factor is very interesting, but what it means to me.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.560]   Now, we're all waiting right now for $13.4 to come out.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.120]   Is it going to come out today?
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   It's out.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   Is it out?
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.120]   All right.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.120]   I'll be busy here downloading.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.120]   You guys can discuss while I download.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   I've already been playing around with it.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.920]   Yeah, it's the iPhone I don't care about, but I'm going to install it and everything.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:59.040]   I'll just say, since we shocked everybody with the price of the Magic Keyboard, I was
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:04.000]   so happy that Apple didn't screw this up in the way that Apple kind of tends to screw
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.400]   things up, where it's like, "Oh, man, so I can't get--" Oh, great.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.120]   So I got to have a brand new iPad.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:14.960]   I got to have three or fifty people like Trekware, but no, it will work with Bluetooth so you
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.760]   can bring your own hardware.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:21.520]   Third parties, of course, are supporting it so you can buy a cheaper integrated keyboard.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.680]   And also, it's not just for the iPad Pro.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.720]   You're talking about the trackpad feature.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.920]   I'm talking about the pointer feature, exactly.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.080]   Let's be clear.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.640]   You really confuse me on that one.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.840]   So we're talking about the keyboard, the Magic Keyboard, that will work with the older
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.560]   2018 iPad Pro as well as the current iPad Pro.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:45.200]   It does add a trackpad as well as, I think, have you-- nobody's touched it, right?
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   You guys haven't touched it.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.240]   No, I got to talk about it.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.240]   It's basically the Magic Keyboard.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.080]   So it's the same mechanism as the MacBook Air Magic Keyboard.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.480]   It's got scissor switches in it.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   It is backlit.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.480]   It may win all out.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   It's not this keyboard.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   It's not the smart keyboard.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.240]   No, it's the Magic Air or MacBook 16.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.800]   Magic Keyboard, that's huge.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.240]   With the backlighting, which is also huge because--
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.240]   Backlighting, when scissors are--
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:13.440]   If you're going to go, if you're going to charge, you've got to deliver everything.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.400]   It has a Type-C connector on the hinge.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.400]   Yes.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   Which makes--
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.960]   I mean, when you-- yeah.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.960]   But does it pass data as well?
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.400]   No, it's power pass through.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   So you can charge--
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.400]   It's all charge when you're on the port on the-- yes.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.720]   So you can-- basically, I believe it goes-- it passes power to the smart connector to reverse
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   charge the iPad.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.720]   No data is coming through.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.720]   That's very important.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.920]   No data is coming through the smart connector.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.600]   But it does tell us now why the smart connector on the new iPads is not on the bottom, but
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:45.520]   on the side, even on the 2018, they clearly were anticipating this, right?
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   Because you can't--
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   Keep points for a while.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.000]   Yeah, if it's on the bottom, you can't hinge-- you can't cantilever it up because it'll
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   disconnect.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.160]   So that-- I mean, clearly, this was something they thought about in 2018.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.760]   But to me, why it's significant-- and Andy, we will talk about the trackpad.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   Sorry.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.920]   We will talk about the pointer because I think it's very important.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:08.200]   But I think the larger story to me, especially-- I mean, pricing tells you this.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.680]   The pointer tells you this.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.520]   The new keyboard tells you this.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:17.480]   Because this Apple is now saying the iPad is a laptop, is a portable computer for the
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.480]   rest of us.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.480]   Except for their marketing.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.320]   Their marketing just says-- it does the exact-- so my understanding is this.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:28.760]   Like, they're still full in on the Steve Jobs vision of the iPad as naked tablet for everybody.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:33.480]   For the millions of people who could not use, didn't like, felt stupid by traditional computers.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.520]   You can still buy one, press your home button, tap your apps.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.200]   It'll be super accessible and approachable to you.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:44.000]   But for the traditional computer people who have just been super unsatisfied with that,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.680]   who just wanted their mouse and pointers and keyboards, sort of like what Microsoft has
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.320]   been doing, this is Apple's O to them.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.120]   And I think they very deliberately are showing people tearing it off and putting it on because
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.200]   they want to highlight that it's not just a laptop or a flip phone.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:04.640]   It's an iPad, an honest-to-gosh iPad that you can dock and use like a traditional computer.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.880]   If you're someone like us, if you're someone like all of Tech Twitter who really wants
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.240]   that experience, and then you can pull it off and go back to using your pencil or something
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.240]   if you want to as well.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.400]   Well, that's a mistake.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.760]   They need to-- I think, because this is what Microsoft did and it screwed them.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.200]   They need to decide.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.200]   It's either--
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.600]   Well, it's a small bit of a market for them.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.560]   Or it's the next personal computer.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.600]   So again, my understanding is that a small but very loud portion of the market actually
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.600]   buys you this.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.760]   Why the iPad market share is ridiculous.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.480]   It's essentially an iPad market.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.160]   They sell so many more of the non-pro iPads.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   They don't want to interfere with that.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.680]   So people are super happy with that.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.880]   They understand it.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.360]   But if you do want the other thing, it's like when the Mac originally didn't have arrow
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.680]   keys or a terminal, now it has arrow keys and a terminal.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.240]   You don't have to use them.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.800]   If you just want to use the mouse and pointer, you're fine.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.080]   But for those of us who want the arrow keys and the terminal, it's there and it should
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:01.800]   be and it should be a first-class experience when you offer and provide it.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:09.640]   I do think that this is a concession that maybe Apple should have supported multi-touch
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.960]   on a more powerful desktop class operating system sooner.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:21.520]   Because you see that a lot of commentators are unfairly quoting Tim Cook on his toaster
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:26.360]   fridge comments about having multi-touch on a desktop, which I think that most people
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.040]   thought that, OK, this is marketing.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.040]   This is--
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.080]   God bless you, Tim.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:35.160]   We're flying the colors, but we know that there's a quiver in your eye that says that
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.520]   even you don't believe that.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:42.760]   And I think that this is an acknowledgment that once you charge more than $500 or $600
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:48.280]   for a device, people are going to-- you can call it a newvel tub latte, but people are
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.600]   going to still call it a computer.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.840]   They're going to try to get $500, $600, $8,000, $1,500 worth of value out of it.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:59.720]   And for that, that really does involve being able to not have to take your hands off a
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:05.280]   keyboard every eight seconds into a selection or not have to watch-- which I have done, actually
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:10.040]   have to watch a YouTube video saying, OK, I know that there is a way for me to select
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:14.000]   discontinuously slides in keynote.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.160]   But what is-- I hold-- but then tap and then slide and then two finger.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:23.800]   So I do-- Apple is not required to admit that they're wrong, but I do think that this is
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:29.680]   a concession that perhaps we stuck to our dogmatic guns on this much longer than we should have.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.240]   Especially if people are spending $1,000 on these things.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:37.360]   What if we made three-- OK, I'm going to amend what I was thinking and make three lanes.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.400]   So there's the iPad, the traditional--
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   --your thing, Renee.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.920]   There's the Pro, which I think is-- I think Apple's thinking of, especially because of
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:50.120]   this new keyboard, as the computer for the rest of us.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.920]   And then there's the Truck.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.760]   And I'll tell you my ulterior motives for this.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.240]   There's the Truck, which is the Mac OS stuff.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:01.680]   My ulterior motive is I don't want them to abandon Intel on Mac OS.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.000]   I think that's going to be a disaster.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.360]   I mean, no Apple could-- if anybody could do it, Apple could do it.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.440]   But I just think Arm-- I don't-- I think--
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.440]   I'll be honest, I don't know the problem.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.440]   So this is the SUV?
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:16.400]   Yeah, I don't think-- that's what I'm saying is now I understand they don't need to bother.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.440]   They've got Mac OS, they have a truck.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.120]   There are people like me who want the truck.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.000]   They're going to have that middle ground, which is a laptop computer, but it's touch,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.960]   it's beautiful, it's got all the-- and then they're going to have, I guess, I'll amend
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:35.760]   my thinking to say then there's the inexpensive eye-pads which are consumption devices.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.760]   The 3.49.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.760]   I like this.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.840]   I think that that seems to me a reasonable strategy.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.360]   And I think that maybe that's what Apple's been thinking all along.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.680]   Obviously, this is not something they just made up in the spur of the moment.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.880]   It's been a huge argument, I think, internally.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.440]   And different people have won it.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.160]   And we can see by which products they release.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.520]   And we can see who's been winning it on which side for the years.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.520]   But I think this is a--
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.520]   You think the battle's over?
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.760]   --the announced iPad OS, I think that's real hard to walk back no matter which side of
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.920]   that argument you're on.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.160]   You're now committed to the strategy.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.160]   And I think there's--
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.160]   I think there's--
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:13.800]   I look at my own behavior and I just look at the fact that I use my laptop less and less
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.560]   and less and less, you know, in my iPad more and more and more.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:21.920]   Well, and add this track to that and keyboard, that solves for me except for the missing
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.880]   pro apps, but we'll get to that.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.640]   But that solves to me the biggest complaint about this.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.800]   Now I can have the fine control.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.880]   What was your complaint too as I remember, Alex?
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:37.640]   It's like when I'm using-- when I'm building-- I mean, an omnigraffal building wiring documents,
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.880]   it's very hard to do that with your finger.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:40.880]   Just you just can't--
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.880]   Because you're moving so fast and you're doing all these little bits and pieces.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:48.240]   And it's just very, very difficult to try to do that by hand and with your hand.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:53.840]   And so using a trackpad, I think that I would go right back to omnigraffal and try to take
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.400]   advantage of that in that app as an example.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   But there are so many places.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.920]   The same things you were talking about, whether it's-- Andy was talking about with
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:06.360]   the keynote in pages, all these things in numbers, all these things are a lot easier
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.160]   to do in many apps.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.120]   And there'll be a handful of apps that I have to go back to my computer for because
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.280]   the-- just because they're not available.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.520]   But that's the only reason I'm going back to them.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.960]   You'll still need a truck.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.320]   I'm not going to do development on this new iPad form factor.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.120]   I'm not a video entity.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:29.800]   Did anyone else see the comment on their thing about external displays for your iPad?
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.280]   Oh, isn't that interesting?
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.960]   It said, those have always worked.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.760]   The only difference is now the trackpad works with them as well.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.080]   Yeah, I looked at that.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.760]   I was like external displays.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.240]   I didn't even think about connected external display.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.840]   I think of my iPad as an external display for my Mac.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.280]   But I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, OK, display, Alex.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.600]   You can buy a pro-- like a pro display XDR and hook your iPad up right now.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   That says something about the power in this thing too.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.560]   I mean, these things are incredibly powerful.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:02.080]   And I just feel like there is now a very clear path forward for Apple that doesn't require
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:08.040]   putting ARM on Mac OS on ARM and messing with the Macs, which aren't a big product category
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.040]   for them.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.520]   But they have to have them for developers and for editors and people like that.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.480]   Marques Brownlee is never going to-- I don't think Marques Brownlee is ever going to move
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.080]   his 8K workflow to an iPad Pro.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.080]   No, Tom--
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.080]   No, Tom--
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:24.080]   No, it's not a good one.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   But it's not a good one.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.080]   It's not a good one.
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.200]   Yeah, he did a demo of it with a little bit.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.840]   But you wouldn't do it all the time, probably.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.840]   Right?
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:36.800]   But having seen all these videos, it does make me a little bit melancholy because I feel
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:43.720]   as though what we're seeing today in iPad OS 13.4 and to a lesser extent, the new hardware,
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:50.920]   we're seeing what Mac OS could be if Apple could get themselves as excited about desktop
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.120]   OSs as they were about iOS.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.360]   I really do think there's a dogmatic thing inside Apple where iOS is the future.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.000]   ARM processors are the future.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.080]   Mac OS is important and it's wonderful and we love it.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:08.360]   But this is the boring four-door family sedan that we will continue to sell because they
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.560]   continue to sell.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:14.360]   But we are more excited about these high-performance hybrid whatever.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:20.560]   The fact that the Mac is still-- I still feel like it's a very stodgy platform.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.560]   I love it.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.120]   I use it daily and I have no desire to switch from it.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.800]   But you compare it to Linux builds.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.560]   You compare it to even Chrome OS.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.000]   You compare it to Windows these days.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.240]   And it really does feel like we're back in 2002, 2003.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:39.280]   So this is why-- I'm very happy for what's been happening with the iPad.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:44.120]   I'm seriously considering-- I bought the first generation iPad Pro as soon as it came out.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.440]   And I haven't upgraded it since because it's been doing so well for me.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:53.680]   I'm considering buying a new iPad Pro this fall maybe based on how important the improvements
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.840]   since all those years ago are.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:01.840]   But nonetheless, I can't help but think that, God, how much better could the Mac be right
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:07.480]   now if only there were people who are as passionate about moving that platform forward and making
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:13.080]   it competitive and making it two steps ahead of the competition as well as they're dogmatically
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:17.680]   tied to making sure the iPad Pro has that position inside the industry.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.640]   It just makes me a little bit sad.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:24.320]   The problem with changing Mac OS though is that you have to remember that a lot of people
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.960]   are very reliant on exactly how it already works.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:32.840]   And when you make major changes and you switch things up really crazy, that interrupts our
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.840]   workflow.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.640]   That interrupts literally what we do with our lives.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:41.000]   And not everybody is great at adapting to new things.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:48.880]   So I think that Apple does still do this and still does love Mac OS, but they roll out
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:54.400]   major feature changes in very small increments so that it doesn't negatively affect our day
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.000]   to day use of our Macs.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.400]   So it's just going slower, but it is still happening.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:05.000]   And I think it's good that it's going slower because I would hate to wake up one morning
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.360]   and not be able to figure out how to use my computer.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:13.320]   And just so there, I think that does happen with Windows a lot when major Windows updates
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.320]   happen.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.840]   People have been in the past like, where's that button that I've always known where it
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.080]   was or that drop down menu.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.160]   And that's just a bad user experience.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.200]   So I think Apple is still working with Mac.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.440]   They're just rolling it out slower.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.440]   Those are good points.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:37.680]   What was real I open for me as a user was when I started using my ThinkPad, like in the regular
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:41.800]   rotation, as opposed to it used to be just the thing that would be on a shelf, uncharged.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   I would charge it up whenever I needed to test something that was Windows only and I couldn't
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.760]   run it on my Mac in emulation.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:53.920]   And the more that I started to realize that if it, I had, and I had one of the newer Mac
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:59.760]   books with the .58 millimeter travel keyboard for a couple months at a time, two times,
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:03.960]   and the number of times that occurred to me that I like the Mac more than I like.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:09.080]   I like Mac OS more than I like Windows 10, but I don't like it so much more that I would
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.800]   not switch to this ThinkPad full time if Apple decided that we are never, ever, ever making
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.720]   a MacBook with a keyboard that I like.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:22.960]   And that scared me that the idea that they would ever be so close that I would, so close
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:31.040]   in Windows and Mac would be so close in features and usability to me and the quality for me
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:36.000]   of the hardware would be such a gulf that I would even consider switching under those
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.600]   circumstances that really made me think that Apple has really not been pushing themselves
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.880]   to develop Mac as hard as they would.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:51.320]   And to be fair to Microsoft, they had an even bigger installed base than Mac OS and switching,
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:56.840]   making a multi-touch and making the new UI part of the Windows experience.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:02.160]   That was a long hard road, killed with screws and nails in which everybody would say, "Oh
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.160]   my God, this sucks so hard."
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.040]   Like, "I'm telling people don't upgrade, don't upgrade."
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:11.440]   And people sticking with Windows 7 for as long as they possibly could before it took as
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:15.640]   I like, I keep using the saying because I like the saying before Windows found the car
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:16.640]   keys.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.240]   There's a time where they're fumbling and they're padding pockets, they're really not,
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.800]   you wonder if they're ever going to get going, but at some point they get it all together
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.760]   in which, "Okay, great, now we can put on our codes because it looks like Dad is actually
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.560]   Dad and Mom actually have the keys in the car, we're actually going somewhere."
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.320]   All right, now you could talk about the trackpad.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:41.800]   Let me tell you, I have it installed right now on my iPad.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.280]   Look, look, it's all...
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.280]   And then...
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.280]   Everything's rebooted.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.280]   There's no point...
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:50.280]   13, 4 on the iPhone, you said, "Don't bother, no, you want the fixes."
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:51.280]   But that's not the touch.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.280]   Well, you...
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.920]   And you want the mimeogee, of course.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   Yes.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.920]   But the touch is all about...
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:56.920]   Yeah, and I've got...
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:57.920]   This is all about the touch.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.480]   I've got the bridge keyboard hooked up to it right now.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.760]   And there's a couple of little things that are really great.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:07.240]   Now, literally, I installed this right before we got on camera, so I have not had a lot
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.520]   of time to play with it.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:13.600]   But there's one thing that I like about the usability of this now.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.160]   So the little bar that appears at the bottom of your iPhone or iPad that you use to swipe
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:25.960]   up, if you use a trackpad, all you have to do is hover over that line and tap.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.640]   And that does the same thing as the swipe up.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.520]   You don't have to swipe up anymore.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:35.000]   You just tap your trackpad and it does the swipe up for you.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.020]   That is a primo little edition.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:43.940]   That was one of my pain points with the older cursor was that I would have to press down
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.580]   on the trackpad and use the other finger to swipe up.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.540]   But it's a very awkward experience.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.900]   You don't have to do that anymore.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:56.060]   You also, when you hover your cursor over an app, the app kind of grows a little bit.
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:57.700]   It highlights a little bit.
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.460]   It's very, very nice looking.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.580]   I love the way buttons.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.580]   The arrow turns...
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:09.180]   The giant Syracuse's ghost finger turns into a button when you hover over a button.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:15.580]   These are things that a Mac doesn't and probably wouldn't ever do that makes a lot of sense.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.580]   They didn't port it over.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.860]   They did a whole new concept.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:22.420]   They thought it was designed for it.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.420]   I'm sorry, Laurie.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.140]   I feel like this is an improvement.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.180]   I feel like this is going to be...
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.180]   They were right...
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.260]   I almost don't want to admit this.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:35.180]   You're right not to put touch on Mac OS.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:36.580]   Is that nutty to say?
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.580]   No, I didn't.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:38.580]   They didn't have to.
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:40.580]   The Windows had to, literally had to make...
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:41.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.580]   They had no choice.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.580]   They had nothing to do with.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.580]   Apple's stock.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.580]   Google only has new operating systems.
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.780]   Microsoft only had a functional old operating system which they brought forward and Apple
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.100]   sort of had both and is trying to...
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.820]   A lot of stock people would love them to just get rid of the Mac and focus on iOS for
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:55.820]   their bottom line.
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.820]   But they love the Mac.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:57.820]   It's not going anywhere yet.
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.060]   And so they're maintaining that and they're working on this new thing.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:05.140]   And that's sort of a rock and a hard place in terms of making both things do everything.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.740]   Laurie, can I just plug in a mouse?
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.300]   You have that bridge keyboard, which isn't out yet.
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.300]   Yeah, you can...
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:15.700]   In fact, if I'm not mistaken, as soon as you connect with Bluetooth, even...
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.780]   You don't even have to plug it in, but even with Bluetooth, it automatically just finds
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:20.780]   it.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.540]   You don't have to go into any settings or anything.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.420]   It just automatically grabs it and finds it.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:30.780]   And then you'll see a little light colored dot or like a transparent dot will appear
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.780]   on your screen.
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.220]   Can I use my ad capture if it's already paired?
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:38.460]   You have to unpair it from the old thing before it'll work on the new thing.
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.460]   So it doesn't pair to multiple devices?
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.380]   I don't believe so, no.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.380]   But I can't...
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.380]   I see I have a Magic Trackpad.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:46.340]   I've never used because I really don't like it.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.340]   But do it.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.340]   And you can connect to your Magic Trackpad.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:49.340]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:50.340]   That might be perfect.
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.340]   One of my core friends was using that in the beta.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:53.340]   Can I just say...
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.980]   I'm sorry, I did a spoiler at the beginning of the show.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:57.980]   Say it again.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:58.980]   I'm just so excited about it.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.980]   Say it again.
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:03.940]   I was partly thinking that I'm sure that Apple wants to create the best consumer experience
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.340]   they possibly can.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:09.340]   And that would mean that if they think that the best consumer experience means that this
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:15.500]   feature will only work with Apple branded touch hardware like the Magic Keyboard and
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.380]   the $350 keyboard cover.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.100]   I could see that happening and I would mourn it very, very horribly.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:26.260]   But to find out that it does work with USB mice, it works with Bluetooth mice.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.780]   Not only that, but it works.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.780]   I'm trying to...
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.340]   Getting conflicting reports from my understanding is that it works on every single iPad Pro model,
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:39.500]   including the one that I bought in what, 2018, 2017, 2016.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   And that I don't need...
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:47.100]   And that even on some newer iPad minis, that makes me so happy.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.420]   Anything that can run iOS 13.4, it should work with.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   Yep.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.140]   Which is just absolutely awesome.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:58.140]   And I hope I wasn't being cynical and I'm just bracing myself for, "Oh, let's not make
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:02.780]   this exclusive to the iPad Pro 2019/2020."
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.020]   And I also think that it gives Apple some freedom to charge whatever they're going to
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.620]   charge and build whatever they want to build.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.340]   It's the same thing as their new monitor with the stand.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:16.100]   They want to build a stand that looks a certain way and acts a certain way.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.100]   And so they're going to build it at the level that they want to build it at.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:23.660]   They didn't make you pay for it when you bought it and anybody else can build something for
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:24.660]   it.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:32.740]   And I think that in many ways, free is Apple to let their attention to detail free.
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:38.020]   And charge whatever it's what it costs to do it.
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.820]   It's a great thing for the entire Apple line because I will never stop at least nudging
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:48.500]   Apple saying, "Oh, it's too bad that your cheapest MacBook is still kind of at the
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.340]   middle price structure or even at the start of the high price structure for notebooks."
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:58.020]   But I can give them a lot of slack for that because if you are on a budget, you can spend
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:05.260]   $329 plus now like $30 for a Bluetooth keyboard, $20 for a Bluetooth mouse, and get something
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:11.660]   that for the expectations of someone who would be going into a store to spend $450 on a notebook
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:15.700]   would give an experience as probably that's as good as anything you could buy for less
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.980]   than $500 and better than most of them.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:24.500]   So I will always say, Gee, I really wish I could find a way to make a $600 or $700 notebook,
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:30.220]   but I can't complain that hard when they create something as incredibly impressive as the
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:35.180]   $350 iPad and charge $350 for it.
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:37.580]   Okay.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.580]   You convinced me.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:45.660]   I have a feeling we're going to see the Apple.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:49.980]   Magic keyboard with trackpad for iPad.
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:54.140]   I think we're going to see it for the regular iPads, not just for iPad Pro.
[01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.140]   It may be less expensive one.
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.140]   I know it's really expensive.
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:00.420]   But without the cantilever maybe or maybe something like that, or maybe even the exact
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.620]   same price point.
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:09.900]   And just, you know, if you want the $350 iPad and a $300 keyboard to go with it, here you
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.900]   go.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:15.060]   It's a lot less ungainly than having a separate keyboard and a separate trackpad or a matter
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.060]   of time.
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.540]   And the large a tape is making them and then a bunch of third parties are going to make
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.260]   the trackpad keyboards for all the iPhone.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:20.580]   Also all the iPad models.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:21.580]   Oh, interesting.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:28.100]   Apple made so many iPad users happy, not just by having a trackpad and trackpad support,
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:34.580]   by designing this $300, $350 Magic keyboard cover that you can actually now actually put
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:40.420]   it on your lap and use it on your lap for the first time in iPad history practically.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:44.860]   That shows that they weren't just saying, Hey, look, why are we charging this much
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.660]   money for a keyboard cover?
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.580]   Let me explain about the grade of aluminium that we're using on this.
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.740]   It's like, no, we've actually thought about it.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:56.700]   We've made this for the people who actually want to spend money on the best, the best
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.940]   execution of this concept.
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.100]   We've got it for you.
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:05.740]   I think one of the greatest ideas for why I think that they created the hovering display
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:10.500]   is so that they could maximize the amount of space that the keyboard and trackpad fit
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.500]   on.
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:17.380]   Because you're not limited by you have to cut off the keyboard in order for the screen
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.900]   to look how much you lose on this.
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:21.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:27.700]   So if you raise this up, you can have a whole lot more space for real size keys.
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.420]   Like you want a good trackpad that has space.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:35.340]   It doesn't have to be as big as the new iPad Air or something like that.
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:40.020]   But that's one of the most important things in my opinion is that trackpad needs to be
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:44.060]   comfortable for all of your fingers to do the things that you want them to do with all
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.900]   that multi touch gesturing and stuff.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:53.460]   So it was really incredibly smart for them to widen that space that you use.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:58.500]   Let's take a break because we haven't even gotten to the MacBook Air yet.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.460]   They've right had a stepchild.
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.660]   I always thought the last to be mentioned.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:07.900]   I am a MacBook Air fan.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:15.260]   And to make a more powerful MacBook Air with a keyboard I can use, that's huge for me.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.780]   So we'll talk about that and gold.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.260]   But we'll talk about that a little bit.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.700]   First I want to talk about keyboards.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:21.700]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.700]   I know you're all keyboard fanatics.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:29.140]   You know, the Apple keyboards have come and gone, but there's a company, Metaius created
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:33.740]   by a keyboard fanatic like us Edgar Metaius.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:38.620]   And he is keeping alive all of the original Mac keyboard styles and designs.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:44.860]   If you liked, I really liked the mechanical clicky keyboard that came with the old iMacs.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.020]   I love those.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.540]   You can get these beautiful aluminum keyboards.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.260]   This is, I think, one of their best sellers right now.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.980]   This is the Wired Aluminum 10 Keyless.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:58.340]   So they have with 10 key, you know, if you want the, if you're entering a lot of numbers
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.460]   or without, and I just want it without.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.980]   So it's a little more compact.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:04.180]   Beautiful aluminum construction.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.740]   Backlit, I love this feature.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:09.780]   It's got a little dial here that I can choose the color of the backlighting.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:14.340]   It goes through the whole spectrum and I can just, you know, scroll through it.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.340]   Plus these are made for Macintosh.
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.860]   Now you can use these with other operating systems.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:23.500]   In fact, they have one keyboard that has four Bluetooth buttons, does multi-point pairing.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.860]   You press button one.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:26.260]   That could be, let's say, your Mac.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.940]   Button two could be a Windows machine.
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:31.820]   It assigns all the keys to be Windows specific or Mac specific.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:37.780]   I love it though that I can get a keyboard that doesn't have, you know, the Windows key
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:39.460]   where the command key should be.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:45.340]   It has all the right function keys, expose, brighter and darker, the media control functions,
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.780]   the speaker function.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:49.740]   It's got a backlight key too, which you can turn on and off.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:52.220]   I just think this is the greatest keyboard ever.
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:54.140]   And man, does it feel good.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.240]   Matias.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.380]   You want to get your keyboards from a keyboard fanatic like Edgar Matias.
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.860]   They have a complete range of options to choose from.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.420]   They've been making keyboards since 1989.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:10.260]   I think it was back then that Edgar said, "I want to make a better keyboard for the Mac."
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.060]   He's always been a Mac fanatic.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:17.180]   They've been specializing in keyboards designed to work properly with a Macintosh.
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.180]   No drivers or anything.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:23.540]   You plug it in and it works exactly as you'd expect it with the fan key and everything.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.880]   They said they've purposely focused on making products Apple doesn't offer because they
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.720]   want to give you more choices.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.400]   You know, you get a keyboard with your Mac but maybe you'd like something a little better,
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.160]   backlit wireless, for instance.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.880]   Beautifully designed to look just like they belong to the Mac.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.560]   There's a programmable you want Ergo.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.000]   You don't like, maybe you have Carpal Tunnel.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.600]   Lisa really likes the Ergo keyboards because she's had surgery on one wrist for Carpal
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.120]   Tunnel and tilting those risks isn't healthy but leaving them at a natural angle, the split
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:59.540]   Ergo keyboard has a beautiful spacious palm rest made of that gel, the memory gel so
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.700]   it's just comfortable as heck.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:02.700]   They've got them in wired.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:03.860]   They've got them in wireless.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:04.940]   They've got ergonomic.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:05.940]   They have backlighting.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:09.020]   They've got a complete range of keyboards for you to choose from.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.460]   The function keys work exactly as you'd expect.
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.940]   No loss of functionality.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.220]   Nothing new to learn.
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.420]   It works right out of the box.
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:19.500]   The best seller though is that wired aluminum keyboard I showed you.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.680]   By the way, it even comes in gold if you happen to like gold.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   I do.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.200]   It's a worthy successor to Apple's.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.400]   You'll be very happy with it.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.780]   Oh, I should mention one other feature I really like because it's wired.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:36.420]   It has two USB ports on either side, one for your mouse and one for let's say a USB
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.420]   key or whatever.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.420]   That's really great.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:42.960]   And since I'm a lefty, I love it that there's a USB port on the left as well as on the right.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.900]   That's a huge help for me.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.580]   So I don't have to make the mouse cord go all the way around.
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.340]   If you've got a PC though, don't forget.
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.580]   Mattias has a keyboard for you too.
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.340]   Some of the best PC keyboards I've ever used.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:59.420]   And I really love if you have multiple computers, the multi-point pairing and the ability to
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:04.100]   switch the keyboard to up to four different devices right there is great.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.300]   Their tech support comes right out of their offices in Aurora, Canada.
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.820]   I think that's important.
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:12.580]   When it comes to tech support, I want Canadians.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.100]   I like how they are.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.300]   Janet and Carmella and the whole gang there, they're friendly, they're nice.
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.180]   They'll answer any questions you have.
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.180]   So don't hesitate.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.180]   Go over to the website.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:27.100]   It's Mattias.ca, M-A-T-I-A-S, Mattias.ca/MacBreak.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.860]   Check out the Mattias keyboards.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.260]   They're very affordable.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.820]   Find something that fits your style, fits your budget.
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.820]   And I know you'll be happy.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:36.580]   I've talked to a lot of people who've upgraded to Mattias.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:41.180]   M-A-T-I-A-S.ca/MacBreak.
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:44.940]   Mattias.ca/MacBreak.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:46.580]   You're going to love your Mattias keyboard.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.580]   I know I do.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.580]   It's what I use here.
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.300]   It's what I use the office.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:54.340]   I don't have the clickety one here because I don't want anybody to know that I'm typing
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:55.940]   in Google searches.
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:01.700]   But I do have the clicky one at home because I really like a big, deep, long travel keyboard
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.020]   with a nice, solid click on it.
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.020]   You get your choice.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:08.020]   Mattias.ca/MacBreak.
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.460]   All right.
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:15.180]   Speaking of keyboards, the MacBook Air is back, baby.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.980]   So excited.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:20.420]   Mine comes on the-- I guess next week on the 25th.
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.540]   No, no, that's the iPad comes to the 25th.
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.460]   Mine comes next month.
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.020]   I have to admit this is the first one where I looked at the price of it and I looked at
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.980]   the price of the iPad and I was like, "Ahh."
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:30.980]   You know, like if you're driving it--
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:31.980]   You're prices right, though, right?
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:32.980]   9.99?
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:33.980]   That's right.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:40.060]   But I'm just kind of like the more limited horsepower than the Pro, I was kind of like,
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:41.060]   "I don't."
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.060]   Like it'd be really--
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.060]   So that's my question.
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:47.500]   It's really hard between the iPad and the Air.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.500]   Just look at that.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.500]   You just have to really think about what you're saying.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.500]   It renuses.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:52.500]   Look at the keyboard.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.500]   Just look at that keyboard.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.500]   Oh, you got goals, isn't it?
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:01.820]   I have never felt so acknowledged and loved by Apple as saying, "Okay, Andy, we can't admit
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:05.860]   that we've been listening to you about having a trackpad for the iPad.
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:09.740]   We can't admit that the keyboard, like you said, was a failure from the start, but can
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:12.260]   we make it up to you by at least correcting these errors?
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:15.100]   I feel acknowledged and loved as all of us."
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.620]   You are indeed.
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.900]   9.99 is a big price point.
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:22.900]   That's a $200 drop from last year, last model, right, the 2018 model.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:24.240]   8.99 education.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.980]   I think that's a really important price point to hit an education.
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:35.820]   To your point, though, Alex, it is a Y processor, not a U processor, so it's not a super powerful
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:36.820]   process.
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:37.820]   What do you think, Renee?
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:38.820]   Has it feel?
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:39.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:42.900]   If you want performance, you're going to want the MacBook Pro, and you're probably going
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:48.060]   to want to wait until the new 13/14-inch MacBook Pro comes out, because those will use 10th
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.300]   generation U-class Intel processors.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.300]   This is 10th generation.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.980]   Intel is not back on their roadmap.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:59.540]   There are about two laps, three laps behind, but they're starting to actually run again.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:02.540]   This is on their 10nm process, finally.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.340]   It's not longer on the 14nm Intel isolate.
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:07.540]   That means better battery life, lower heat, right?
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:08.540]   Yes.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:13.420]   People are still on YouTube complaining about throttling if you get the i7 version, but
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:18.060]   I will humbly submit that that's a 2% of MacBook Air buyers problem.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.100]   Should you not get the i7?
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.500]   Should you get the i5?
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:26.340]   No, I mean, like, with all the voice, you didn't have a choice this time.
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.980]   Well, the last time the differences between the various SKUs was not something that Apple
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:30.980]   was interested in.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:34.140]   It was the right word.
[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:37.420]   Condoning, it wasn't a big difference between the chip.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:41.700]   This year there's a big difference because they go quad core and that's two additional
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.700]   cores.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:46.460]   It was really like the old one was Intel like, "Okay, this is not a very good version of
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.460]   the main chips.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.580]   We'll just clip this and ship it as my three."
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.940]   And Apple was like, "No thanks."
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:53.500]   No, we'll just use the i5.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.500]   I would either condone you, nor do I judge you.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:00.900]   I simply accept you into the product line as you are.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:05.620]   The one thing that's, for a lot of people testing these things is downloading Geekbench,
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.140]   pressing a button and saying, "Oh!
[01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:08.140]   Oh!
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:09.140]   Oh!
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:10.140]   Oh!
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.140]   Oh!
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.140]   Oh!
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:13.140]   Oh!
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:14.140]   Oh!
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.140]   Oh!
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:16.140]   Oh!
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:19.140]   And they have no idea what thermal throttling is or what workloads are or what's bursty and
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:22.740]   what's sustained because it doesn't work that way.
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:29.140]   So instead of loading just a bunch of different Chrome tabs or I decided to run 4K, I want
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:33.140]   to peg it the same way I run Pokemon Go on phones to see what they do at their absolute
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:34.140]   worst.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.140]   I run 4K raw light footage and I converted it to ProRes and I just let it run.
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:41.340]   It took 2.5 hours for 15 minutes, which is like 5 times slower than the i9 in my MacBook
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.340]   Pro.
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:46.740]   So if you're doing events and you want to get that video up right away, you do not want
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:47.820]   this laptop.
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:51.980]   But if you're doing like your vacation footage or you're doing like some music, if you're
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:55.740]   using a MacBook Air in the way that it's intended to be used, then these are great.
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:58.780]   I would recommend the i5 because I never recommend the i3.
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.100]   I just tried not to.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:04.940]   And the i7 is probably wasted on people who don't need, who don't have super high bursty
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:09.300]   workloads like some of the developers will have that might benefit from not very long
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:12.580]   sustained but at least very short sustained peak performance.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:13.580]   That'll be fine.
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.460]   But I think for most people the i5 is really the sweet spot and that's the price of the
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:20.700]   old of the discounted last previous model, 1099.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.820]   So it's a pretty good update.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.500]   I'm happy that is a magic price point.
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:31.980]   It is because I knew when I worked on the board at a one to one school, it was a high
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.300]   school that provided a laptop to all incoming freshmen.
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:39.740]   As soon as the MacBook went over on 999, they had to go to Windows.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:41.300]   That's something about that price point.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.540]   They just don't want to go over a thousand bucks.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.980]   And they all start that way.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:48.100]   They're all super expensive when they first come out and then Apple drops a price after
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:49.260]   a couple of years.
[01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:53.780]   And this is the perfect student laptop, I would say, right?
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:55.420]   Fixed keyboard, fixed performance.
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:58.300]   I mean, those are the some of the big ticket items right there.
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.140]   And that's fixed price.
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:04.860]   And according to iMore, it'll work with the pro display XDR if you want to spend another
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:05.860]   five or $6,000.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:06.860]   Why not?
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:13.860]   I mean, I make the MacBook an accessory for the screen or an accessory for the stand.
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:18.020]   It's a way of showcasing super compressed display, which is a technology that's in these
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:19.020]   chipsets.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.340]   So it's using Intel Iris Plus and it can do super compressed display.
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:24.820]   So that's just a way of highlighting that.
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:30.060]   So yeah, I mean, I don't know why I just love the MacBook Air.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:31.860]   Honestly, I love the MacBook.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:35.700]   I love the really small form factor, but I just can't use those keyboards.
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:39.700]   So a MacBook Air with a good keyboard or a decent, it's not good.
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.700]   Two USB-C decent.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.700]   Two USB-C ports.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:42.700]   One on either side.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:43.700]   That's better than one.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:44.700]   No, no.
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:45.700]   On either side.
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:46.700]   They're both on the same side.
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.140]   The headphone jack is on the other side.
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:52.380]   It's just cheaper and easier to make a bus that has two ports on one side rather than two
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:55.180]   buses that have them separated on either side.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.180]   That's okay.
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:19:01.340]   So the Hyperdrive dongle has two USB-C's, right?
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.980]   Laurie, you're the one who told me to buy it.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:04.540]   So that's fine.
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.980]   It's slate gray, not gold.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:06.980]   I'm a little bummed.
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.540]   It's not going to match.
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:09.540]   Okay.
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:10.540]   So which one did you get?
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.540]   What model?
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.540]   How much?
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.020]   I did exactly what Renee said not to do.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.660]   I got the i7.
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:17.300]   16 gigs is enough.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.420]   I wish I could put more Ram in it.
[01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:24.260]   And I really couldn't bring myself to buy all that extra hard drive space.
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.900]   So I think I did 512.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:26.900]   Which is enough.
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.900]   It's enough.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:28.900]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:29.900]   It's the perfect program.
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:31.460]   I think that's it.
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:36.540]   And that's kind of the point with the iPad Air is it's the MacBook for everybody.
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:42.540]   It's the one that we're supposed to, you know, the people who aren't out there trying to,
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:46.700]   you know, process massive amounts of video, they get the MacBook Air.
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.140]   Like that's like 90% of us.
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.380]   I want something light.
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.540]   I can carry it around.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.780]   I could put it on my lap.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.740]   I could surf the net, answer my email.
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:00.940]   Especially if you're, if you also have a desktop computer.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:05.140]   You definitely don't need something like a MacBook Pro if you also have some iMac or
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.540]   iMac Pro or Mac Pro.
[01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:10.780]   So it's the perfect computer for most people.
[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:12.780]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:17.100]   Also because it's no joke that the iPad Pro is one of the most powerful computers that
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.100]   Apple makes, particularly that it's at a price point.
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:25.980]   But nonetheless, the simple fact that the MacBook Air runs a conventional desktop operating
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:32.740]   system with a conventional for Apple anyway, a relationship between data and files and
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:38.460]   apps makes it, if you can only afford one computer, which I think defines a lot of people, that
[01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:40.820]   means that that is going to be your go to device.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:44.940]   That as much as you might admire the iPad Pro, as much as you might lust after it, it's
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:51.300]   going to cause enough headaches even in 2020 that it's still, the conservative choice is
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:57.340]   still going to be to buy a $1,000 laptop, even opposed to a $900 iPad Pro.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:01.620]   So I think it's very, very important that Apple still make sure that they can compete
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:07.180]   at that level because the people who can't afford a $2,000 MacBook today are the people
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:12.380]   who are going to be able to afford a $10,000 desktop Mac Pro in five years.
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:16.300]   You've got to make sure that you define their tastes so that they're not willing to accept
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.940]   anything less than a Mac in the future.
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:23.580]   And I think that this is a really great example of Apple doing this well, unlike when they
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:28.340]   switched to the Mac Book Pro and took away all of the things that we liked out of it,
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:30.780]   where they could have just taken half at one time.
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.620]   You could have just put USB-C on one half and got everybody started and then take away
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:38.500]   our Mac safe and all of our other things the next time you round.
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.580]   It could have been just, or let us keep it for a while.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:46.740]   Instead, we're seeing this thing where the, we're seeing the iPad Pro come up to speed
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:50.620]   and we're seeing all the things slowly be added to it, but we still have a choice to
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:53.660]   get a MacBook Air.
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:56.460]   And so I think that leaving people with that choice and not forcing them over the cliff
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:01.140]   into something that you think is progress is definitely the right way to go here.
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:04.940]   Yeah, it appears that they made a tactical error by removing all the things that we like
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:06.540]   from the MacBook Pro.
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:14.060]   They did keep a hands on those and that color screen instead of going to a small twist black
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:20.140]   and like, but they figured out how to, they really figured out a step on as many rakes
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.660]   in as short a time as possible with one release.
[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:27.860]   I mean, it's funny because I just love, you know, I love my MacBook Pro and I think that
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:33.780]   part of the reason that I don't love it anymore is because I just felt like they really screwed
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:34.780]   it up.
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:38.140]   Like, and I just, did you get the 16 inch, the new one?
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:39.420]   Now I've used the 16 inch.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.860]   I haven't bought it, you know, like I don't, I just use my iMac and thing.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:46.500]   I just, I'm just like, I, I need it when I need it, I have access to them when I need
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.500]   them for, for jobs.
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:51.940]   So if I need that, I can do it, but I've got a fast iMac and I, and I just, you know,
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.100]   the thing is, is that it's like all these dongles and it's, it's all these bits and
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.460]   pieces and, and I'm just, and I, they took away my mags.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.780]   I literally just don't feel safe.
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.180]   I don't want something sticking out.
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:04.700]   Like I want something that the mag safe was like this thing that I knew that if something
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.300]   popped on it, it would pop out.
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.300]   And I know that there are people all, every time I mention this on Macbreak, I get a whole
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:14.420]   bunch of tweets that say, Hey, this company has this little thing, but it's still like
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:18.460]   this little nub and I travel all over the place and I throw my, my computer into my
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.580]   backpack and I don't want it to bend.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:21.580]   Right.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:24.300]   Because as soon as it bends, it's over, you know, and, and so, and I'm afraid that that
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.740]   little nub is going to get pulled the wrong way.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:32.420]   And, and it is, and I just, you know, I haven't, you know, I have plenty of power with other
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:35.540]   computers at home and I haven't needed to travel as much as I used to.
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:40.300]   And so I just didn't bother because it's just, I think it's, I didn't, I'm still frustrated.
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:41.980]   I'm still bitter.
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:45.300]   Four years later, I'm just like, screw those guys.
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:48.180]   And nobody, nobody can be happy.
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:50.700]   I'm a Macbreak weekly with their Macs.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.380]   Everybody was complaining about the keyboard and the keyboard is getting fixed.
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.580]   And now there's a new thing that's popping up.
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.540]   That's just, it's not new.
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:00.740]   I, it's just a lot of us that have complained about the mags.
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:02.900]   Wait, I just want to point out the mags.
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:08.860]   They've complained is day one, day one, you know, like it was that, that, you know, like
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:13.020]   there's a lot of people who are who are road warriors that was like, they took away what?
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:18.260]   Like the best differentiator other than the operating system of that, of the computer
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:19.260]   is the mags.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.260]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.260]   And they took that.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:25.900]   So are you like, it's like literally you won't buy a new Mac book until they put back in
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.380]   a mag safe or is it just like, no, I just thought you were in this sort of middle ground
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.020]   where you just don't need the new ones.
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:35.980]   So you're not going to get a new one right now because you're kind of hoping though.
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.860]   No, I'm not expecting it to get it back.
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.100]   I'm just not in a rush to do it.
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.100]   Like I don't need it right now.
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.100]   I have my laptop.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:42.740]   That's what I needed to do.
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:47.700]   I don't, when I do heavy lifting, I do, I use my iMac when I do really heavy lifting.
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:52.660]   I have some Linux and PC boxes, you know, and I'm, I'm probably going to end up getting
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:53.660]   a Mac Pro.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:57.620]   It's just that my laptop, the other thing that happened was is that I let my laptop go
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:59.940]   long and now I use my iPad.
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.860]   When I go out, I take my iPad out.
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.860]   Like I don't take my unless there's something like, unless I think there's some app that
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:09.660]   I need, you know, so if I'm on the road and I'm going to need to do something in Photoshop
[01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:13.180]   or I'm going to need to do something in Final Cut, I'm going to take my laptop and it's
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.180]   fine.
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:15.180]   Like it does what it needs to do.
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.180]   I don't, I'm not in a rush.
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:18.540]   I understand what it can do and what it can't do.
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:23.140]   I can do what it does what it needs to do when I need needs to do something faster.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:24.420]   I do it at home.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:28.980]   And when I need, when I'm most days, 99% of the time when I walk out the door, I just
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.100]   have my iPad, you know, and I don't need, I don't need the computer anymore.
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:36.340]   And so, and I think that part of it, and so it just hasn't fit a new, you know, expending
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:41.180]   money on a new, you know, on a new, new laptop.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:45.020]   Just hasn't, hasn't been something I needed to do since, since I came out.
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:48.500]   It really, it really does kind of change the geometry of these decisions.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:54.580]   I cut, I was a devoted daily iPad Pro user even with, even when I had to, every time
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:58.500]   I went to the coffee shop or whether I was going to New York for a couple of days in
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:02.820]   my business, every time I'd have to, okay, I got my little easel unfold that.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:05.540]   I've got my iPad, put that up, turn it on.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.900]   I got my keyboard, put that, turn that on, make sure that's paired.
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.060]   Even like day, I would still love it day after day after day.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:15.500]   But as soon as I used the Pixelbook for the first time, the Google Pixelbook, I didn't
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.420]   like the op, I didn't like Chrome OS nearly as much as I liked iPad.
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:20.980]   It was certainly didn't like the apps nearly as much.
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:25.140]   But the simple idea of having a device that cost about is actually a little bit less and
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.540]   also was just as compact.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:32.340]   But I could just simply put it on the desk, lift the lid and I've got a working machine
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:37.380]   with a, with a trackpad that I could also like fold, fold around again and use just as
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:38.860]   an easel.
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.500]   That kind of, that trumped all that other software stuff.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:46.780]   But now the ability to, it really does change the calculus now that I can have that kind
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:52.140]   of usability with what I consider best in class, the productivity apps, not just mobile
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:54.820]   apps, productivity apps on this thing.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:58.700]   But it does go to show that it's hard for Apple to make everybody happy.
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:04.700]   And as much as I complain about the things that are important to me, because you, hopefully
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:09.060]   a year or two from now, Ray and I will stop having a discussion about how, oh well, you
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:12.900]   know, I use, I use the, I use that, that, that flat keyboard and I love it.
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.980]   And I have to say, well, I can't even use it all.
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:19.340]   The same, the same conversations that you and I have, Alex are about MagSafe because
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:24.660]   the best thing to ever happen to me is when like, I actually like shift in my chair a
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:28.580]   little and then not have to reach down to the floor, pick up the MagSafe connector that
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.740]   popped out simply because I shifted in my chair and plug it back in again.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:36.020]   And I know you have great reasons for wanting the MagSafe, including like not destroying
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:41.100]   your $2000 notebook, but it's like the amount of the amount of like psychiatrist bills I
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:46.100]   have had to pay dealing with my anger issues of not being able to move this damn thing
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:47.500]   without that thing popping out.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.580]   I think I'd be at least $100 maybe ahead.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:54.900]   I put my laptop on my lap cross like it would pop MagSafe off every time.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:58.380]   So apparently Alex never puts his laptop in his lap.
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:27:59.380]   That's the problem.
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:00.380]   I don't.
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.380]   It's not making money when it's in his lap.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:03.380]   It's only making money when it's on a desk.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:10.100]   Well, I think that I went through probably two or three laptops where not through them,
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.900]   but I had to have them repaired or I ended up just buying another one because the power
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:16.140]   supply, someone tripped over it.
[01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:20.340]   You know, like in production, you've got your power supply somewhere in a back room and
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:23.420]   there's poorly lit and people trip over things all the time.
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:29.300]   And so I just have a lot of scar tissue where it comes to my power being pulled out of my
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:30.660]   computer when I didn't expect to.
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.620]   And it being bent and you're in production and you can't charge it.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:37.460]   And so and literally this is the first time.
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:44.340]   I bought almost every laptop that Apple has made new like within a month after they released
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:48.660]   it unless it was back ordered for 15 years.
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:54.420]   Honestly, this is where as Mac OS users, you're at a disadvantage because it's only Apple
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:57.420]   that makes this hardware, they have to make choices.
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:00.380]   They can't make two, one with a MagSafe one without.
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:01.620]   They're never going to do that.
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.860]   So they're going to go with the largest, you know, the biggest audience or whatever criteria
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:08.060]   they use in the PC world.
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:11.700]   You know, there's all kinds of form factors to choose from.
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.340]   Yeah, and I'll eventually get a new one.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:15.340]   Mine is dying.
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.780]   So right now it's a switch of control.
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:22.660]   There's nothing like a MagSafe in the PC world as far as I know, but I don't think anybody
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:23.660]   makes it like that anymore.
[01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:26.540]   I feel like if they're not going to use it anymore, they just open source it.
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:30.380]   Like just give it a little like let's go to the pattern, let everybody use it because,
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:34.420]   you know, and then they'll see MagSafe on every computer except for theirs and then they'll
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.140]   feel really small.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:43.260]   It's only you, Alex.
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:48.340]   And then the poor Mac mini, which in all of this discussion, nobody ever mentions there's
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:49.340]   an updated Mac mini.
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:50.340]   And you say about it?
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:54.340]   I mean, I was really hoping they would update the processor.
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.340]   More room.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:58.060]   Yeah, but it's still eighth generation silicon.
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:29:59.220]   And that's I think it's exciting.
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:02.380]   Yeah, it shows their commitment, right?
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:06.060]   No, no, I think that if they updated the silicon, it was show their commitment.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.100]   Oh, well, then why did they release an updated Mac mini?
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.860]   Just I think because of price of storage has gone down to the point where they can put
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:14.860]   a much better baseline storage in it.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:16.820]   And that's that's good for the customer.
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:20.660]   And I don't know who's clamoring for this, but I think they were so long between updates
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:24.020]   last time that just to get back some good faith they should be putting.
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.620]   They should always make sure it has the latest.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:26.620]   That's what I mean.
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:27.620]   They do that for all their computers.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.620]   It's good faith.
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:31.140]   It's a good faith update.
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:34.100]   Just I don't know it's comparing apples to oranges.
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:40.140]   Can you I mean, people are saying all the new iPad Pro is faster than the MacBook Air.
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:42.340]   Can you compare them?
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:43.340]   Not really.
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:44.340]   They do different.
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:45.340]   I mean, Renee, you can compare them.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:46.340]   You you literally have them both.
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.340]   What do you think?
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:50.900]   I mean, Mac OS is bound to Intel.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:56.100]   Well, they like if there was a mythical computer that ran Mac OS on arm or, you know, a clamshell
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:59.300]   iOS device, I think it would blow into a lot of the water.
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:03.180]   Apple has not missed a year when it's come to when it's come to their Silicon Road map
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:07.060]   and it tells one like watch lost story three four years already.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:11.300]   So they're just way ahead when it comes to ultra mobile silicon.
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.820]   That would that would depend though.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:17.860]   There is such a thing is appropriate for your workflow and it's possible that the limitations
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:22.340]   of iOS compared to another desktop OS would be big enough.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:27.100]   There'd be enough pains in the butts to say that whatever you gain in CPU performance
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:30.020]   and system performance, you lose in terms of simple convenience.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:34.420]   So it's hard to it's like you said earlier, like people do benchmarks and they say, Oh,
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:38.340]   well, we sent this to an independent lab and we've proven that this number is higher than
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:41.060]   this other number therefore, but you can't do that.
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:45.220]   It really takes a couple of weeks of hands on before you realize that here is what is
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:48.980]   slowing me down or here's something that used to be a big pain to the neck that no longer
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:51.940]   have to deal with and that alone is making this worthy of the price.
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:52.940]   Totally fair.
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:56.380]   I just I was just imagining a beautiful, mythical world where you had your choice.
[01:31:56.380 --> 01:32:00.580]   But if you look at them now, there's a T2 chip in here and for years, Apple has had to
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:04.340]   route some of the what they what some of what they do is they have a performance controller
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:08.420]   that takes a bunch of stuff that Intel still can't do and routes it to the T2 chip instead.
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:11.460]   For example, like H.265 rendering and some of the accelerator.
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:14.940]   So you're getting an arm co-processor in this and it's doing faster than any Intel
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:15.940]   can do on its own.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:19.420]   It's just not doing all the x86 compatible stuff.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:24.020]   Plus I wish I wish my Macbook had as good a cameras than the way I pet pro.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.660]   Or at least they do.
[01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:27.460]   It's basically a potato right now.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.460]   That's a good point.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:33.740]   They have they really left those eyesight cameras to have twists in the bottom.
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.420]   We had a lot of discussions about this on Twitter.
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:40.100]   I think a couple of us were going back and forth about this and I I just feel like this
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:44.540]   gets back into the opposite direction that I would normally go, which is that I don't
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:50.940]   think that they should move the price of the skew up to support what a very small percentage
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:54.940]   of people want that most people don't notice.
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:59.380]   I mean, I can tell you because we have processed and we do remote events, right?
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:01.060]   What are we called centerless events?
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:06.860]   We process four to four to 5000 people in the last decade and most people don't notice
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:10.820]   that they don't have anything that's worth looking at and this is every laptop.
[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.100]   So most people don't care.
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:15.140]   Most people don't know the people who do buy an external one.
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:19.540]   They buy a stream cam or they buy a lot of a C920 or whatever they're going to buy in
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.980]   those, you know, or a higher end piece.
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:26.660]   And I think that you externalize that cost and let the people who care by it and put
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:28.420]   something in that's adequate.
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:34.900]   We're seeing a lot of bad Skype videos on the news channels this week.
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:36.180]   I mean, you know what?
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:37.180]   You know, one of the problems.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:42.860]   The problem is that I have I had to buy a bunch of, you know, we have we had some events coming
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:49.340]   up and I have to buy a bunch of webcams, all of the C920 is 922 is a stream cam.
[01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:50.340]   You can't get it.
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:51.340]   It sold out April everywhere.
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:53.340]   Not a single place.
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:54.340]   It's not that they're like that.
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:56.180]   It's that Amazon is prioritizing essentials.
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:58.060]   No, no, no, it's they're really gone.
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:33:59.820]   Even on Logitech or not.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:02.140]   They're, yeah, they're out of stock.
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:05.700]   We can't get things like headsets either on Amazon because yeah.
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:09.260]   So all the things that are good, it's because everyone who cared bought them really fast
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:10.780]   because they were like, Oh my gosh, I got to do this.
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:12.580]   And then everyone else is like, Oh, no, I can't.
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:13.580]   I don't know how to do that.
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:17.980]   And you know, it's so the, so you're saying it's the work at home movement that sold these
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:22.420]   things out that like jumped on and said, Oh, I know what I need.
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.820]   I think that there's two problems.
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:25.740]   One problem is that they're all made in China.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:26.740]   Right.
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:31.740]   And so there's supply chain issues that are then hammered by incredible demand spikes,
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:35.220]   you know, because the only the only general.
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:36.220]   The most important.
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.980]   But 4,000 of them and wipe them out.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:40.980]   That's well.
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.820]   I wouldn't be surprised because I mean, I don't think that there's, there's not a lot of competition
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:46.340]   right now between Logitech and everybody else.
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:50.700]   I mean, the other cameras are just, they're a little bit better than your laptop and all
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:54.900]   the Logitech ones when the 920 to 922, the stream cam and the Brio are the, are the four
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:57.380]   that if you care, that's what you buy as far as as a one.
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:01.660]   Or you use a point and shoot or a, I mean, there are, you know, right?
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:05.540]   I think it's like for an average person, but for an average person who wants to do that.
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:08.540]   I mean, what I'm saying though, somebody call me on the radio show yesterday said, how do
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:11.700]   I use my point and shoot for a web?
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:13.620]   I got asked how to use an iPhone for a web game.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:16.700]   Like I think it's like, this is the iPhone company and it's like, like it's like back
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.380]   when the max had terrible speakers.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.940]   You're the iTunes company.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:23.020]   Like you, and I know when the max get true depth, this will be a fixed problem because
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:25.700]   the true depth RGB camera is just better than this.
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.660]   And I know the lids are super, I don't care.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:30.580]   Like Apple should never have a bad camera.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:33.700]   I just don't think it's acceptable and you shouldn't have to buy an external one.
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:38.940]   Can you, if you connect your iPhone, I know a quick time, we showed this today on iOS today,
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:41.380]   quick time will pick up the iPhone as a camera.
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.100]   Will Skype, can you, can you use your iPhone?
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:44.100]   I handed it off to Alex.
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:47.860]   I asked him if you could use the HDMI out into an HDMI capture and then route it back into
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.340]   I think that's such a clue.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:50.980]   I was like, I better test that.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:54.460]   Before I responded to that, I was like, I'm going to think about that.
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:57.980]   Just connecting his lightning to his computer.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:02.100]   And then at least quick time, A is able to see the iPhone as a camera.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:03.100]   I don't think so.
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:07.420]   The question also is, when we're talking on Skype, we also have to deal with audio.
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:11.060]   So unless you're taking the audio from your phone, you're going to have an issue where
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:12.980]   the sync is dramatically different.
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:14.380]   That's normal anyway.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.620]   So it's going to be a big camera.
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:17.620]   It's a mess.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.660]   Yeah, fix the potato camera.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.660]   We all agree on that.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.940]   So for Alex, who just wants the max?
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.260]   He's like, make fries.
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.260]   Make fries, kids.
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:28.260]   I thought I had one.
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:29.260]   I thought I had one.
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:33.580]   And said, I logged into the chat room just to say, I agree with Alex.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:34.580]   Okay, good.
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.140]   You got some of the amazing from home now.
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:41.540]   And like FaceTime is built in and where this is the only human connection we have and we
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:42.780]   should look good to each other.
[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:43.780]   Yes, I agree.
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:44.780]   I agree.
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:45.780]   No, I'm not disagreeing that you should look good.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:48.340]   I just think that if you really, if you care about looking good, you should buy a real
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:49.340]   camera.
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:50.340]   You know, magic volcano.
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:56.460]   Well, but they put a Ray Mike's in the Mac book and now in the iPad so that you'd sound
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:59.500]   better, which I also think is not good.
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.020]   I'm wasting money.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:06.820]   Also, can I just be the first one to say what everyone is thinking that if all Alex had to
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:11.700]   live stream with was a potato, he would get at least 1080 HD and it would be perfect.
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.260]   I get the most out of that potato.
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.100]   It would be a really good potato.
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:18.580]   Give him a give him a red russet and he's good to go.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:19.580]   No excuses.
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:20.580]   Wow.
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:23.180]   This, you know, we didn't even mention COVID once in this show.
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.660]   I want to congratulate you.
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:27.420]   A couple of other Apple stories real quick.
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:32.020]   The afterburner card, which was made for the Mac Pro is now available as a standalone.
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:34.780]   Who would buy that besides Alex?
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:35.900]   Anyone using ProRes?
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:36.900]   ProRes.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:37.900]   What does it do?
[01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:38.900]   ProRes accelerator.
[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:40.100]   It accelerates ProRes rendering.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.100]   Okay.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:42.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:45.220]   So if you're exporting a big, a big, a big movie, it makes it a lot faster.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:49.060]   I'm not sure exactly what the X is, but it's, it's a lot.
[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:50.860]   New watch bands and iPhone cases.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:53.180]   Renee Richie, of course, cares a lot about that.
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:56.620]   Renee, do you have the watch band to show off?
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.620]   No, I switched.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:58.620]   I switched to the rally.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.620]   He switched it.
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:00.620]   It's very, very pretty.
[01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:01.620]   I like it.
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:02.620]   What is it?
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.260]   They have just one of the new colors.
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:05.260]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:06.260]   The new colors are all pretty.
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:07.780]   They have this one now for the Black Hermes as well.
[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:10.540]   Leo, if you've been dying for the, with Black Lugs.
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:11.540]   Pretty.
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:12.540]   Yeah.
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:13.540]   Very pretty.
[01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:14.540]   Yeah.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:19.020]   Micah Sergeant, always the fashion plate actually changed the lugs on one of his band because
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.420]   it didn't match the watch.
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:25.460]   And he wanted it, you know, you don't want a two-tone lug.
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:26.460]   That would be just the best.
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:28.300]   If I look like Micah, I would be doing that too.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:33.780]   If I was as good as Micah, I'd want my, I'd want my lugs to match my watch as well.
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:34.780]   Here, let's see.
[01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:36.980]   Let me look at Renee's article here.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.500]   I think I have it.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:40.540]   This is so confusing for me to do all of this.
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.540]   Here we go.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.780]   Pink.
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:47.100]   I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you the normal guy colors.
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:48.340]   Pink, yellow.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:53.020]   You got a blue with green and one with holes in it to get green.
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:55.260]   I have the light gray with orange one too.
[01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.460]   I don't have it with me, but it's very nice.
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:00.620]   And then I'm gonna give you the official apple colors.
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:04.100]   Cactus grapefruit and serf blue.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.100]   Oh yeah.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:06.940]   Oh, call it, call it pink guys.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:07.940]   It's pink.
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:11.940]   Pink is a, pink is a lovely color and you don't need to make excuses for it.
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.340]   It's not salmon.
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:14.340]   It's not, it's just pink.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.140]   Whoever saw pink cactus.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:17.140]   All right.
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:21.740]   Oh, some of those muskley and fuel bites in the desert.
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:22.740]   Oh boy.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.140]   Grapefruit, oh great.
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:25.140]   It's yellow.
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:26.140]   It's grapefruit.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.980]   I do like the soft leather band.
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:28.980]   What do they call those?
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.780]   I love those bands, the soft leather.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:31.780]   Leather loop.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:32.780]   Leather loop.
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:33.780]   Nobody does that.
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.780]   It's apples.
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:37.020]   They're like yoga pants for your wrist.
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.020]   It's amazing.
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.180]   Well, that's the, that's the stretch.
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.180]   Hook and loop ones.
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:42.180]   All right.
[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:44.860]   Nice, nice new bands.
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.860]   There's more.
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:48.500]   That's just like one picture of some of the colors.
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:54.260]   I think the loops, the nylon loop, I think there's a couple of varieties of the color
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:55.260]   on that one.
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:56.260]   Yeah.
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:59.820]   And I think the Nike band actually has a couple unique.
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:04.420]   If I remember, because I'm not a big fan of neon and most of their band colors are neon
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:07.620]   and they did put out a new color that didn't have neon.
[01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:11.020]   They have world indigo lime bloat.
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:12.700]   I'm sorry, blast.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.740]   That's the one we saw and hyper crimson Neptune green.
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:20.380]   There's also new modern buckles in get ready.
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:27.740]   Raspberry and deep sea blue and the new peacock leather loop.
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.500]   I'm guessing this a light baby blue.
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.500]   Yeah.
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.500]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.580]   And then there's some new as you pointed out, Renee.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:37.980]   Fancy leather, single tour and double tour.
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:38.980]   Yes.
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:39.980]   Orange prints.
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:44.380]   Swift leather and noir gala leather.
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:47.380]   Oh boy, it's a fashion business.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:48.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:49.380]   And this is a new spring line.
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:53.540]   And there's a lot, a lot, a bunch of those colors are also have been introduced into
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:54.780]   the iPhone case lineup.
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:58.700]   So if you really want to match, if you want to be on with your with your Apple.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:02.140]   I haven't heard that phrase in a while.
[01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:03.140]   Apple has.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:04.140]   Michael's honor.
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:05.140]   Yes.
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:07.420]   Even Mike and has used that anymore.
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:11.260]   Apple rolls out universal purchase support for Mac and iOS apps.
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:15.820]   So if you're a developer that's been wanting to sell one app for both the Mac and iOS, now
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:16.820]   you can do it.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.980]   Is anybody doing that yet?
[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:19.980]   Pee Cal crazy.
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.780]   I have seen just announced.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:22.780]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:23.780]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:24.780]   Brand new.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:30.900]   How's the supply chain Foxconn says they got enough workers now to meet seasonal demand
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:36.100]   at all major Chinese plants ahead of schedule.
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:37.100]   That's good.
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:41.140]   So the major bottleneck has been cleared up in that now they can actually get people moving
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.860]   and say get trucks moving from place to place.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:49.620]   Also they lifted like the most intense quarantine over the epicenter and boo had I think.
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:55.900]   So they also to be fair, the government has been sort of pressuring its ministers to try
[01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:59.380]   to get people back to work as soon as is humanly possible.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:03.740]   You know, as then she says, he says, you don't want the cure to be worse than the problem.
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:04.740]   God.
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:07.420]   No, that won't be horrible.
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:09.500]   They would be in human monsters.
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:12.660]   Like I'm glad we don't have we don't have people that in China or here.
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:13.660]   Thank goodness.
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:15.580]   Oh, wait, I haven't checked my news today.
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:17.100]   Are you making a joke about?
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:19.820]   I am Apple donates millions of masks.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:23.140]   That's good to health care pros in the US and Europe.
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:25.860]   What do they have these masks for?
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:27.340]   The car painting shop.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:28.900]   Where did they find these?
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:29.900]   Or did they?
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:30.900]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:31.900]   So are they courting them?
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:34.700]   Apparently, no, they had them for like for engineering.
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:35.700]   Instead, I don't know.
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:36.700]   They had some masks.
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:38.740]   They're coming out of the woodwork.
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:39.740]   Yeah, which is good.
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:42.180]   We just have thousands of them because they just need them for their jobs.
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:43.180]   Yeah.
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:46.740]   And remember, it is safety equipment for people who if the person who is painting your cars,
[01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:50.580]   the people who are just drawing blood, they need these things at different facilities.
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:52.700]   So there are a lot of them that are still being squirreled away.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.340]   And it's very, very brave of them to say that I'm not going to be able to do my job,
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:57.740]   but my job is in essentials.
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:02.100]   And I will just simply send this box of a thousand masks to someone who actually will
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:03.100]   use it to save lives.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:07.500]   So it's a very, very laudable act on their part.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:12.820]   And actually, as evidence that maybe the supply chain is easing up, they have eliminated their
[01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:16.100]   limits on the number of phones you can buy.
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:21.020]   So go buy more.
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:26.380]   They're donating to Italy and Silicon Valley to help out there.
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:34.500]   10% iTunes and App Store bonus as business and education app downloads, Jump 300% due
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.540]   to Corona virus.
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:41.980]   Apple books offering a stay at home collection of free read alongs for kids, cozy mysteries
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:43.660]   and audio books.
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:47.700]   Audible's doing the same thing, by the way, our sponsor.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:51.220]   And I guess we have covered the Apple news.
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:53.060]   Anything I missed.
[01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.860]   I think we focused on the new products.
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:57.260]   There was a lot.
[01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:02.980]   Apple TV plus is lowering its streaming quality along with YouTube and Netflix and others
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:07.860]   to keep networks in Europe from bogging down.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:08.860]   I imagine a lot of people.
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:10.860]   You too just set the default to 480p.
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:11.860]   Yeah, 480p.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:12.860]   That's way to get a few.
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:14.900]   Yeah, if you go there, you get 480p standard.
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:15.900]   Wow.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:18.700]   It's like we're going back in time.
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:23.340]   Did you see the Apple retail sign that is going up for auction?
[01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.340]   Ooh, it's so pretty.
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:28.340]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:33.420]   Yeah, so it's like a four foot by five foot retail sign that was put together in 1977,
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:36.580]   1978 according to the press release.
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:42.460]   And so it's not as though this was the original one infinite loop or bandly drive sign.
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:45.900]   It's just like a store made this and had it in front of the store in the late '70s.
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:51.420]   It looks very pretty, but $20,000 you can have something made for a lot less than that.
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:54.020]   And to fit that nice space over your armoire.
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:56.580]   Yeah, that seems a little expensive.
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:57.580]   It's pretty.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.580]   It's pretty though.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:01.580]   Well, it's the old stuff.
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:03.700]   In fact, I was just showing I have these are probably good.
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:06.540]   Maybe you can get $20,000 for your stickers.
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:07.540]   20 bucks.
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:08.540]   Anyway, it's the same.
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:12.300]   It's the same thing with the same typeface and everything.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:13.620]   Some fan have been saying.
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:14.620]   I think he worked at Apple.
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:18.580]   I think had been saving these all these years for me.
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:19.580]   Yep.
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:20.580]   Let's retirement.
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:25.940]   Yeah, right here in this sample of $20,000 with Apple stickers.
[01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:30.340]   See this is this is where you call us hoarders until you were the only one who has a set
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.420]   of original twiggy drives from a pull from a Lisa.
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:35.260]   In which case, oh, you're an archivist.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:39.140]   I'll give you $10,000 for those twig drives.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:40.140]   Let's take a break.
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:42.780]   We're going to get your picks in just a second, folks.
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:43.780]   Get ready.
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:44.780]   Line them up.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:47.740]   But first a word from LastPass.
[01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:53.460]   LastPass, of course, is the password manager we use and recommend and tell everybody in
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:55.340]   business and at home to use.
[01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:59.660]   They're the sponsors of our LastPass studios.
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:01.580]   They're the company that keeps me safe.
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:04.860]   I am a big fan, as you know, of LastPass.
[01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:09.900]   As you're preparing for your remote workforce, remember, you're sending employees home with
[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:11.660]   the keys to the kingdom.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:17.580]   The passwords to your bank accounts and your databases, to your websites, transitioning
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:23.900]   from a full work to home environment can be complicated.
[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:29.020]   LastPass is here to make the transition easier and most importantly, without decreasing
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:32.100]   security.
[01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:35.500]   Right now, massive problem with phishing attacks.
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:38.740]   The bad guys love taking advantage of disasters.
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:42.420]   It's a disaster-tunity for them.
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:51.140]   With those uptakes in phishing attacks with coronavirus subject matter, LastPass helps
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:56.660]   because they don't auto-fill passwords on suspicious websites.
[01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:59.780]   If your employees don't have the password, which in most cases, that's what you're going
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:04.380]   to want to do, they're never going to be able to give those credentials to some bad
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:06.340]   guy for any reason.
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:09.500]   They're not going to be fooled by a phishing attack.
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:14.740]   For remote employees who access the corporate VPN, LastPass has an additional layer of security
[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:19.500]   directly to your VPN through its biometric, multi-factor authentication.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.060]   It's more than just fingerprints.
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:23.500]   It's more than just face ID.
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:24.500]   There's geolocation.
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:25.500]   There's IP.
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:29.740]   There's all sorts of ways that you can completely control who has access to those vital assets,
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:30.740]   thanks to LastPass.
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:35.420]   And regardless of where or how your employees need access, LastPass ensures they have secure
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.380]   access to their work applications.
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:40.580]   With single sign-on, employees love that.
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:44.380]   It's a lot easier than a password and for you a lot more secure.
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:46.900]   And of course, the best password management in the biz.
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:49.220]   I've been using LastPass for 10 years.
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:56.740]   I trust LastPass so much because the LastPass vault, I consider my secure enclave for everything
[01:47:56.740 --> 01:47:59.700]   I do because only I can decrypt my LastPass vault.
[01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:02.660]   It's only decrypted on device.
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:04.940]   And the keys never go to LastPass.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:08.700]   No one except me has access to that master password.
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:10.140]   So I know I'm safe.
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:14.460]   That's why I put my passports in there, my driver's license, my social security number,
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:19.700]   my tax returns, anything I want to keep secure, I store in LastPass.
[01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:23.980]   LastPass offers offline mode for both password management and multi-factor.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:29.180]   So even if your employees are offsite and can't get online, they still can access those
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:31.020]   important resources.
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:33.460]   It's great for seamless collaboration.
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:37.080]   You create a LastPass shared folder or you share a password directly.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.220]   We have an ops folder.
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:39.900]   We have a business office folder.
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:44.500]   Makes it very easy for employees to securely share passwords across teams.
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:47.820]   There's intuitive admin and end-user experiences.
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:52.060]   Means you get up and running in minutes, but you don't give up complete secure control.
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:55.540]   Your IT department has over 100 policies they can enforce.
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:48:58.140]   We enforce, for instance, two-factor authentication.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:00.220]   Really important if you're letting that.
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:01.860]   Those computers go out of the office.
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:06.780]   You want to make sure that a bad guy who has access to that computer can't get into
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:12.460]   those special things because they'll also need the phone or the UBICE or any one of
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:15.740]   a number of second-factor authenticators.
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.740]   You're really in control.
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:18.300]   I'm just a big fan of LastPass.
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:19.700]   I think you know that.
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:22.140]   Increased security does not have to be more complex.
[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:25.820]   Start your journey today by visiting LastPass.com/twit.
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:28.780]   Find out how they can help you, especially now.
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:33.380]   When you're sending employees out of the office, you're sending them home, you don't want them
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:34.780]   to be any less secure.
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:37.540]   You don't want your office, your business to be any less secure.
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:39.180]   You want LastPass.

[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:46.940]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:51.820]   Ini-mini-mini-mo, let's start with Renee Ritchie in the left-hand corner to block.
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:54.220]   Oh, I got to turn on the mic.
[01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:57.700]   I don't know if this is a sign of our times or just the way that I feel, but I started
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:02.740]   going back to RSS, which I haven't used since Google Reader went away.
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:06.620]   And Brent Simmons has put out Net Newswire for iOS.
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:11.940]   Net Newswire 5 for iOS falling up on the fabulous Mac app that he put out.
[01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:14.380]   But it was so funny, Leo, and you'll appreciate this more than most.
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:18.220]   He says it's like podcasts, but for your news, which is such an ironic statement.
[01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:20.660]   It's a complete reverse, right?
[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:22.820]   Everything's old is backwards again.
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:27.620]   But there's just something great about it.
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:30.780]   You choose the news sources that you rely and depend on.
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:32.660]   And of course, I never want to be in a bubble.
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:36.860]   I want to have multiple opinions, but I don't want, like, Twitter is an endless fire hose
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:40.900]   and there could work Facebook where you have relatives who still believe the earth is shaped
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:43.060]   like a small pizza.
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:44.260]   It just doesn't matter.
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:46.140]   I get to pick exactly what I read.
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:50.220]   I pick varied sources that give me a lot of different, really informed, really educated
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:51.220]   opinions.
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:53.060]   They're all incredibly well laid out.
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:56.180]   They all sink between all of my devices.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:59.500]   They feel, in a way, like coming home.
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:04.420]   When Yoda pulls the X-Wing out of the swamp and you're just left with this beautiful
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:09.420]   starship that's giving you exactly what you need whenever you decide you need to go there.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:10.580]   It's not pushed on you.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:12.140]   It's not forced on you.
[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:15.380]   It's not a splattered all over you.
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:18.580]   It's just the news that you want to have in front of you.
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:21.900]   It's been incredibly valuable to me for the last week or so that I've been using it.
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:23.460]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:29.660]   You can export your, if you saved your Google News reader, OPML, you can export that out
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:31.980]   and save it and import it into a net newswire.
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:33.580]   It's the classic look.
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:36.500]   Brent, so it was a complicated story, right?
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:38.460]   He sold it to Blackpixle.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:44.540]   He sold it to the company that he worked for and then that company sold it to Blackpixle
[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:47.940]   and then backpixle went out of that business and he bought it back.
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:52.260]   It's just all Brent all the time now and it will sink with FeedBid and with Feedly and
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:53.580]   with all those services as well.
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:54.940]   So you've been using something else.
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:52:00.340]   If you want to use multiple other, whatever, like it's just, he's one of the pioneers in
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:01.340]   this industry.
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:02.900]   He's one of the nicest people in this industry.
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:06.620]   And I also think even though he doesn't, like he's doing all this as a side gig while
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:10.540]   he works it on me, I just, I want to support as much independent software as I can right
[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:11.540]   now as well.
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:12.540]   That's really great.
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:15.580]   I'm going to import my Feedly and I'll be ready to go.
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:17.060]   I think that's great.
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:18.060]   Thank you, Brent.
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:19.060]   Such a great company.
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:21.500]   Bringing back the classic net newswire.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:24.780]   Andy and Aco, your turn.
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:29.100]   You might have heard, you might not have heard that the Metropolitan Opera is one of many,
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:34.860]   many different arts organizations that decided to start streaming its back catalog for free.
[01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:39.100]   That's normally a four-pace sort of thing while people are sort of cooped up at home.
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:44.980]   I've waited until this week to, I think, to plug it because tonight, this week is Wagner
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:50.980]   Vique, the operas of Wagner, but you have to say Wagner, it's Wagner Vique.
[01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:54.300]   And we're recording on Tuesday.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:59.700]   You're probably too late to get the replay of Tristan and his solda.
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:04.860]   That was last night, but you are in time to see the entire ring cycle starting with
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:09.820]   those high engolds starting tonight with two of my favorites, Brent Turfel, who wears the
[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:15.180]   most base baritone that commands.
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:19.180]   He's definitely going to be the first to be served at Starbucks if the orders are back.
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:21.180]   Where is my latte?
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:25.500]   And you will immediately serve him because he has that wonderful voice.
[01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:29.860]   Also Stephanie Blythe is also one of the leads, another one of my big, big favorites.
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:30.860]   I don't know.
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:35.500]   It's not like I recognize most names of people and operas, but as soon as I see Brent Turfel
[01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:38.820]   is not Stephanie Blythe, it's like, okay, guess what?
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:43.020]   I know that I was planning on deciding not to go out tonight, but I'm specifically not
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:47.380]   going out tonight so that I can watch the ring cycle tonight tomorrow and the next day.
[01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:49.020]   I just go to medapra.org.
[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:50.540]   There's a link right from the front page.
[01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:55.180]   You can also watch it through the Medapra stream and HD apps for Apple TV and other
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:56.700]   streamers.
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:54:00.780]   And the streams will be up for 24 hours or maybe an hour or less than 24 hours.
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:06.620]   I think the streams go live at 730 and they're up until 630 p.m. Eastern time the next day.
[01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:10.540]   So if you miss out in the evening, you can still get it all day tomorrow.
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:11.540]   Nice.
[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:14.540]   I've never actually watched the ring cycle.
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:17.740]   I don't think I've even heard more than excerpts of the ring cycle.
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:19.260]   And this is going to be my there.
[01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:20.260]   There are captions.
[01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:23.100]   So you can actually read, you can read along in English.
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:27.660]   Also I've learned in opera like years ago that it is not considered cheating to read
[01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:30.420]   the libretto, like read the storyline before you watch it.
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:32.300]   That helps a lot.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:36.100]   But I hope that people if people are watching opera for the first time, they're used to
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:40.180]   like how it's presented in like comedies of the 30s and 40s and whatever.
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:45.260]   It's not like people dressed in like 300 year old costumes and spirit magic home.
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:49.780]   It's like some of the most amazing and innovative staging and productions you'll ever see.
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:50.780]   So give it a try.
[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:51.780]   You might like it.
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:53.300]   You might even annoy it.
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:56.260]   At worst, you might even just annoy the kids enough to leave the living room and leave
[01:54:56.260 --> 01:54:57.860]   the TV and the sofa for yourself.
[01:54:57.860 --> 01:54:59.700]   Either way, I think that's a win-win.
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:00.700]   Face choice.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:02.660]   A little opera.
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:08.340]   By the time you finish the ring cycle, everything will be back to normal.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:09.340]   Laurie Gill.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:12.580]   You're allowed to stop your to pause and go pee whenever you want.
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:16.780]   It's not like the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the theater.
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:17.780]   It's the other rings.
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:18.780]   Yes.
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:20.860]   Laurie Gill, your pick of the week.
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:25.380]   So I'm going to go against the grain and offer you up something that you have to spend
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:28.780]   money on, which I know is tough right now for people.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:32.780]   So I hope I don't make anybody spend money that they don't have.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:38.500]   But Moojo or Moojo MUJJO, I've never been able to figure out how to pronounce it, right?
[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:44.380]   They have added a new color to their leather wallet iPhone case lineup and it is called
[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:46.460]   Slate Green.
[01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:52.100]   And it is a really nice compliment to your midnight green iPhone.
[01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:54.620]   It's really beautiful.
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:57.140]   Thin case, not ultra thin, but it's a thin case.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:58.420]   It's covered in leather.
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:01.500]   It has one little pocket on the back for your credit cards.
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:09.580]   It's also already a little bit loose so that your card doesn't get stuck in there because
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:13.460]   it's too tight and you have to let it loosen up.
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:17.540]   It's got the suede interior.
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:19.060]   The buttons are not machined.
[01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:25.100]   They stick out a little so you don't have a nice machined button like you do with an
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:26.460]   Apple case.
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:30.660]   But otherwise, everything about it is pretty extraordinary.
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:37.660]   And I just wanted to show you when you get back to the color of my iPhone versus the
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:38.660]   color of the case.
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:40.260]   Look how nice that is.
[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:41.260]   Perfect.
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:42.260]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:43.660]   It's a really, really nice finish.
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:48.820]   So if you've, and that's for Micah, so make sure he sees that.
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:52.380]   If he's not already listening or watching right now, I think he's going to absolutely
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.380]   love that color.
[01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:54.380]   Moojo.
[01:56:54.380 --> 01:56:55.380]   Moojo.
[01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:58.580]   It's 43 pounds and 24 pence or whatever it is.
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:56:59.580]   I don't know.
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:00.580]   Something like $46.
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:01.580]   Sorry, $46.
[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:04.500]   41 euros and 24 pence.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:05.500]   Very nice.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:06.500]   Very nice.
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:08.500]   I like wallet cases actually.
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:10.300]   I'm kind of a fan.
[01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:13.860]   And it just, just the right size for your Apple card I noticed.
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:14.860]   Yes.
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:15.860]   Yeah, you like that.
[01:57:15.860 --> 01:57:17.260]   I did that on purpose by the way.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:22.340]   My Apple card has been sitting in a little special case for a couple of months now in
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:23.340]   my little case.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:24.820]   It's not going to get stained.
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:27.420]   I've been carrying a leather wallet for a long time.
[01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:28.420]   It's fine.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.420]   Yeah.
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:30.420]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:31.420]   Oh, what?
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:34.340]   I just got a text message from Micah.
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:35.340]   He's watching it.
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:36.340]   Thanks, Micah.
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:37.340]   Thank you, Micah.
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:42.540]   That's the host of iOS today and smart tech today and tech news weekly.
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:47.900]   And now Alex Lindsey from 090 Media.
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:49.420]   Something expensive, I'm sure.
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:50.820]   Oh, Alex, you're muted.
[01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:51.820]   You're muted.
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:52.820]   You're muted.
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:53.820]   You're muted.
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:54.820]   They're muted.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:55.820]   They're muted.
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:56.820]   They're muted.
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:57.820]   They're muted.
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:57:58.820]   They're muted.
[01:57:58.820 --> 01:57:59.820]   They're muted.
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:00.820]   Sorry.
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:01.820]   They're muted.
[01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:02.820]   I'm muted earlier.
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:03.820]   It's funny that I would talk.
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:04.820]   Yeah.
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:08.540]   So I, a lot of people have been asking about bits and pieces of how to improve their webcasts
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:11.180]   and their webinars and so on and so forth.
[01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:15.500]   And one of the things that I talk about a lot is the fact that you should wear some kind
[01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:19.900]   of, some way to block your audio, you know, headphones of some kind.
[01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:20.900]   Right.
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:23.660]   But you shouldn't put them over, over the years is not the best look.
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:24.660]   You mean like this?
[01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:25.660]   You don't like that?
[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:28.020]   Hey, you can do it because you're a radio guy.
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:30.020]   I'm a professional announcer.
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:31.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:32.740]   You got the radio look.
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:33.740]   It's all good.
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:38.740]   But, you know, but the, but a lot of times if, if, you know, you're trying to do it subtly,
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:43.380]   you should use headphones and it's really hard to use regular consumer headphones or
[01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:46.180]   consumer earpieces to do what you're doing.
[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:52.100]   So the, I thought I would share at least what the standard is in broadcast.
[01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:56.260]   If you feel like you need that, which is a company called Audioimplements.
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:02.060]   They're hidden in Wisconsin and they calling them, it may have gotten, it may be different
[01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:06.020]   now, but for the, we've probably bought a couple hundred of these over the last decade
[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:10.900]   where we, because we supply them to people who are on air and, and it's like calling
[01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:13.060]   like the CIA or something.
[01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:17.940]   They're just like, hello and you're like, I need a, I need a part 123, 127, one and they're
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:18.940]   like, do you need it two day?
[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:19.940]   And you're like, yes.
[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:20.940]   And they're like, okay.
[01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:26.380]   And it's like, it's like magic, but they, they're all business.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.780]   They deal mostly with broadcast.
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:31.300]   So that's why they don't do it a lot of PR and in the area that you would probably see.
[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:35.020]   But, but they are, you know, they're just the, the, what everybody uses.
[01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:36.300]   And so I'm wearing one right now.
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:37.300]   Let's see here.
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.300]   This is what I kind of use on it.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:39.300]   Oh, nice.
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:45.140]   So, so this is the, and what, what's interesting about it is is that the speaker element is
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:49.540]   actually, and I won't be able to hear you want to pull this out and hold on.
[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:52.700]   So this is the speaker element that comes out of the pool.
[01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:55.100]   I'll talk for a second and I'll put it back in.
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:58.580]   And so this, so this, this is, there's a whole bunch of different pieces to it.
[01:59:58.580 --> 02:00:02.460]   So when you pull it out, when you pull it apart, so you have, you can have a bunch of
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:05.660]   different kinds of cables that you might use, you know, for it.
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:10.260]   So they, they stereo and mono and designed to go into all kinds of other audios.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:13.140]   Then you have a speaker element that's, that's this piece here.
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:15.620]   So then you pop this guy in back in here.
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:19.500]   And then you, you might have a variety of these and a lot of broadcasters will have
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:24.380]   actually buy this and a lot of the broadcasters work with actually own their own version of
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:25.380]   this.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:26.460]   They just have this one part.
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:29.420]   And then we bring this other part in that way they don't have to share ears, you know,
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:30.340]   which is kind of gross.
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:32.540]   So, um, uh, let's see here.
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:36.380]   And then you have the weird guy Alex, you know, you know, how that weird guy Alex is,
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:37.380]   right?
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:38.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:40.220]   Well, oh, wait, can you hear us again?
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:46.420]   There's a whole, there's a whole, um, uh, theater that is done when you put one of these
[02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:49.580]   in someone's ear and they don't have the last piece, which is that I tell guys, you
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:52.820]   can't clean the earpiece before they get there or you can't replace it.
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:54.380]   We don't give them, we don't clean them.
[02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:59.020]   We, we throw them away, but, but the, but the little earpiece at the very end, you have
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:00.660]   to change it while they're there.
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:03.100]   Like, so they know, so they know it's fresh.
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:07.300]   Yeah, no, no, you're, you're communicating that, that I'm taking it out of, out of, out
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:09.460]   of something that's there and I'm putting it on.
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:15.180]   And so there's a whole process to how you, how you hand someone, um, uh, an IFP.
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:17.380]   And so anyway, so, but this is audio.
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:21.340]   Now there's, um, auto, auto makes another one that's a little less expensive.
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:24.260]   This is about 125 bucks, I think somewhere in that range.
[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:29.060]   Uh, auto makes one that's, uh, I think about 45 bucks, which we've used a lot of too.
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:32.180]   But if you're looking for like, you know, if you have someone that now that we're doing
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:35.700]   all these webinars that I just need to know what to get and I want it to be the audio,
[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:38.940]   you know, the industry standard, there's a lot of like sea level folks that want to
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:39.940]   know what that is.
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:41.020]   Well, this is the one standard.
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:43.500]   I don't use less than the industry standard.
[02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:47.140]   You know, you'd be surprised, you'd be surprised at how many people ask for that.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:50.140]   Like they just want to know what, what are, what are they using on CNN or what are they
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:52.540]   using on ABC or Fox or whatever?
[02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:56.300]   And this is, this is what just about all of them are, are using.
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.480]   So anyways, just, I thought it'd be interesting for people to at least know what it is.
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:04.800]   Well, I think mostly using a professionally audio, audio, audiologist molded ear pieces
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:05.800]   that.
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:06.800]   Right.
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:07.800]   But that goes on the very answer.
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:09.300]   That's, that's the generic earpiece.
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:13.260]   No, no, but this, that, this end piece, you, you actually, you, you should be able to,
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:14.860]   you, you send it, audio implants does that.
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:19.500]   So you put the little goo in your, I don't, I didn't do it with this one, but it's still
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:20.500]   the same.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:23.180]   The mechanism is audio implants.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:24.980]   The, the, the last earpiece can be yours.
[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:25.980]   They'll actually do for you.
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:26.980]   Yeah.
[02:02:26.980 --> 02:02:29.260]   It can be yours and, and, and they'll actually make that.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.860]   There's another advantage to that because I'm wearing mine now.
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:34.740]   No one can wear it because it does it made for my year.
[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:35.740]   Right.
[02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:36.740]   Right.
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:37.740]   Yeah.
[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:38.740]   Yeah.
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:40.100]   So, so they're, they, they, they produce those for you.
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:45.460]   If you get the mold, you can go to anybody who builds, um, yeah, your, your, audiologist
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:46.460]   will do it.
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:47.460]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:49.460]   audiologist will, will do the mold and then they'll send it to audio implements and they'll
[02:02:49.460 --> 02:02:50.460]   build that for you.
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:52.700]   They'll send you, I have a little, I, I, we get little boxes.
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:55.780]   You shame me into wearing my in ears.
[02:02:55.780 --> 02:03:01.120]   But if you're, you know, again, if you're serious, the, the big takeaway is do something
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:05.060]   with, you know, where your head, wearing headphones, because part of the problem is,
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:08.900]   is that the echo cancellation that's being used in an open speaker is actually taking
[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:10.460]   a bunch of stuff out of your audio.
[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:13.660]   You know, that, you know, so what it's doing is is that when you don't wear a headphone,
[02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:15.460]   you're not sending all your audio back.
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:19.500]   You're sending all your audio minus what it's hearing from the other side.
[02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:25.300]   And so we have a pretty clean sound because we're all using, uh, high headphones.
[02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:26.300]   And we wear headphones.
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:29.060]   And so that's a much cleaner sound, but so many people just turn it on.
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:32.700]   I want to talk and they just leave the speakers open because they don't hear themselves.
[02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:35.420]   So they feel like, or, and you know, people don't hear an echo.
[02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:39.260]   So they feel like everything's working, but to do that, what they have to do is remove
[02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:40.940]   a whole bunch of your audio.
[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:44.660]   So you're not going to sound nearly as good if you, if you don't have headphones on.
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:50.140]   And the key is to try to figure out, uh, you know, how to do it as subtly as possible.
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:51.660]   That's when you know you, you've made it.
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:55.580]   If you're a contributor on one of those shows and they send you to an audiologist, they
[02:03:55.580 --> 02:04:00.100]   now they're going to have you back a lot because it's expensive to get the molds made.
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:01.100]   Yeah.
[02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:02.100]   Yeah.
[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:03.100]   Uh, good pick.
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:08.900]   Um, now I can't hear you very well because I want my headphones back.
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:14.900]   Alex, Alex, I respect your opinion, but I can't get my hair to look good before 3 PM.
[02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:20.620]   And until that changes, I'm wearing a hat and I'm wearing earphones over that hat.
[02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:21.820]   It's Andy's luck.
[02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:22.820]   It's Andy's luck.
[02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:23.820]   Exactly.
[02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:27.380]   But I also think, you know, Mac break is, is still very much a radio show.
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:32.180]   You know, we, we, we, we have radio mics and, and so I think it's less of a, less of pressure
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:33.180]   here on the show.
[02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:34.180]   It's in character.
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:35.180]   But I think that.
[02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:36.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:37.180]   It's authenticity.
[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:40.180]   You can't buy in the port.
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:41.180]   I'm going to wear clothes.
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:44.700]   I'm going to have my ears and my regular ears.
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:46.700]   How about that?
[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:48.660]   That's so wild.
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:50.780]   That's belt and suspenders.
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:54.340]   And now I'm listening to one of Andy's operas on the inside.
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:55.980]   But here, that's no, that's, that's it.
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:58.700]   That's another advantage of these like really nice over the year.
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:01.860]   For not only are they really comfortable, but there have been times where I've had to
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:05.980]   commentate on like a live stream so I can have like my earbuds in underneath.
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:08.420]   I have both streams going at the same time.
[02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:10.940]   We, I knew you were doing that last world series.
[02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:11.940]   I could tell.
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:13.580]   Yeah, it wasn't fooled.
[02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:15.300]   Um, no, no, no, not, not.
[02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:17.980]   I was just, I was just concerned that I wouldn't be able to hear you.
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:19.140]   So I was having a game.
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:20.140]   You know, in the penance.
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:22.620]   In case one of the, one of the streams goes out.
[02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:25.620]   Actually, I was doing that in the last super bowl.
[02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:31.900]   So, um, my pick of the two of them, one is still not available, but Google is making
[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:34.780]   its podcast app available on iOS.
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:36.740]   That's, I think it's nice to have more choices.
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:40.780]   It may not be the best podcast app and maybe the one you like the best.
[02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:42.260]   Everybody has their favorite.
[02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:44.100]   Uh, and I'm also using this.
[02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:50.100]   I have to say I have an ulterior motive to encourage you to subscribe to all of our shows.
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:51.820]   Pick your favorite podcast app.
[02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:52.820]   Could be the Googles.
[02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:53.820]   Could be overcast.
[02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:55.020]   Shout cast pocket cast.
[02:05:55.020 --> 02:05:59.220]   You like subscribing, then you'll get Mac break weekly each and every week.
[02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:04.100]   And the other pick I wanted to mention for a while, uh, when COVID broke out, the folks
[02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:10.340]   who make the app plague ink wanted under really were a great pains to say.
[02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:14.140]   Now don't use this to model pandemics.
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:15.140]   This is not science.
[02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:16.940]   It's a game.
[02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:18.180]   Well, guess what?
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:24.460]   They're going to update it to include a pandemic so you can practice the update will actually
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:29.340]   be developed in cooperation with the World Health Organization and global outbreak on
[02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:31.100]   the alert response network.
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:35.820]   Uh, they're also by the way, uh, making a big contribution of a quarter of a million
[02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:42.380]   dollars, uh, to be split between the who solidarity response fund and the coalition of epidemic
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:43.860]   preparedness innovations.
[02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:44.860]   So thank you.
[02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:53.660]   Obviously, plaguing has benefited a little bit from from the from the pandemic and, uh,
[02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:56.980]   you can download it from the app store for 99 cents.
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:58.620]   There are in app purchases available.
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:04.060]   And even though it comes from endemic creations, it was for a long time.
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:07.260]   They said this is not a pandemic simulator, but soon it will be.
[02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:13.140]   And you can practice wiping out COVID-19 to your heart's content.
[02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:18.140]   We should all do that by self isolating, washing our hands, taking care of ourselves.
[02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:23.620]   We want you all to be back here for the next Mac break weekly and every week after that.
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:25.620]   And the Enoco stay safe, stay healthy.
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:26.900]   You can catch him.
[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:31.060]   WGBH Boston, you're going to be on, uh, or are they, they're going to stop those for
[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:32.060]   a while.
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:33.540]   Uh, we're still doing, still doing stuff.
[02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:35.540]   I'm going to be doing it from here.
[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:38.780]   Uh, so fortunately I've got like, what are your radio headphones?
[02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:39.780]   Yeah.
[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:40.780]   Yeah.
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:45.380]   So, uh, so, so we're good, but that's, uh, it's because it's a, it's a news program.
[02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:48.580]   Sometimes they don't know day to day, like what's going to be on, depending on what gets
[02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:53.580]   upset by whom and has to be debunked.
[02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:56.980]   So usually it's going to be Fridays, but that could change week to week.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:57.980]   Uh, Laurie.
[02:07:57.980 --> 02:07:58.980]   Uh, WGBH news.org.
[02:07:58.980 --> 02:08:00.460]   WGBH news.org.
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:07.940]   Laurie Gill, of course she is the star managing editor at imore.com, the lead singer for the
[02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:10.460]   fabulous rock band Sickburn.
[02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:13.100]   Which hasn't even practiced in a couple of weeks.
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:17.180]   So I have to feeling my voice is going to get a little better by the time we finally
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:18.180]   start getting back.
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:20.120]   my voice is actually going to clear up.
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:20.540]   Wow.
[02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:22.420]   So you'll see, you'll see it's already better.
[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:22.780]   Right?
[02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:24.740]   Yeah, you're going to see over the next couple of weeks
[02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:27.040]   when I don't sing it gets clear.
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:28.620]   And that rasp goes away a little bit.
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:31.020]   She's going to sound like that baritone at the Metropolitan
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:31.780]   Office going to be.
[02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.380]   Still sick, but not so Bernie.
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:34.380]   Exactly.
[02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:38.520]   That's Renee Richie, imor.com and Vectored.
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:40.460]   Don't forget the Vectored podcast.
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:42.660]   The video is imor.com/vector.
[02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:43.700]   What's coming up?
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:48.000]   I just put up the MacBook Air and the iPad Pro review,
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.540]   and I will have a special video either the very late
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:53.740]   this week or very early next week.
[02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:54.220]   Stay tuned.
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:56.180]   Oh, a special video.
[02:08:56.180 --> 02:08:58.500]   Very nice.
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:08:59.420]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:00.380]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:01.500]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.260]   Oh, I didn't plug Alex.
[02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:05.820]   090.media.
[02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:09.260]   Now's the time to take advantage of Alex and his crack
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:13.940]   team of streaming professionals to bring your conference or event
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:15.500]   to a wide audience.
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:16.900]   How's that?
[02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:17.660]   Sounds beautiful.
[02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:18.560]   Yeah, I should write that down.
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:20.000]   Oh, 9/0, me.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.240]   I'm very impressed that Alex could afford himself
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:25.680]   to do handle the streaming for the show.
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:26.800]   I'm very impressed.
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:27.400]   Yeah.
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:28.600]   He did a nice job, too.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:29.720]   Let me tell you.
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:30.120]   Thank you.
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:31.760]   By the way, a bunch of us are going
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:34.360]   to be geeking out tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock,
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:37.280]   talking gear, and then I'm going to be talking about Zoom
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:39.400]   at 11 o'clock tomorrow, and I'll put the information
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:40.080]   up on my Twitter.
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:41.920]   So that's really good.
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:42.680]   Yeah.
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:44.600]   Yeah.
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:49.060]   A-L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y on the Twitter.
[02:09:49.060 --> 02:09:51.400]   And I'm threatening to start streaming every day until this
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:53.620]   ends, but it'll be early in the morning.
[02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:54.820]   It'll be like 7 a.m.
[02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:55.820]   Just to do Q&A.
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:56.940]   I'm not going to do any shows.
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:58.860]   I'm just going to turn it on and talk to people.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:00.540]   I think there's a lot of people.
[02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:03.580]   Everybody has so many questions about virtual events right
[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:03.900]   now.
[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:05.500]   And I feel like the easiest thing for me to do
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:08.020]   is just turn it on and then just start fielding questions
[02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:11.500]   and maybe drag people on that makes sense and just kind of--
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:11.600]   Yes.
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:13.260]   But at first, the first three or four days,
[02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:16.280]   I think it might be as early as tomorrow.
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:18.080]   But if you follow me on Twitter, I'll post out links.
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:20.560]   But I'm going to probably just open it up as an open--
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.920]   like office hours.
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:23.600]   Very nice.
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:24.520]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:25.280]   Thank you, Renee.
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:26.200]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:28.120]   Thank you, Laurie.
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:30.880]   Thank you most importantly.
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:33.880]   Thank you, you, for listening and watching.
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:37.640]   We do Mac break weekly on Tuesdays right after iOS today.
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:39.520]   In fact, it's a great all-apple day.
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:41.640]   If you tune in at 9 for iOS today,
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:44.820]   and then around 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time,
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:48.700]   1,700 UTC for Mac break weekly.
[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:53.500]   You can watch live or stream live or listen live, rather,
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:54.940]   at twitter.tv/live.
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:56.380]   That's the live streams.
[02:10:56.380 --> 02:11:00.180]   A lot of choices there, including the brand new 480p YouTube
[02:11:00.180 --> 02:11:01.180]   format.
[02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:03.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:04.820]   You can still go up.
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:05.380]   You just get just--
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:05.900]   Oh, OK.
[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:06.820]   It's just standard.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:09.100]   I think they're living a bandwidth conservation--
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:10.620]   I think they're starting to live in it.
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:11.300]   Yeah.
[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:13.460]   So I think it's in Europe you can't go up.
[02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:15.280]   But I think in the rest of the world,
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.220]   I think it's just that it's default to a lower quality.
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:21.380]   Yeah.
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:24.220]   You can also download copies of the show anytime you need it.
[02:11:24.220 --> 02:11:26.360]   Twit.tv/mbw.
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:28.920]   That's our website, twit.tv/mbw.
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:30.540]   We're on YouTube as well.
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:32.700]   In fact, you can ask your smart assistant
[02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:34.700]   to play the latest episode of Mac break weekly.
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:38.020]   Just say echo, play Mac break weekly on Echo.
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:39.740]   Sometimes if you say on tune and it helps,
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:42.780]   I always say podcast for some reason that seems to help.
[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:44.980]   But you'll figure out the exact syntax
[02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:48.580]   for your favorite smart assistant, voice assistant.
[02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:49.980]   We do encourage you to subscribe.
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:51.420]   That helps us a lot.
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:53.740]   Downloads on all the shows have been off a little bit.
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:54.740]   I think because people have been
[02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:56.540]   other concerned about other things,
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:58.820]   but also because people aren't in the car as much as they
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:11:59.580]   used to be.
[02:11:59.580 --> 02:12:00.980]   So do us a favor.
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:02.660]   Listen at home, will you?
[02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:04.060]   We've got a lot of great programming,
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:06.620]   and we're going to keep going because we
[02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:09.660]   want to keep your company during these difficult times.
[02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:10.660]   Thanks for being everybody.
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:15.380]   Now go back to work from home because break time is over.
[02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:16.260]   Maybe it's lunch time.
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:17.500]   I don't know.
[02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:20.860]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:24.220]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:26.800]   (upbeat music)
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:29.380]   (upbeat music)
